      "The immune system has evolved to protect the host against infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, and to detect and eliminate potentially harmful foreign material.

      "Cellular immunity. Surface T cell receptors (TCRs) are specific to individual antigens, and are activated when the TCR binds to the appropriate antigen. The availability of T cells to respond to the wide variety of potential antigens is achieved through extensive random rearrangements in the TCR gene during T-cell development in the thymus. Inevitably, such random rearrangements will occasionally produce TCRs that bind to 'self' antigens; in this situation, the T cells are eliminated or deactivated in a process known as self-tolerance. If this process is incomplete, autoimmune diseases may arise. T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of APCs in association with MHC molecules. CD4+ T cells, which are subdivided into helper (T h) and regulatory (T reg) T cells, recognize antigens bound to MHC class II molecules. Activation of T h cells, which requires a weaker stimulus than for cytotoxic T cells, leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells including APCs. There are two types of CD4+ T cell responses. Th1 responses are primarily directed against intracellular pathogens, and are characterized by production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, induction of opsonization, and antibody production by B cells. Th2 responses are effective against extracellular bacteria and parasites, and are characterized by production of interleukin (IL)-4 and -5. T reg cells mainly regulate and suppress the immune response of naive and effector T cells through a variety of cytokine and signaling mechanisms, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10. T reg cells regulate the immune response to common environmental allergens and prevent the development of atopy or undesirable inflammation. However, their role in maintenance of peripheral tolerance is also used by cancers to evade the immune system. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (also known as killer T cells) are activated by antigens from intracellular pathogens presented on MHC class I molecules. Activation of these cells triggers a process known as clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells (Teff). These cells recognize cells with a unique MHC class I-antigen complex, and release enzymes and toxins that lyse the cell membrane and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). To prevent extensive tissue damage during an infection, activation of CD8+ cells requires three signals (Figure 1.4).\n",

      "Previously identified genes have been pivotal to understanding the process of neurodegeneration. However, the clinical impact of these gene mutations has been limited because they are usually identified in patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (exempli gratia with PARK2 and PINK1 [also known as PARK6 ]) or with atypical parkinsonism (as with MAPT). In the genome-wide scan for Parkinson's disease (GenePD) study, which investigated the effect of heterozygous PARK2 mutations on age of onset in patients with familial Parkinson's disease, one member from each of 183 families was screened for PARK2 mutations: 12.6% of the families were positive. Of these, 43% were compound heterozygotes, 13% were homozygotes and 10% were heterozygotes. The age of onset of Parkinson's disease was significantly lower in those with one PARK2 mutation than in those with none (11.7 years earlier), and also significantly lower in those with two mutations than in those with one (13.2 years earlier). The study showed that the PARK2 mutation is not rare, and that heterozygosity significantly lowers the age of onset of Parkinson's disease. Clinically, however, it is not possible to distinguish between patients with a Parkin -, PINK1 - and DJ-1 -linked form of Parkinson's disease. Studies in twins have been performed since 1967. Ward et al. studied 43 monozygotic and 19 dizygotic pairs of twins, and found that the concordance rate for parkinsonism was no more frequent in twins than expected, given the general rate of disease. They concluded that the main causative factors are probably not genetic. However, Parkinson's disease may be asymptomatic in the unaffected twin. Burn et al. studied 18-fluorodopa PET scans in sets of twins in which one of each pair had clinical Parkinson's disease. The clinically unaffected twin frequently had abnormally low 18-fluorodopa uptake. Follow-up of some of the twins revealed worsening of this abnormality, suggesting progressive deterioration of nigrostriatal function. The PET findings suggested concordance rates of 45% for monozygotic and 29% for dizygotic twins. Therefore, it seems that some genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease is likely.\n",

      "Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. Although most patients with generalized MG have antibodies to AChR (see below), a minority of patients without AChR antibodies have antibodies to the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK). As discussed in Chapter 1, a higher percentage of patients with treatment-refractory MG have been found to have MuSK antibodies than those who respond to treatment. The disease can be particularly severe in patients with MuSK antibodies (see below). At present it is unclear how MuSK antibodies cause MG, but it is possible that MuSK antibodies alter AChR density or number. MuSK signaling is crucial for the development, long-term maintenance and stabilization of the postsynaptic portion of the NMJ. The antibodies in MuSK MG are largely of the IgG4 subclass and have been demonstrated in vitro to block the assembly and activation of MuSK. In animal models, administration of MuSK antibodies has resulted in reduced postsynaptic AChRs, disturbed synaptic alignment, reduced synaptic potentials and impaired muscle activation.

Of these, 15% are discovered to have thymoma, and the remainder have evidence of lymphoid hyperplasia.

Given the propensity of glioblastoma for rapid spread along white matter tracts, it is often considered to be a multifocal disease, even though this is not consistently visible on imaging. Distant metastases, however, are virtually non-existent, so staging can be achieved from brain imaging only. Although spinal dissemination of glioblastoma is uncommon, if spinal drop metastases are suspected (exempli gratia on discovery of intracranial leptomeningeal disease), post-gadolinium spine imaging from the skull base to the sacrum (id est along the entire vertebral canal) should be considered as part of the diagnostic work-up.

      "Functional MRI (fMRI) measures dynamic blood oxygen level-dependent variations in brain activity. For the purpose of surgical planning, this usually requires the patient to perform specific tasks (task-based fMRI). Most commonly, fMRI can assess language lateralization or motor cortical activation in relation to the tumor. fMRI is considered less reliable for accurate language localization, because the activation of language regions is complex, multifocal and not comprehensively explored by basic fMRI tasks. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) builds on standard diffusion-weighted imaging (see page 36) by including additional (a minimum of six) diffusion directions. These multidirectional data enable both the volume and the directionality of diffusion to be calculated. DTI tractography provides an approximation of the relations between the most eloquent white matter tracts and the tumor. Distances are usually expressed as estimates rather than exact (exempli gratia millimeter) measurements, because the depiction of white matter fibers can vary depending on the segmentation technique and threshold settings. Task-based fMRI and DTI tractography are valuable tools for localizing eloquent cortical and subcortical areas before glioma surgery (Figure 4.1), providing better accuracy than intraoperative stimulation mapping data.\n",

      "Radiotherapy. Postoperative radiotherapy alone was standard treatment until it was demonstrated that external beam radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy was more effective than radiotherapy alone (see below). This treatment is not usually administered until about 4 weeks after surgery when the craniotomy wound has healed. Three-dimensional conformal beam or intensity-modulated radiotherapy is then delivered as 60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Doses above this are associated with increased toxicity with no additional survival benefit. Chemotherapy. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine-derived alkylating agent that is 100% bioavailable when taken orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 hour. Because of its small size and lipophilic properties, it can cross the blood-brain barrier. Temozolomide is administered orally at 75 mg/m daily during radiotherapy. After a duration of approximately 1 month, this is followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 150-200 mg/m on days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle. Temozolomide acts by preventing DNA replication through alkyl group-mediated crosslinking of DNA. Clinical data. The standard of care described above is based on the results of the 2005 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26981-22981/National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group CE3 randomized Phase III trial of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiotherapy alone in 573 patients with glioblastoma. In this trial, median OS was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death in the radiotherapy/temozolomide group was 0.63 (95% CI 0.52-0.75, p < 0.001). In patients whose tumors contained a methylated MGMT promoter (see page 18), median OS was significantly longer with temozolomide and radiotherapy than with radiotherapy alone (21.7 [95% CI 17.4-30.4] versus 15.3 [13.0-20.9] months; p > 0.007).

In 2019, Hegi and colleagues reported a study that examined the optimal cut-off for definition of MGMT methylation based on four randomized trials involving 1725 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who received standard radiotherapy and temozolomide. A cut-off of greater than 1.27 was identified as high MGMT methylation that would render a tumor more sensitive to temozolomide. The cut-off for 'truly unmethylated' tumors was -0.28 or lower; approximately 10% of tumors were in the 'gray zone' (< −0.28, <= 1.27). The authors concluded that low MGMT methylation status within the 'gray zone' may confer some sensitivity to temozolomide therapy and recommended that the lower safety margin should be used to select patients with unmethylated tumors for inclusion in trials that do not include temozolomide.

Most myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic conditions that remain clinically stable for many years; however, the condition may progress to acute leukemia in a minority of patients, referred to as MPN blast phase (MPN-BP). This transformation most commonly occurs in patients with myelofibrosis, in whom transformation rates of 15-30% have been reported, compared with 1-4% for patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 4-9% for those with polycythemia vera (PV)., Typically, patients with ET or PV initially develop post-ET or post-PV myelofibrosis, which may subsequently undergo transformation to MPN-BP, although in rare cases these conditions may transform directly into MPN-BP without an intermediate myelofibrotic stage., Risk factors for the development of MPN-BP include leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and unfavorable karyotype (Table 9.1). There are no specific diagnostic criteria for MPN-BP. The principal criterion is the same as for de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML): more than 20% blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Persistence is also important if only peripheral blood blasts are considered. Importantly, acceleration or progression of myelofibrosis is usually apparent before the development of overt leukemia. Signs of this include. worsening cytopenia or anemia. worsening of constitutional symptoms. progressive and resistant splenomegaly. increasing numbers of blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood. rising lactate dehydrogenase. new cytogenetic or molecular marker.

In this approach, hormone therapy is initially given for 6-9 months. If PSA levels become normalized, the LHRH analog/antagonist is temporarily discontinued. Hormone therapy is resumed when serum PSA returns to pretreatment levels in those with a PSA below 20 ng/mL at diagnosis, or when PSA exceeds 20 ng/mL in patients with an initial PSA above this. Such a regimen allows serum testosterone to return to normal, thereby stimulating atrophic cells and rendering them more sensitive to androgen ablation (Figure 7.4). The use of a pure LHRH antagonist, which blocks the receptor without initial stimulation (see page 89), could be advantageous in this setting given the absence of flare and, potentially, a more rapid restoration of testosterone level after cessation of therapy.\n",

The primary functions of the gluteal muscles are to support, stabilize and mobilize the hips and lower extremities in relation to the pelvis and the trunk. Possibly the most common manifestation of lumbar and lumbosacral pain referral is to the mid-portion of the gluteal muscles (buttocks) that overlie the piriformis muscle. This is accompanied by a palpable localized region of deep, tender muscle induration. Because of the thickness of the overlying gluteus maximus muscle, the fibers of which are parallel to (and indistinguishable from) the piriformis muscle fibers, it is not possible to determine by palpation if the piriformis muscle per se is the source of the localized muscle tenderness.

Patients in whom recurrence occurs more than 6 months after primary platinum treatment are often subdivided into two groups. highly platinum-sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs more than 12 months after primary platinum treatment. intermediately sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs 6-12 months after primary treatment. Platinum-resistant patients, in whom recurrence occurs within 6 months of primary platinum treatment, are generally treated with non-platinum options; these usually include single agent chemotherapies with or without bevacizumab. Some clinicians define patients who actually progress on front-line treatment as platinum-refractory. They are often treated similarly to platinum-resistant patients, although some clinicians recommend continuing the platinum backbone while substituting the taxane with an alternative chemotherapeutic.\n",

      "Stress (or effort-related) incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine during physical exertion. This occurs without any contraction of the detrusor and may be associated with a number of physical activities, including laughing, coughing, sneezing, running, jumping, aerobics and sexual activity. Urine loss is usually in small amounts (drops, squirts) and may not be a daily event. It is caused by failure of the bladder outlet to remain closed and thereby maintain continence when intra-abdominal pressure is raised. Urgency (previously called urge) incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine accompanied, or immediately preceded, by urgency. Urgency incontinence can take the form of frequent small losses between voids or large urine losses from sudden complete bladder emptying. It can occur several times a day or week. It is caused by involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling/urine storage. Nocturnal enuresis is the loss of urine during sleep. When taking a history, it is important to inquire about childhood nocturnal enuresis (bed-wetting), as delayed bladder control in childhood is often associated with detrusor overactivity in adulthood.\n",

      "Huntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes loss of cognitive functions, involuntary movements and emotional instabilities. The underlying genetic problem is the extension of a CAG trinucleotide repeat located in the HTT gene, encoding the huntingtin protein. While the CAG segment is normally repeated 10 to 35 times within the HTT gene, people with 40 or more repeats nearly always develop disease. Huntington's disease usually appears in people in their thirties or forties. The increased size of the CAG segment leads to the synthesis of an abnormally elongated huntingtin protein, which is broken down into smaller toxic fragments that aggregate and accumulate in neurons, thereby disrupting normal cell function and eventually leading to death of neurons. Hope for treatment of this disease comes from preclinical studies using AAV vectors that express not a therapeutic protein but a micro (mi)RNA that targets the HTT messenger (m)RNA and induces its degradation (the miRNA machinery of post-transcriptional regulation has evolved to specifically eliminate unwanted gene expression in a given cell type) (Figure 6.1). For example, an AAV5-miHTT vector was able to decrease production of the huntingtin protein by more than 50% in areas of gene transfer in the brains of minipigs that had been injected with the vector. Intracranial injections led to dose-dependent vector distribution to the striatum, putamen and spreading to the cerebral cortex. These areas are affected by neuropathological changes at different stages of the disease.\n",

The accumulation of glycogen affects functions of multiple tissues. Children with GSDIa may have thin arms and legs, short stature and suffer from enlarged livers and kidneys. The hypoglycemia that results from the disease can be life-threatening. If chronically untreated, severe lactic acidosis, progression to renal failure and even death may occur in infancy or childhood. While there are no pharmacological therapies, consumption of sugar-free foods and drinks and regular intake of uncooked cornstarch, combined with other dietary adjustments, is helpful, particularly in milder forms of the disease. An investigational gene therapy is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial, based on systemic delivery of an AAV8 vector with hopes of achieving stable expression and activity of G6Pase-alpha under control of its native gene promoter. In preclinical studies, this gene therapy was particularly effective in reducing hepatic glycogen levels. Clinical efficacy measures include time to hypoglycemia during a controlled in-hospital fasting challenge, glycogen storage in liver (as determined by MRI) and changes in biomarkers such as lipids and uric acid. It has been reported that 'two of three patients in the first dose cohort experienced a sufficient increase in time to hypoglycemia such that they may be able to sleep through the night without taking supplemental cornstarch'.

These can be engineered in such a way that the packaging capacity of the vector is not exceeded. Using these constructs, dystrophin transgene expression in muscle fibers of patients has already been demonstrated following local intramuscular administration of vector. Furthermore, AAV capsids (such as AAV9 or AAVrh10) have been identified that are capable of infecting muscles throughout the body following high-dose intravascular administration. Intravascular delivery of AAV vectors expressing microdystrophins significantly ameliorated muscle pathology, increased muscle force and attenuated dystrophic cardiomyopathy in various small and large animal models such as dystrophic mice and dogs. Multiple competing Phase I/II clinical trials have now been initiated to test this approach in patients with DMD (Figure 6.2). These utilize AAV9 or AAVrh74 and muscle-specific promoters. Given the very large vector doses that are required (> 10 vector genomes/kg), there are some concerns for toxicities and immune responses. For instance, dystrophic muscles may be inflamed, and T-cell responses against therapeutic dystrophin have been observed in some patients in prior clinical studies. While steroids are given to limit inflammation, incidents of complement activation have also been reported.

For these reasons, in general, serial monotherapy trials of two AEDs that are appropriate first-line treatment for the patient's seizure type(s) should be undertaken before combinations are tried (Figure 4.1).

      "Not all of the decrease in consumption involves smokers giving up altogether; in some cases smokers merely reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke. The health benefits of this action may be undermined, however, because smokers tend to smoke each cigarette more intensively. It is also not fully known how reductions in consumption translate into health benefits. Nevertheless, it is clear that increasing the cost of smoking is, potentially, an important public health measure. Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence. The size of the effect is related to the intensity of the campaign (as indexed by viewing numbers) and whether it is sustained. Specific quitting events, for example the UK's 'No Smoking Day' and 'Stoptober' (a mass quitting event that challenges smokers to be smoke-free for a month as a stepping stone to permanent cessation), and the US 'Great American Smokeout' (which encourages quitting for a day), have been evaluated as a highly cost-effective way of promoting smoking cessation. Bans on tobacco advertising. Tobacco companies spend many billions of dollars annually promoting their brands.

      "Genetic factors. The current state of the genetics of eating disorders is that while there is familial clustering of these syndromes, it is not at all clear that they are in their entirety genetically transmitted disorders. Whatever the genetic component to each one of them, it seems to be stronger for anorexia than bulimia. And granting even that, the current literature supports a polygenetic transmission of risk which needs substantial accumulation of environmental risk to have disorders come to the fore. The most potent risk factor for eating disorders is female gender (see Chapter 2). This association is likely to reflect biological as well as psychosocial factors. Family studies indicate that first-degree relatives of patients with anorexia have an increased prevalence of eating disorders (Table 3.1), and that first-degree relatives of patients with bulimia or binge-eating disorder appear to be at increased risk of eating disorders, mood disorders and substance abuse. Twin studies of anorexia and bulimia suggest there is approximately a 50-80% genetic contribution to liability accounted for by additive genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have initially focused on the serotonergic and other neurotransmitter system genes involved in bodyweight regulation, with hardly any unequivocally confirmed findings. Systematic genome-wide linkage scans based on families with at least two individuals with an eating disorder revealed initial linkage regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 4 (anorexia) and 10p (bulimia). Ongoing international collaborations are working at pooling cases and using newer forms of analysis such as genome-wide associations. Similar to other complex disorders, the eating disorders are likely to have a polygenic etiology, each gene having a relatively small effect. Physiological factors. Both high and low premorbid body mass index (BMI) may predispose to anorexia. Being overweight or obese (with a high BMI) is a risk factor because of the likelihood of dieting, while low BMI may characterize individuals who are already prodromally ill with anorexia but who have not yet reached the weight criteria for definitive diagnosis.\n",

This results in a rising fasting glucose: as the insulin secretory capacity diminishes, fasting glucose rises further (Figure 4.2). Insulin secretion is further hindered by rising glucose levels which directly damage beta cells through a mechanism called glucotoxicity. Lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes is found in the muscle cells, where glucose is the major substrate. However, it has also been reported in the pancreas, where the effects of excess lipid can contribute to damage to insulin-secreting beta cells.

      "How cancer immunotherapy works. In the context of cancer, the term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic targets. The history of immuno-oncology. The concept of immuno-oncology dates back more than 100 years, to 1893 (Figure 3.1). In that year, William Coley, an American surgeon and cancer researcher, observed remission of cancer in patients with postoperative bacterial infections, and suggested that activation of the immune system must play a role in combating cancer., Subsequently, in 1909, Paul Ehrlich suggested that the immune system must play an important role in preventing the development of cancer. However, it was not until the mid-20th century when Lewis Thomas and Frank MacFarlane Burnet hypothesized that the immune system is capable of eliminating cancerous cells through a process known as immune surveillance, and that this process depends on recognition of tumor-associated antigens by the immune system., Subsequently, through the laboratory work of Lloyd Old and Robert Schreiber, the concept of immune surveillance has evolved into 'immunoediting', reflecting the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. Increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of immunoediting has identified numerous potential therapeutic targets, some of which - notably immune checkpoint inhibition as first demonstrated by James Allison in the 1990s - are already yielding promising results in clinical practice., Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science.\n",

A key issue in immuno-oncology is that patients may show a survival benefit in the absence of an objective response as defined by conventional RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Response to immunotherapies may vary markedly between patients: while some patients may show an initial response or stable disease, in others the response may be delayed because of the need to restore T-cell responses - a process that requires the interaction of numerous other immune cells. Indeed, in some patients, there is an initial phase of pseudoprogression during which the tumor appears to enlarge due to infiltration of newly reactivated T cells and subsequent inflammation.

Some immunotherapies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, are associated with immune-related adverse events such as fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and altered liver or kidney function (Figure 3.4). Many of these resemble the adverse events often seen with conventional chemotherapy but have different etiologies: while adverse events with conventional chemotherapy usually reflect cytotoxic effects on healthy tissue, adverse events with immunotherapies typically reflect actions on the immune system. For example, diarrhea associated with immunotherapy may be due to a reaction to gut-associated or self-antigens. Such adverse events require careful management, because although most are mild or moderate in severity, failure to recognize them as immune related could lead to suboptimal management, with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. For example, if untreated, diarrhea from immune-related colitis may become self-perpetuating, potentially leading to gut perforation. Patient education about such adverse events is essential: patients should be warned not to ignore 'slight' or 'mild' symptoms, but to seek medical advice as soon as possible.

In contrast, patients with moderate-to-severe AP may require aggressive fluid resuscitation and they have prolonged pain and sometimes intolerance to oral refeeding. These patients may develop organ failure (OF) and are prone to late complications. Virtually all patients without OF will survive, but OF is associated with an increased risk of mortality. Early detection of OF is particularly important.\n",

      "However, local complications such as pancreatic necrosis are associated with fluid sequestration, as intravascular liquid leaks to the retroperitoneum. This results in hemoconcentration and it has been suggested that an increased hematocrit is in fact a marker for local complications, not their cause (reverse causation bias). In 2009 and 2010, two studies were published by the same research group., These were open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a more aggressive versus a moderate fluid volume administration (10-15 vs 5-10 mL/kg/hour) and a more rapid versus a slower hemodilution (hematocrit < 35% vs >= 35% at 48 hours) in patients with severe AP according to the classic 1993 Atlanta criteria (presence of local complications and/or organ failure). In both trials, the more aggressive approach was associated with worse outcomes, including decreased survival. These studies suggested that vigorous resuscitation is dangerous in patients with severe AP. The studies had some flaws, including being open-label single-center RCTs, with suboptimal randomization, an unexpectedly high rate of sepsis in patients with aggressive resuscitation and large differences in mortality between treatment groups despite a very small sample of patients, and they require validation.\n",

Both an open-label and a triple-blind RCT have demonstrated that fluid resuscitation using lactated Ringer's solution (a balanced salt solution) is associated with a decreased inflammatory response when compared with fluid resuscitation with normal saline (with a high chloride content). According to in vitro experiments, it seems that this anti-inflammatory effect depends on lactate. However, both studies included a small number of patients, and the influence of lactated Ringer's solution on important outcomes such as OF or mortality is unknown. In studies addressing other clinical scenarios, balanced fluids such as lactated Ringer's solution seem to be associated with a decreased need for blood products and a lower incidence of renal replacement therapy, hyperkalemia and postoperative infections when compared with normal saline.

      "However, placement of a nasojejunal tube is not easy, it is time-consuming and results in great patient discomfort. Furthermore, it has been shown that standard nasojejunal feeding does in fact stimulate pancreatic secretion. Three studies comparing a nasogastric versus a nasojejunal route found no difference in outcomes, so both feeding routes can be recommended, depending on the presence or absence of gastric outlet obstruction. In 2014, the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group published an RCT in patients with predicted severe AP which compared early (within 24 hours) nasojejunal enteral nutrition versus on-demand nasojejunal enteral nutrition (the patients tried oral refeeding on the third day and enteral nutrition was given on the fourth day only to those who could not tolerate oral feeding). The study showed that on-demand oral feeding was not associated with worse outcomes, and only 31% of patients needed a nasojejunal tube. Overall, therefore, in patients with moderate-to-severe AP, oral refeeding on day 3 to 4 should be encouraged and nasogastric or nasojejunal tube feeding from day 4 should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate oral refeeding or who are sedated.

      "Chemoprevention refers to the use of drugs to reduce the risk of cancer. The 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride has been shown to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer by 24.8% compared with placebo over a 7-year period, although at the cost of a small but significant increase in sexual side effects. However, this is counterbalanced by the finding that a small proportion of cancers in the finasteride group tended to be more aggressive than those in the placebo group, although this may have been an artifact of taking biopsies from the smaller prostates in the active treatment arm resulting from the shrinkage effect of finasteride. A 2013 study reported that there was no difference in the overall survival (OS) rate, or survival after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, between the placebo-treated and finasteride-treated patients after 18 years of follow-up. Another 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, has been evaluated for its effect on the occurrence of prostate cancer in the REDUCE study (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events). Dutasteride resulted in a 23% reduction in the development of prostate cancer, mainly by suppressing the well-differentiated cancers, with only a slight (statistically insignificant) increase in Gleason pattern 7 or 8-10 poorly differentiated tumors. It also effectively treated the symptoms arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Neither of these compounds were approved by the regulatory authorities for chemoprevention.\n",

The clinical syndrome of HF represents the final manifestation of advanced disease. Although progress has been made in the management of this entity, the greatest hope of avoiding the adverse outcome of HF is to intervene at an earlier subclinical stage, when there is more likelihood of reversing the process. The American Cardiology Association (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines divide progression of the disease into four preclinical and clinical stages (Table 2.1). It is important to distinguish these from functional classes, as described in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which is based on severity of symptoms and exercise capacity and can be used to assess response to treatment (see Table 2.1). ACC/AHA stages A and B are preclinical; these patients fall into NYHA functional class I. ACC/AHA stage C reflects patients with symptoms or signs of HF, so these patients may be classified functionally in any of the NYHA classes I to III. The functional status of patients in ACC/AHA class D (with marked symptoms and signs of HF) is usually limited (NYHA class II to IV).

      "Reasons to suspect P. acnes resistance are shown in Table 8.4. There are concerns that overuse of antibiotics will drive resistance in other commensal bacteria. Preventing resistance. It is difficult to culture P. acnes and, therefore, some overall guidelines are necessary to help the physician correctly suspect, prevent and treat P. acnes resistance. The emergence of resistance has raised the need for antibiotic prescribing policies and the need to consider the use of non-antibiotic preparations wherever possible. Principles for the optimal use of oral antibiotics are summarized in Table 8.5. Current thinking is that antibiotics should be administered for the shortest duration possible, and that combining them initially with topical retinoids will enhance efficacy. The advised length of treatment is 12 weeks. If longer than 12 weeks is required, anti-resistance agents such as BPO must be used concurrently. Combining non-antibiotic and antibiotic therapies results in more rapid efficacy, and this in turn may reduce the antibiotic exposure time. The same antibiotic should be used again if it previously produced a good clinical response. Antibiotics should not be used in the maintenance phase of therapy. P. acnes resistance should be suspected in patients who are not responding, patients who were responding but have relapsed, and those who have had 2-3 courses of different topical and oral antibiotics. Suspected resistant P. acnes should be targeted with antibiotics for which there is less evidence of resistance; higher rather than lower doses of a topical antibiotic should also be used. Likewise, higher oral doses of therapy may be indicated. Some preparations, such as non-antibiotic antimicrobials, id est BPO and topical retinoids, will never be associated with P. acnes resistance, nor will oral contraceptives or oral isotretinoin.\n",

The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). These data sources include electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile technologies. Real-world evidence is the evidence derived from real-world data. In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute real-world data. However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial. They do not represent the overall population in a certain indication. Therefore, when working with clinical research, it is important to focus on the benefits of health-related data collected in natural settings - which may not be classified as 'real world' by a strict regulatory definition.\n",

      "Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations documented in all subtypes (Table 5.3)., The KIT mutation is associated with chronic sun damage. The BRAF mutation is present in 11% of patients with mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutation in 5% and KIT mutation in 15-20%. From a molecular point of view, uveal melanoma is a distinct condition characterized, in 50% of patients, by the presence of a GNAQ mutation. The presence of BRAF and NRAS mutations has not been described in uveal melanoma. The serine/threonine kinase BRAF is involved in the downstream signaling of the RTK and RAS proteins. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations (Figure 5.2). In the majority of cases, a valine at position 600 is mutated to glutamic acid or lysine (BRAF p.V600E and BRAF p.V600K); both mutations are associated with kinase activation that results from relieving an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction between the activation segment and P-loop of the protein.\n",

      "BRAF mutations are most common in the nodular and superficial spreading melanoma types, and they are rare in acral lentiginous (5-10% of cases) and non-cutaneous melanomas. BRAF mutation correlates with distinct histopathological features, such as intraepidermal melanoma nest formation and a larger rounder border of the tumor with the surrounding skin, suggesting surrogate markers can be used to select patients for molecular testing. BRAF mutations also arise more commonly in patients who are younger at presentation and those with lymph node metastasis (rather than satellite tumors or visceral metastasis). BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma, though these may be of short duration in some patients. Approximately 20% of patients with mutant BRAF melanoma show no response, and most patients treated with monotherapy relapse, with a median PFS of 8-9 months.\n",

      "The immune system has evolved to protect the host against infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, and to detect and eliminate potentially harmful foreign material. A hallmark of cancer is that tumor cells - which would normally be recognized by the immune system as abnormal - acquire the ability to evade the immune system. Immuno-oncology is a new, multi-faceted and rapidly evolving collection of treatment strategies aimed at harnessing immune processes to target and destroy tumor cells and prolong survival. An understanding of the basic elements of the normal and tumor-altered immune system is therefore key to understanding potential immuno-oncology therapies. The immune system consists of two components: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is conferred by mechanisms that are present throughout life, such as the physical barriers to infection provided by the skin and mucous membranes, white blood cells that remove foreign material, and serum proteins such as lysozymes and kinins.\n",

      "Cellular immunity. Surface T cell receptors (TCRs) are specific to individual antigens, and are activated when the TCR binds to the appropriate antigen. The availability of T cells to respond to the wide variety of potential antigens is achieved through extensive random rearrangements in the TCR gene during T-cell development in the thymus. Inevitably, such random rearrangements will occasionally produce TCRs that bind to 'self' antigens; in this situation, the T cells are eliminated or deactivated in a process known as self-tolerance. If this process is incomplete, autoimmune diseases may arise. T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of APCs in association with MHC molecules. CD4+ T cells, which are subdivided into helper (T h) and regulatory (T reg) T cells, recognize antigens bound to MHC class II molecules. Activation of T h cells, which requires a weaker stimulus than for cytotoxic T cells, leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells including APCs. There are two types of CD4+ T cell responses. Th1 responses are primarily directed against intracellular pathogens, and are characterized by production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, induction of opsonization, and antibody production by B cells. Th2 responses are effective against extracellular bacteria and parasites, and are characterized by production of interleukin (IL)-4 and -5. T reg cells mainly regulate and suppress the immune response of naive and effector T cells through a variety of cytokine and signaling mechanisms, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10. T reg cells regulate the immune response to common environmental allergens and prevent the development of atopy or undesirable inflammation. However, their role in maintenance of peripheral tolerance is also used by cancers to evade the immune system. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (also known as killer T cells) are activated by antigens from intracellular pathogens presented on MHC class I molecules. Activation of these cells triggers a process known as clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells (Teff). These cells recognize cells with a unique MHC class I-antigen complex, and release enzymes and toxins that lyse the cell membrane and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). To prevent extensive tissue damage during an infection, activation of CD8+ cells requires three signals (Figure 1.4).\n",

One likely mechanism involves the development of a powerful 'habit' in which cues associated with smoking trigger an urge to smoke. This occurs because nicotine acts on a part of the brain that learns which responses are useful for survival in different situations. This part of the brain evolved in other species and operates at a level below conscious awareness. Thus, smokers experience urges to smoke when confronted with smoking cues, but these need not stem from any anticipated pleasure from smoking or conscious decision-making process.

Unfortunately, such discomfort can occur for all kinds of reasons, and the smoker's brain is not good at discriminating adverse mood states that arise from nicotine withdrawal from those arising from other causes. This means that smokers learn to associate adverse mood states and difficulty concentrating with smoking, and come to believe that smoking helps them to cope, even though it does so only because they are experiencing the problem because they have not smoked for a while. Unfortunately, as long as they believe that smoking helps to relieve adverse mood and other symptoms, smokers will be at risk of relapse when they try to stop. The sum of motivations.

      "After examining a large number of brains, both clinically normal and with Parkinson's disease, Braak et al. suggested that stage 1 of the disease begins at induction sites in the olfactory system and the dorsal vagal nucleus, with degeneration of the olfactory bulb and the anterior olfactory nucleus. This presents clinically as olfactory dysfunction. Stage 2 reflects progression of the pathological process to the nuclei of the caudal brainstem (the locus ceruleus and other nuclei). The lower brainstem nuclei are key areas mediating a myriad of non-motor symptoms such as sleep homeostasis, depression, fatigue, cognitive problems, pain, constipation and a reduction in central autonomic vagal control. Several of these symptoms are now recognized as possible prodromal features of Parkinson's disease. However, clinical Parkinson's disease tends to be recognized by healthcare professionals only when the condition reaches stage 3, which involves the substantia nigra. Stages 4 to 6 represent further pathological progression to the cortex (Figure 2.3).\n",

      "Previously identified genes have been pivotal to understanding the process of neurodegeneration. However, the clinical impact of these gene mutations has been limited because they are usually identified in patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (exempli gratia with PARK2 and PINK1 [also known as PARK6 ]) or with atypical parkinsonism (as with MAPT). In the genome-wide scan for Parkinson's disease (GenePD) study, which investigated the effect of heterozygous PARK2 mutations on age of onset in patients with familial Parkinson's disease, one member from each of 183 families was screened for PARK2 mutations: 12.6% of the families were positive. Of these, 43% were compound heterozygotes, 13% were homozygotes and 10% were heterozygotes. The age of onset of Parkinson's disease was significantly lower in those with one PARK2 mutation than in those with none (11.7 years earlier), and also significantly lower in those with two mutations than in those with one (13.2 years earlier). The study showed that the PARK2 mutation is not rare, and that heterozygosity significantly lowers the age of onset of Parkinson's disease. Clinically, however, it is not possible to distinguish between patients with a Parkin -, PINK1 - and DJ-1 -linked form of Parkinson's disease. Studies in twins have been performed since 1967. Ward et al. studied 43 monozygotic and 19 dizygotic pairs of twins, and found that the concordance rate for parkinsonism was no more frequent in twins than expected, given the general rate of disease. They concluded that the main causative factors are probably not genetic. However, Parkinson's disease may be asymptomatic in the unaffected twin. Burn et al. studied 18-fluorodopa PET scans in sets of twins in which one of each pair had clinical Parkinson's disease. The clinically unaffected twin frequently had abnormally low 18-fluorodopa uptake. Follow-up of some of the twins revealed worsening of this abnormality, suggesting progressive deterioration of nigrostriatal function. The PET findings suggested concordance rates of 45% for monozygotic and 29% for dizygotic twins. Therefore, it seems that some genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease is likely.\n",

The high concentration of AChRs is crucial for efficient neuromuscular transmission. The ACh depolarizes the muscle endplate region, ultimately causing the muscle to contract (Figure 2.1). Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the best characterized autoimmune disorder of the nervous system. The immune-mediated nature of MG was suspected as early as the 1960s when it was speculated to be caused by a dysregulated immune response, with antibodies directed against skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies. A series of animal and human experiments in the 1970s confirmed the above hypothesis, and elevated titers of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were ultimately discovered in the serum of patients with MG. Loss of AChRs results in impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness.\n",

Complement-mediated lysis is thought to be the most important mode of loss of AChR, but the actual process that initiates the aberrant immune attack on the AChR is unknown. Both the immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody and complement have been localized to the motor endplate in myasthenia models, indicating that circulating IgG antibodies directed against the AChR bind to the postsynaptic membrane and activate the terminal complement sequence (C5b-9), or membrane attack complex (MAC). This results in lysis of the postsynaptic membrane, causing loss of the AChR (Figure 2.2). In fact, elevated MAC levels have been demonstrated in the plasma of patients with MG. 'Binding' antibodies are the most common type found in patients with MG. Accelerated internalization and degradation of acetylcholine receptors. A key mechanism of disease pathology in MG is the modulation, internalization and eventual destruction of AChRs at the NMJ by the crosslinking of AChR-specific autoantibodies (Figure 2.3).

      "Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. Although most patients with generalized MG have antibodies to AChR (see below), a minority of patients without AChR antibodies have antibodies to the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK). As discussed in Chapter 1, a higher percentage of patients with treatment-refractory MG have been found to have MuSK antibodies than those who respond to treatment. The disease can be particularly severe in patients with MuSK antibodies (see below). At present it is unclear how MuSK antibodies cause MG, but it is possible that MuSK antibodies alter AChR density or number. MuSK signaling is crucial for the development, long-term maintenance and stabilization of the postsynaptic portion of the NMJ. The antibodies in MuSK MG are largely of the IgG4 subclass and have been demonstrated in vitro to block the assembly and activation of MuSK. In animal models, administration of MuSK antibodies has resulted in reduced postsynaptic AChRs, disturbed synaptic alignment, reduced synaptic potentials and impaired muscle activation. Role of the thymus. Approximately 75% of patients who undergo thymectomy are found to have thymic pathology. Of these, 15% are discovered to have thymoma, and the remainder have evidence of lymphoid hyperplasia. Myoid cells are located in the thymus gland, and thymus tissue from patients with MG has been found to be enriched with AChR-reactive T cells. The close interaction between lymphocytes and myoid cells in the thymus, together with a yet-to-be-discovered stimulus that disrupts normal immune tolerance, may lead to the autoimmune response triggering MG.\n",

For example, multifocality is thought to be more common in IDH wild-type gliomas than IDH -mutant low-grade gliomas. Given the propensity of glioblastoma for rapid spread along white matter tracts, it is often considered to be a multifocal disease, even though this is not consistently visible on imaging. Distant metastases, however, are virtually non-existent, so staging can be achieved from brain imaging only. Although spinal dissemination of glioblastoma is uncommon, if spinal drop metastases are suspected (exempli gratia on discovery of intracranial leptomeningeal disease), post-gadolinium spine imaging from the skull base to the sacrum (id est along the entire vertebral canal) should be considered as part of the diagnostic work-up.

Positron-emission tomography (PET) is not routinely used in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. However, PET in combination with CT or MRI may play an important role in the future for the staging of pancreatic cancer and patient stratification. Tissue diagnosis may be obtained by brushings during ERCP or fine needle aspirations (FNA) obtained percutaneously or by EUS. However, EUS-guided FNA is the preferred method for tissue diagnosis and has a higher accuracy than ERCP with brush cytology. Preoperative tissue diagnosis may not always be needed in a resectable pancreatic mass if the symptoms, signs, laboratory data and imaging are classic for pancreatic cancer in an otherwise surgically fit patient. However, when a preoperative tissue diagnosis is required in a potentially resectable pancreatic mass, EUS-guided FNA should be the preferred route on account of the lower potential risk of peritoneal seeding, the shorter needle tract and the inclusion of the needle track in the resection specimen (in pancreatic head tumors). Tissue diagnosis may be needed in borderline resectable pancreatic tumors if the patient is to undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy before surgery.\n",

      "Functional MRI (fMRI) measures dynamic blood oxygen level-dependent variations in brain activity. For the purpose of surgical planning, this usually requires the patient to perform specific tasks (task-based fMRI). Most commonly, fMRI can assess language lateralization or motor cortical activation in relation to the tumor. fMRI is considered less reliable for accurate language localization, because the activation of language regions is complex, multifocal and not comprehensively explored by basic fMRI tasks. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) builds on standard diffusion-weighted imaging (see page 36) by including additional (a minimum of six) diffusion directions. These multidirectional data enable both the volume and the directionality of diffusion to be calculated. DTI tractography provides an approximation of the relations between the most eloquent white matter tracts and the tumor. Distances are usually expressed as estimates rather than exact (exempli gratia millimeter) measurements, because the depiction of white matter fibers can vary depending on the segmentation technique and threshold settings. Task-based fMRI and DTI tractography are valuable tools for localizing eloquent cortical and subcortical areas before glioma surgery (Figure 4.1), providing better accuracy than intraoperative stimulation mapping data.\n",

Postoperative radiotherapy alone was standard treatment until it was demonstrated that external beam radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy was more effective than radiotherapy alone (see below). This treatment is not usually administered until about 4 weeks after surgery when the craniotomy wound has healed. Three-dimensional conformal beam or intensity-modulated radiotherapy is then delivered as 60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Doses above this are associated with increased toxicity with no additional survival benefit. Chemotherapy. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine-derived alkylating agent that is 100% bioavailable when taken orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 hour. Because of its small size and lipophilic properties, it can cross the blood-brain barrier. Temozolomide is administered orally at 75 mg/m daily during radiotherapy. After a duration of approximately 1 month, this is followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 150-200 mg/m on days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle. Temozolomide acts by preventing DNA replication through alkyl group-mediated crosslinking of DNA. Clinical data. The standard of care described above is based on the results of the 2005 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26981-22981/National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group CE3 randomized Phase III trial of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiotherapy alone in 573 patients with glioblastoma. In this trial, median OS was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone.

A cut-off of greater than 1.27 was identified as high MGMT methylation that would render a tumor more sensitive to temozolomide.

The authors concluded that low MGMT methylation status within the 'gray zone' may confer some sensitivity to temozolomide therapy and recommended that the lower safety margin should be used to select patients with unmethylated tumors for inclusion in trials that do not include temozolomide. At present, clinicians form their own opinions as to how to apply this in clinical practice.\n",

A problematic issue is the overlap that exists between structural and advanced imaging features of viable tumor and necrotic tissue. On conventional MRI sequences, the early (pseudoprogression; Figure 4.2) and late (radiation necrosis) effects of adjuvant therapy are often indistinguishable from a growing tumor, as both may appear as new or enlarging enhancing lesions due to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The true incidence of therapy effects is debatable, as it depends on the definition of a progressive lesion. This complexity is acknowledged in the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, which take into consideration the timing of adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma serial monitoring.\n",

      "LHRH analogs, such as goserelin acetate, buserelin and leuprorelin (leuprolide acetate), are highly potent LHRH agonists (superagonists). Administration is followed by an initial transient increase in the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH), and hence in testosterone, which lasts about 3 weeks, but this is followed by desensitization (downregulation), resulting in decreased secretion of LH and testosterone (Figure 7.2). These agents can be delivered via 1-, 3- or 6-monthly depot preparations, administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. A potential side effect is tumor 'flare' resulting from the initial transient increase (140-170%) in testosterone, experienced by 8-32% of patients. This may result in increased bone pain or worsening symptoms of bladder outflow or ureteric obstruction; spinal metastases may also be stimulated to expand, increasing the risk of spinal cord compression.

      "It has been suggested that continuous androgen ablation therapy may, in fact, increase the rate of progression of prostate cancer to a castrate-resistant state (see Chapter 8), prompting the exploration of the use of intermittent hormonal therapy, which also has the potential advantage of decreasing the side effects of therapy. In this approach, hormone therapy is initially given for 6-9 months. If PSA levels become normalized, the LHRH analog/antagonist is temporarily discontinued. Hormone therapy is resumed when serum PSA returns to pretreatment levels in those with a PSA below 20 ng/mL at diagnosis, or when PSA exceeds 20 ng/mL in patients with an initial PSA above this. Such a regimen allows serum testosterone to return to normal, thereby stimulating atrophic cells and rendering them more sensitive to androgen ablation (Figure 7.4). The use of a pure LHRH antagonist, which blocks the receptor without initial stimulation (see page 89), could be advantageous in this setting given the absence of flare and, potentially, a more rapid restoration of testosterone level after cessation of therapy.\n",

      "Many anatomic factors can play a primary or a secondary role in the development and progression of low back pain syndromes. The most common causes of low back pain are mechanical in origin. Mechanical disorders of the lumbar spine are related to injury, overuse or deformity of a spinal structure. The most important traumatic factors in low back pain relate to soft tissue structures. Precise identification of the injured tissue, and the role of that injury in the consequent pain and dysfunction, can be frustratingly difficult.

      "The gluteal and piriformis muscles are shown in Figure 3.1. The primary functions of the gluteal muscles are to support, stabilize and mobilize the hips and lower extremities in relation to the pelvis and the trunk. Possibly the most common manifestation of lumbar and lumbosacral pain referral is to the mid-portion of the gluteal muscles (buttocks) that overlie the piriformis muscle. This is accompanied by a palpable localized region of deep, tender muscle induration. Because of the thickness of the overlying gluteus maximus muscle, the fibers of which are parallel to (and indistinguishable from) the piriformis muscle fibers, it is not possible to determine by palpation if the piriformis muscle per se is the source of the localized muscle tenderness. A 'piriformis syndrome' is therefore somewhat problematic to identify and must be carefully distinguished from the more common, spinal discogenic basis for sciatic radiculopathy. A piriformis syndrome may result from scarring after a fall on the buttocks or as a consequence of pelvic or hip surgeries. MRI can be used to visualize the tender area in the buttocks and help to identify selective piriformis entrapments of the sciatic nerve.\n",

      "Facet (zygapophyseal) joints (Figure 3.5) are synovial-lined, cartilage-surfaced diarthrodial joints that are connected by a ligamentous joint capsule. Facet joint malalignments and associated degenerative osteoarthritic changes (Figure 3.6) are commonly noted radiographically with or without, and before and after, any accompanying low back pain disorders. This does not preclude an abnormal facet joint being a causal factor of a low back pain syndrome. This can be confirmed by a selective joint injection of hypertonic saline under fluoroscopic visualization to attempt to reproduce the pain, followed by a local anesthetic injection to provide specific relief of the induced pain. The facet joint pain referral pattern thus elicited may not be limited to the lumbar region, and may radiate into the buttock and/or down the leg, mimicking a sciatic nerve root pain (facet syndrome). Osteoarthritic vertebral and facet joint osteophytes, plus facet malalignments and discal protrusions (see Figure 3.2b), can all predispose to and contribute to a nerve root impingement and radicular symptoms. Occasionally, a synovial cyst may protrude from an arthritic facet joint and cause compression of an adjacent nerve root.\n",

Essentially, M0-M5 describe stages of myeloid maturation; M6 and M7 describe erythroid leukemia and megakaryocytic leukemia, respectively. The FAB classification has been superseded by the WHO classification (Table 2.3) and the ELN risk stratification (Table 2.4), which include highly relevant cytogenetic and genetic aberrations.

In the near future, these somewhat restrictive determinants of treatment will be supplemented with more predictive factors such as BRCA status or tumor histology, and by gene- or pathway-based assessments that facilitate individualized therapy.

This metabolism can alter the menstrual cycle and increase turnover of the components of oral contraceptive pills and depot formulations of steroid hormones (Table 8.1). The risk of breakthrough pregnancy is not insignificant. An oral contraceptive formulation containing 50 µg of estrogen, with subsequent adjustment depending on the presence or absence of breakthrough bleeding, can provide secure contraception, as can barrier methods. Other birth control measures must be taken until the pattern of menstruation has been stable for at least 3 months. Lamotrigine (LTG) reduces levonorgestrel levels by about 20%, which is a potentially significant decrease. Levonorgestrel implants are contraindicated in women taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as they have an unacceptably high failure rate. This is also likely to be the case with the progesterone-only pill. Medroxyprogesterone injections appear to be effective, though they need to be given more frequently than is usually recommended.

AED doses may, therefore, need to be reduced as a child grows older. However, such a rise is often offset by a teenage growth spurt. Falling AED levels may indicate imperfect compliance, a common occurrence in this age group. The teenage years are an appropriate time for counseling on contraception, clarifying the possible side effects of AEDs, and predicting prognosis and eventual drug withdrawal. Driving, social interactions and career advice are other issues that doctors caring for teenagers with epilepsy must address (see Chapter 9).\n",

The home assessment should include. description of the episodes. evaluation of IQ. details of concomitant medication. previous and current AED treatment. circulating AED levels if appropriate. details of the carer's concerns and so on. Home video recordings can help to confirm or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy. At the outset, a management plan, including outcome aims, should be formulated with the full involvement of the carer(s) and family. Numbers and doses of AEDs should be minimized as much as possible. Attention should be paid not only to seizure frequency and severity, but also to behavior, mood, appetite, communication, cooperation, alertness and sleep pattern. Broad-spectrum AEDs, such as VPA, LTG, TPM, zonisamide and LEV, should be the preferred choice, and barbiturates and benzodiazepines should be avoided. The endpoint need not always be freedom from seizures, but perhaps better control accompanied by improved alertness, mood and cooperation.\n",

      "Stress (or effort-related) incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine during physical exertion. This occurs without any contraction of the detrusor and may be associated with a number of physical activities, including laughing, coughing, sneezing, running, jumping, aerobics and sexual activity. Urine loss is usually in small amounts (drops, squirts) and may not be a daily event. It is caused by failure of the bladder outlet to remain closed and thereby maintain continence when intra-abdominal pressure is raised. Urgency (previously called urge) incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine accompanied, or immediately preceded, by urgency. Urgency incontinence can take the form of frequent small losses between voids or large urine losses from sudden complete bladder emptying. It can occur several times a day or week. It is caused by involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling/urine storage. Nocturnal enuresis is the loss of urine during sleep. When taking a history, it is important to inquire about childhood nocturnal enuresis (bed-wetting), as delayed bladder control in childhood is often associated with detrusor overactivity in adulthood.\n",

      "Huntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes loss of cognitive functions, involuntary movements and emotional instabilities. The underlying genetic problem is the extension of a CAG trinucleotide repeat located in the HTT gene, encoding the huntingtin protein. While the CAG segment is normally repeated 10 to 35 times within the HTT gene, people with 40 or more repeats nearly always develop disease. Huntington's disease usually appears in people in their thirties or forties. The increased size of the CAG segment leads to the synthesis of an abnormally elongated huntingtin protein, which is broken down into smaller toxic fragments that aggregate and accumulate in neurons, thereby disrupting normal cell function and eventually leading to death of neurons. Hope for treatment of this disease comes from preclinical studies using AAV vectors that express not a therapeutic protein but a micro (mi)RNA that targets the HTT messenger (m)RNA and induces its degradation (the miRNA machinery of post-transcriptional regulation has evolved to specifically eliminate unwanted gene expression in a given cell type) (Figure 6.1). For example, an AAV5-miHTT vector was able to decrease production of the huntingtin protein by more than 50% in areas of gene transfer in the brains of minipigs that had been injected with the vector. Intracranial injections led to dose-dependent vector distribution to the striatum, putamen and spreading to the cerebral cortex. These areas are affected by neuropathological changes at different stages of the disease.\n",

The accumulation of glycogen affects functions of multiple tissues. Children with GSDIa may have thin arms and legs, short stature and suffer from enlarged livers and kidneys. The hypoglycemia that results from the disease can be life-threatening. If chronically untreated, severe lactic acidosis, progression to renal failure and even death may occur in infancy or childhood. While there are no pharmacological therapies, consumption of sugar-free foods and drinks and regular intake of uncooked cornstarch, combined with other dietary adjustments, is helpful, particularly in milder forms of the disease. An investigational gene therapy is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial, based on systemic delivery of an AAV8 vector with hopes of achieving stable expression and activity of G6Pase-alpha under control of its native gene promoter. In preclinical studies, this gene therapy was particularly effective in reducing hepatic glycogen levels. Clinical efficacy measures include time to hypoglycemia during a controlled in-hospital fasting challenge, glycogen storage in liver (as determined by MRI) and changes in biomarkers such as lipids and uric acid. It has been reported that 'two of three patients in the first dose cohort experienced a sufficient increase in time to hypoglycemia such that they may be able to sleep through the night without taking supplemental cornstarch'.

These can be engineered in such a way that the packaging capacity of the vector is not exceeded. Using these constructs, dystrophin transgene expression in muscle fibers of patients has already been demonstrated following local intramuscular administration of vector. Furthermore, AAV capsids (such as AAV9 or AAVrh10) have been identified that are capable of infecting muscles throughout the body following high-dose intravascular administration. Intravascular delivery of AAV vectors expressing microdystrophins significantly ameliorated muscle pathology, increased muscle force and attenuated dystrophic cardiomyopathy in various small and large animal models such as dystrophic mice and dogs. Multiple competing Phase I/II clinical trials have now been initiated to test this approach in patients with DMD (Figure 6.2). These utilize AAV9 or AAVrh74 and muscle-specific promoters. Given the very large vector doses that are required (> 10 vector genomes/kg), there are some concerns for toxicities and immune responses. For instance, dystrophic muscles may be inflamed, and T-cell responses against therapeutic dystrophin have been observed in some patients in prior clinical studies. While steroids are given to limit inflammation, incidents of complement activation have also been reported. Still, the field is cautiously optimistic that these problems can be solved and that a lasting therapeutic effect can be accomplished in this challenging disease.\n",

The chance of remission is highest with the first drug - 60% of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve seizure control with the first or second AED. Substantial attention should therefore be given to choosing the most appropriate initial AED, taking into account a range of factors, including the seizure type(s) and/or epilepsy syndrome. Other relevant issues include age, sex, weight, psychiatric and other comorbidities, childbearing potential and concomitant medication.\n",

      "Titration and monitoring. Approximately 50% of newly diagnosed patients will be able to tolerate and become seizure free with the first AED, often in low or moderate doses. In general, the AED should be started at a low dose, with increments over a number of weeks to establish an effective and tolerable regimen, although some agents, such as sodium valproate (VPA) and levetiracetam (LEV), can be commenced at effective doses with, or even without, a rapid titration phase. Slow titration will help avoid concentration-dependent side effects as with carbamazepine (CBZ) or topiramate (TPM), in particular central nervous system toxicity, the presence of which is likely to discourage the patient from persevering with therapy in the long term. An additional benefit of a cautious approach is that it allows the development of tolerance to sedation or cognitive impairment. Such a policy will also ensure early detection of potentially serious idiosyncratic reactions, such as rash, hepatotoxicity and blood dyscrasias (see Side effects). Slow titration with lamotrigine (LTG) has been shown to reduce the risk of skin rash.\n",

Not only are persons with psychiatric disorders more likely to smoke, but they are also likely to smoke more heavily than others. It has yet to be established why these links exist: whether smoking causes or exacerbates these conditions, whether a disorder makes it more likely that a patient will smoke and be unable to stop, or whether there is a common underlying cause.\n",

      "Not all of the decrease in consumption involves smokers giving up altogether; in some cases smokers merely reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke. The health benefits of this action may be undermined, however, because smokers tend to smoke each cigarette more intensively. It is also not fully known how reductions in consumption translate into health benefits. Nevertheless, it is clear that increasing the cost of smoking is, potentially, an important public health measure. Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence. The size of the effect is related to the intensity of the campaign (as indexed by viewing numbers) and whether it is sustained. Specific quitting events, for example the UK's 'No Smoking Day' and 'Stoptober' (a mass quitting event that challenges smokers to be smoke-free for a month as a stepping stone to permanent cessation), and the US 'Great American Smokeout' (which encourages quitting for a day), have been evaluated as a highly cost-effective way of promoting smoking cessation. Bans on tobacco advertising. Tobacco companies spend many billions of dollars annually promoting their brands. In many countries, including the USA, tobacco advertising is banned from television but is permitted in print media. Where there have been more comprehensive bans on promotion, there has been some evidence of an effect in reducing smoking. For this reason, and because of moral concerns over permitting promotion of a product that is addictive and often lethal when used as intended, several countries, including those in the European Union, have implemented a total ban on tobacco promotion. An international treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (see Chapter 8) mandates this and other tobacco control measures.\n",

      "Genetic factors. The current state of the genetics of eating disorders is that while there is familial clustering of these syndromes, it is not at all clear that they are in their entirety genetically transmitted disorders. Whatever the genetic component to each one of them, it seems to be stronger for anorexia than bulimia. And granting even that, the current literature supports a polygenetic transmission of risk which needs substantial accumulation of environmental risk to have disorders come to the fore. The most potent risk factor for eating disorders is female gender (see Chapter 2). This association is likely to reflect biological as well as psychosocial factors. Family studies indicate that first-degree relatives of patients with anorexia have an increased prevalence of eating disorders (Table 3.1), and that first-degree relatives of patients with bulimia or binge-eating disorder appear to be at increased risk of eating disorders, mood disorders and substance abuse. Twin studies of anorexia and bulimia suggest there is approximately a 50-80% genetic contribution to liability accounted for by additive genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have initially focused on the serotonergic and other neurotransmitter system genes involved in bodyweight regulation, with hardly any unequivocally confirmed findings. Systematic genome-wide linkage scans based on families with at least two individuals with an eating disorder revealed initial linkage regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 4 (anorexia) and 10p (bulimia). Ongoing international collaborations are working at pooling cases and using newer forms of analysis such as genome-wide associations. Similar to other complex disorders, the eating disorders are likely to have a polygenic etiology, each gene having a relatively small effect. Physiological factors. Both high and low premorbid body mass index (BMI) may predispose to anorexia. Being overweight or obese (with a high BMI) is a risk factor because of the likelihood of dieting, while low BMI may characterize individuals who are already prodromally ill with anorexia but who have not yet reached the weight criteria for definitive diagnosis.\n",

Individuals may describe food 'getting stuck' between the gums and the cheeks, especially with food that has a crumbly or leafy texture. LMN dysfunction of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing often results in coughing or choking, especially with thin liquids; swallowing may feel effortful or individuals may report 'food sticking'. Weakness of lip closure together with reduced swallowing frequency may result in sialorrhea (drooling). In upper motor neuron (cortico)bulbar disease, speech becomes strained and slow (Case report 3.2). Swallowing symptoms may be similar to those reported in LMN-predominant bulbar disease, with impaired coordination of pharyngeal muscle contraction. As a result, the individual may lose the automatic ability to coordinate swallowing or coughing in response to laryngeal stimulation, with explosive, though normally transient, choking as a result. More specific UMN symptoms include frequent gagging due to hypersensitivity of the gag response, and laryngospasm. Laryngospasms are brief, often painful, episodes of abrupt 'tightening' or 'squeezing' felt inside the throat, which impair inhalation and speech. They may be triggered by cold air, food particles or saliva. A less obvious but frequently encountered UMN bulbar symptom is pseudobulbar affect (PBA). This is an exaggerated emotional response, also known as emotional lability (see Case report 3.2). The individual may report inappropriate or incongruent episodes of crying or laughing that are easily triggered, difficult to control and disproportionate to how they are feeling. The episodes are often embarrassing and may be mistaken by others for depression or cognitive impairment. Excessive yawning is a frequently concurrent symptom. Depression occurs surprisingly infrequently in ALS but is distinct from PBA, though both may respond to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.\n",

In upper motor neuron (cortico)bulbar disease, speech becomes strained and slow (Case report 3.2). Swallowing symptoms may be similar to those reported in LMN-predominant bulbar disease, with impaired coordination of pharyngeal muscle contraction. As a result, the individual may lose the automatic ability to coordinate swallowing or coughing in response to laryngeal stimulation, with explosive, though normally transient, choking as a result. More specific UMN symptoms include frequent gagging due to hypersensitivity of the gag response, and laryngospasm. Laryngospasms are brief, often painful, episodes of abrupt 'tightening' or 'squeezing' felt inside the throat, which impair inhalation and speech. They may be triggered by cold air, food particles or saliva.\n",

The precedent pathophysiological events are characterized by varying degrees of metabolic derangement, which often differ in degrees between individuals.

More frequently, increased circulating fatty acids (from nutrient excess or obesity) can interfere with insulin signaling through a mechanism termed lipotoxicity. In addition, low-grade systemic inflammation is often found in obesity; disturbed adipose tissue secretion of molecules called adipokines (such as adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha], interleukin-6) can contribute to this.

This results in a rising fasting glucose: as the insulin secretory capacity diminishes, fasting glucose rises further (Figure 4.2). Insulin secretion is further hindered by rising glucose levels which directly damage beta cells through a mechanism called glucotoxicity. Lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes is found in the muscle cells, where glucose is the major substrate. However, it has also been reported in the pancreas, where the effects of excess lipid can contribute to damage to insulin-secreting beta cells. Thus, in the situation of nutrient excess and obesity, where there are excess amounts of circulating fatty acids, lipotoxicity can increase insulin resistance (and the demand for insulin) and diminish the ability to respond by worsening beta cell impairment (see Figure 4.2).\n",

      "How cancer immunotherapy works. In the context of cancer, the term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic targets. The history of immuno-oncology. The concept of immuno-oncology dates back more than 100 years, to 1893 (Figure 3.1). In that year, William Coley, an American surgeon and cancer researcher, observed remission of cancer in patients with postoperative bacterial infections, and suggested that activation of the immune system must play a role in combating cancer., Subsequently, in 1909, Paul Ehrlich suggested that the immune system must play an important role in preventing the development of cancer. However, it was not until the mid-20th century when Lewis Thomas and Frank MacFarlane Burnet hypothesized that the immune system is capable of eliminating cancerous cells through a process known as immune surveillance, and that this process depends on recognition of tumor-associated antigens by the immune system., Subsequently, through the laboratory work of Lloyd Old and Robert Schreiber, the concept of immune surveillance has evolved into 'immunoediting', reflecting the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. Increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of immunoediting has identified numerous potential therapeutic targets, some of which - notably immune checkpoint inhibition as first demonstrated by James Allison in the 1990s - are already yielding promising results in clinical practice., Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science.\n",

      "What types of tumor are potentially susceptible to immuno-oncology?. Clearly, the potential sensitivity of a given cancer to immuno-oncology therapies will depend on the ability of the tumor to trigger an immune response (immunogenicity). Cancer is characterized by an accumulation of genetic mutations, many of which result in the expression of cancer-specific antigens that can bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the cancer cell surface. These antigen-MHC complexes can be recognized by cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes, that, if activated, could potentially mount an immune response against the tumor. As a result, tumors with high somatic mutation rates may be more susceptible to immuno-oncology therapies than those with lower mutation rates. Somatic mutation rates differ markedly, both between tumor types and within an individual tumor type: the rate may vary more than 1000-fold between tumors with the highest and lowest rates (Figure 3.2). The highest rates are seen in cancers of the skin, lung, bladder and stomach, while the lowest are seen in hematologic and pediatric cancers. It is noteworthy that the highest rates occur in tumors that are induced by carcinogens such as tobacco smoke or ultraviolet light.\n",

A variety of cancer immunotherapy strategies are currently being investigated, or have already entered clinical practice. These are conventionally classified as passive or active immunotherapies, according to their ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells (Table 3.1), although this classification does not adequately reflect the complexity of drug-host-tumor interactions. As a result, it has been suggested that immunotherapies should be classified according to their antigen specificity; however, even therapies initially directed against a single antigen may eventually become responsive to multiple antigens, a phenomenon known as epitope spreading. Passive immunotherapies. Tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically target malignant cells are among the best characterized forms of cancer immunotherapy.\n",

      "Assessing the benefits and risks of immunotherapy in cancer. Assessment of the benefits and risks of cancer immunotherapies can be challenging, as the criteria used for conventional therapies cannot generally be extrapolated to immunotherapies. Assessing efficacy. A key issue in immuno-oncology is that patients may show a survival benefit in the absence of an objective response as defined by conventional RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Response to immunotherapies may vary markedly between patients: while some patients may show an initial response or stable disease, in others the response may be delayed because of the need to restore T-cell responses - a process that requires the interaction of numerous other immune cells. Indeed, in some patients, there is an initial phase of pseudoprogression during which the tumor appears to enlarge due to infiltration of newly reactivated T cells and subsequent inflammation. For these reasons, a set of immune-related response criteria (irRC) have been proposed (Table 3.6), relating to four patterns of response.\n",

      "Assessing safety and tolerability. Some immunotherapies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, are associated with immune-related adverse events such as fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and altered liver or kidney function (Figure 3.4). Many of these resemble the adverse events often seen with conventional chemotherapy but have different etiologies: while adverse events with conventional chemotherapy usually reflect cytotoxic effects on healthy tissue, adverse events with immunotherapies typically reflect actions on the immune system. For example, diarrhea associated with immunotherapy may be due to a reaction to gut-associated or self-antigens. Such adverse events require careful management, because although most are mild or moderate in severity, failure to recognize them as immune related could lead to suboptimal management, with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. For example, if untreated, diarrhea from immune-related colitis may become self-perpetuating, potentially leading to gut perforation. Patient education about such adverse events is essential: patients should be warned not to ignore 'slight' or 'mild' symptoms, but to seek medical advice as soon as possible. A multidisciplinary approach, involving oncologists, organ specialists and intensive care physicians, is essential for patients with severe immune-related adverse events.\n",

      "As described in Chapter 3, the risk of thrombosis in ET is assessed on the basis of age and previous history of thrombosis. Thus, a patient below the age of 60 years with no previous history of thrombosis would be considered at low risk of vascular complications, whereas an older patient or one with previous thrombosis is considered to be at high risk. Similarly, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations are associated with a higher risk of thrombosis than are calreticulin (CALR) mutations, and may therefore be considered an additional risk factor for thrombosis in patients with ET (Figure 4.2), although this has yet to be fully incorporated into clinical practice. The choice of treatment depends on the patient's risk level. In general, patients at the lowest level of risk defined by the International Prognostic Score for Essential Thrombocythemia (IPSET) scoring system (Table 3.6, page 38) - younger patients without JAK2 mutations, no cardiovascular risk factors and no history of thrombosis - can often be managed by observation only, and they may not require aspirin (yet to be validated in clinical practice).

Although the blood-brain barrier is focally disrupted, water-soluble chemotherapy may not penetrate sufficiently to reach a therapeutic concentration. In spite of this, chemotherapy may be useful in treating some individuals with brain metastases. Newly diagnosed patients who are chemotherapy naïve and neurologically asymptomatic may respond favorably to systemic chemotherapy. They should be followed closely with serial MRI and neurological examinations to monitor their response to treatment. In particular, patients with brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer or choriocarcinoma may have a better than average response to chemotherapy.\n",

      "'Depression', or 'clinical depression', refers to a mood disorder that ranges in severity from mild to severe, in duration from brief to enduring, and in pattern of illness from single to recurrent episodes. Diagnosis is based on the symptom profile and the severity, duration and course of the disorder. It is characterized by low mood and the absence of positive affect (id est loss of interest and enjoyment in everyday activities), together with a range of emotional, cognitive, physical and behavioral features. Clinical depression is a heterogeneous disorder, with some forms having clear biological underpinnings whereas others arise from psychosocial adversity. While classification systems have specified diagnostic criteria, uncertainties remain about the validity of the threshold that differentiates clinical depression from 'normal' unhappiness.\n",

      "Alongside the lack of clear biological characteristics for depression (as well as for a large number of other psychiatric conditions), there is a problem of where to draw the boundary between normal and pathological depression. The distinction between depression and the distress and angst that are part of normal human experience requires a dichotomization of this continuum of symptoms. Rather than being based on 'hard' criteria related to a clear causal mechanism, with associated biological markers, this differentiation is based on clinical characteristics. Although this is problematic, it is useful to bear in mind that this also applies to other common medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and irritable bowel syndrome, where the variation between extensive and disabling symptoms and few and insignificant symptoms are on a continuum. Delineating depression from other mental disorders. In the community, as well as in primary care settings, the most prevalent mood disorder is a combination of depression and anxiety. The overlap between symptoms such as low mood, lack of energy, insomnia, worry and irritability is considerable; for example, in 2014, nearly 8% of the UK household population demonstrated this combination of symptoms to a clinically significant extent, although smaller proportions have sufficient symptoms to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders.

The body has a limited range of compensatory responses to circulatory impairment, mainly vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention (see below).

      "Cardiorenal interactions. Reduced renal perfusion in HF (due to reduced stroke volume and vasoconstriction) is an important contributor to sodium and fluid overload. The exact links between cardiac and renal function have yet to be resolved. More marked disturbances of renal function, leading to coexisting renal failure, may also occur and pose problems for volume control. Clinical stages and functional classes. The clinical syndrome of HF represents the final manifestation of advanced disease. Although progress has been made in the management of this entity, the greatest hope of avoiding the adverse outcome of HF is to intervene at an earlier subclinical stage, when there is more likelihood of reversing the process. The American Cardiology Association (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines divide progression of the disease into four preclinical and clinical stages (Table 2.1). It is important to distinguish these from functional classes, as described in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which is based on severity of symptoms and exercise capacity and can be used to assess response to treatment (see Table 2.1). ACC/AHA stages A and B are preclinical; these patients fall into NYHA functional class I. ACC/AHA stage C reflects patients with symptoms or signs of HF, so these patients may be classified functionally in any of the NYHA classes I to III. The functional status of patients in ACC/AHA class D (with marked symptoms and signs of HF) is usually limited (NYHA class II to IV). The association between functional class, cardiac function (LVEF) and prognosis is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.\n",

      "Reasons to suspect P. acnes resistance are shown in Table 8.4. There are concerns that overuse of antibiotics will drive resistance in other commensal bacteria. Preventing resistance. It is difficult to culture P. acnes and, therefore, some overall guidelines are necessary to help the physician correctly suspect, prevent and treat P. acnes resistance. The emergence of resistance has raised the need for antibiotic prescribing policies and the need to consider the use of non-antibiotic preparations wherever possible. Principles for the optimal use of oral antibiotics are summarized in Table 8.5. Current thinking is that antibiotics should be administered for the shortest duration possible, and that combining them initially with topical retinoids will enhance efficacy. The advised length of treatment is 12 weeks. If longer than 12 weeks is required, anti-resistance agents such as BPO must be used concurrently. Combining non-antibiotic and antibiotic therapies results in more rapid efficacy, and this in turn may reduce the antibiotic exposure time. The same antibiotic should be used again if it previously produced a good clinical response. Antibiotics should not be used in the maintenance phase of therapy. P. acnes resistance should be suspected in patients who are not responding, patients who were responding but have relapsed, and those who have had 2-3 courses of different topical and oral antibiotics. Suspected resistant P. acnes should be targeted with antibiotics for which there is less evidence of resistance; higher rather than lower doses of a topical antibiotic should also be used. Likewise, higher oral doses of therapy may be indicated. Some preparations, such as non-antibiotic antimicrobials, id est BPO and topical retinoids, will never be associated with P. acnes resistance, nor will oral contraceptives or oral isotretinoin.\n",

      "What are real-world data?. Real world is a term that is important to define as it is often misused. The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). These data sources include electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile technologies. Real-world evidence is the evidence derived from real-world data. In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute real-world data. However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial. They do not represent the overall population in a certain indication. Therefore, when working with clinical research, it is important to focus on the benefits of health-related data collected in natural settings - which may not be classified as 'real world' by a strict regulatory definition.\n",

      "NGS testing for predictive biomarkers. EGFR activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (see Chapter 1) plays an important role in oncogenesis in CRC. Up to 50% of CRCs show activating mutations of KRAS. Anti-EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, can be beneficial in patients with metastatic CRC provided that there is no downstream mutation activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Initially, patients with codon 12/13 KRAS mutations did not benefit in clinical trials, and subsequently mutations in other codons of KRAS and in NRAS were also shown to confer resistance to antibody-based therapies., Thus, guidelines require an 'extended' RAS analysis be performed. At present, the minimum testing required to determine whether anti-EGFR therapy may be of benefit is this extended RAS testing of KRAS and NRAS. codons 12 and 13 of exon 2. codons 59 and 61 of exon 3. codons 117 and 146 of exon 4. Wild-type phenotype for KRAS and NRAS is thus an indication for anti-EGFR therapy.\n",

      "Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations documented in all subtypes (Table 5.3)., The KIT mutation is associated with chronic sun damage. The BRAF mutation is present in 11% of patients with mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutation in 5% and KIT mutation in 15-20%. From a molecular point of view, uveal melanoma is a distinct condition characterized, in 50% of patients, by the presence of a GNAQ mutation. The presence of BRAF and NRAS mutations has not been described in uveal melanoma. The serine/threonine kinase BRAF is involved in the downstream signaling of the RTK and RAS proteins. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations (Figure 5.2). In the majority of cases, a valine at position 600 is mutated to glutamic acid or lysine (BRAF p.V600E and BRAF p.V600K); both mutations are associated with kinase activation that results from relieving an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction between the activation segment and P-loop of the protein.\n",

      "BRAF mutations are most common in the nodular and superficial spreading melanoma types, and they are rare in acral lentiginous (5-10% of cases) and non-cutaneous melanomas. BRAF mutation correlates with distinct histopathological features, such as intraepidermal melanoma nest formation and a larger rounder border of the tumor with the surrounding skin, suggesting surrogate markers can be used to select patients for molecular testing. BRAF mutations also arise more commonly in patients who are younger at presentation and those with lymph node metastasis (rather than satellite tumors or visceral metastasis). BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma, though these may be of short duration in some patients. Approximately 20% of patients with mutant BRAF melanoma show no response, and most patients treated with monotherapy relapse, with a median PFS of 8-9 months.\n",

      "The immune system has evolved to protect the host against infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, and to detect and eliminate potentially harmful foreign material. A hallmark of cancer is that tumor cells - which would normally be recognized by the immune system as abnormal - acquire the ability to evade the immune system. Immuno-oncology is a new, multi-faceted and rapidly evolving collection of treatment strategies aimed at harnessing immune processes to target and destroy tumor cells and prolong survival. An understanding of the basic elements of the normal and tumor-altered immune system is therefore key to understanding potential immuno-oncology therapies. The immune system consists of two components: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is conferred by mechanisms that are present throughout life, such as the physical barriers to infection provided by the skin and mucous membranes, white blood cells that remove foreign material, and serum proteins such as lysozymes and kinins.\n",

      "Adaptive (acquired) immunity is conferred by the formation of antibodies following exposure to foreign material (antigens), and is specific to the particular antigen. In general, innate immune reactions provide a rapid (within hours) but non-specific initial response to infection or injury, whereas adaptive immune responses are more specific to the foreign antigen and develop over a longer period (Figure 1.1). Innate immunity. In addition to the physical barrier of skin and membranes, innate immunity is primarily conferred by phagocytic cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. The most important of these include macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils, although other cell types, such as natural killer (NK) cells, also play important roles (Table 1.1).\n",

Recognition of self and non-self. A key step in adaptive immunity is the presentation of antigens to immune cells. All cells present surface antigens that are complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins, allowing the immune system to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self'.

      "Cellular immunity. Surface T cell receptors (TCRs) are specific to individual antigens, and are activated when the TCR binds to the appropriate antigen. The availability of T cells to respond to the wide variety of potential antigens is achieved through extensive random rearrangements in the TCR gene during T-cell development in the thymus. Inevitably, such random rearrangements will occasionally produce TCRs that bind to 'self' antigens; in this situation, the T cells are eliminated or deactivated in a process known as self-tolerance. If this process is incomplete, autoimmune diseases may arise. T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of APCs in association with MHC molecules. CD4+ T cells, which are subdivided into helper (T h) and regulatory (T reg) T cells, recognize antigens bound to MHC class II molecules. Activation of T h cells, which requires a weaker stimulus than for cytotoxic T cells, leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells including APCs. There are two types of CD4+ T cell responses. Th1 responses are primarily directed against intracellular pathogens, and are characterized by production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, induction of opsonization, and antibody production by B cells. Th2 responses are effective against extracellular bacteria and parasites, and are characterized by production of interleukin (IL)-4 and -5. T reg cells mainly regulate and suppress the immune response of naive and effector T cells through a variety of cytokine and signaling mechanisms, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10. T reg cells regulate the immune response to common environmental allergens and prevent the development of atopy or undesirable inflammation. However, their role in maintenance of peripheral tolerance is also used by cancers to evade the immune system. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (also known as killer T cells) are activated by antigens from intracellular pathogens presented on MHC class I molecules. Activation of these cells triggers a process known as clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells (Teff). These cells recognize cells with a unique MHC class I-antigen complex, and release enzymes and toxins that lyse the cell membrane and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). To prevent extensive tissue damage during an infection, activation of CD8+ cells requires three signals (Figure 1.4).\n",

Central tolerance is the principal mechanism by which the immune system learns to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self'.

      "Mechanisms underlying cigarette addiction. There are almost certainly several mechanisms underlying smoking addiction, all involving nicotine in some way. Habit. One likely mechanism involves the development of a powerful 'habit' in which cues associated with smoking trigger an urge to smoke. This occurs because nicotine acts on a part of the brain that learns which responses are useful for survival in different situations. This part of the brain evolved in other species and operates at a level below conscious awareness. Thus, smokers experience urges to smoke when confronted with smoking cues, but these need not stem from any anticipated pleasure from smoking or conscious decision-making process. The facilitation of such compelling associations probably requires nicotine to be delivered rapidly, as from a cigarette, rather than slowly as from, say, the nicotine patch.\n",

These are all withdrawal symptoms resulting from physiological adaptation to repeated nicotine intake. Thus, nicotine does not alleviate these problems in people who do not smoke. Unfortunately, such discomfort can occur for all kinds of reasons, and the smoker's brain is not good at discriminating adverse mood states that arise from nicotine withdrawal from those arising from other causes. This means that smokers learn to associate adverse mood states and difficulty concentrating with smoking, and come to believe that smoking helps them to cope, even though it does so only because they are experiencing the problem because they have not smoked for a while. Unfortunately, as long as they believe that smoking helps to relieve adverse mood and other symptoms, smokers will be at risk of relapse when they try to stop. The sum of motivations. Putting all this together, we can see that there are probably at least three ways in which repeated ultra-rapid intake of nicotine from cigarettes creates powerful motivations to smoke, which undermine and overwhelm the resolve not to. Different smokers probably experience each of these three elements of nicotine dependence to differing degrees. Thus, some smokers clearly have a strong nicotine hunger and smoke as soon as they wake up in the morning and whenever the opportunity arises during the day.

      "After examining a large number of brains, both clinically normal and with Parkinson's disease, Braak et al. suggested that stage 1 of the disease begins at induction sites in the olfactory system and the dorsal vagal nucleus, with degeneration of the olfactory bulb and the anterior olfactory nucleus. This presents clinically as olfactory dysfunction. Stage 2 reflects progression of the pathological process to the nuclei of the caudal brainstem (the locus ceruleus and other nuclei). The lower brainstem nuclei are key areas mediating a myriad of non-motor symptoms such as sleep homeostasis, depression, fatigue, cognitive problems, pain, constipation and a reduction in central autonomic vagal control. Several of these symptoms are now recognized as possible prodromal features of Parkinson's disease. However, clinical Parkinson's disease tends to be recognized by healthcare professionals only when the condition reaches stage 3, which involves the substantia nigra. Stages 4 to 6 represent further pathological progression to the cortex (Figure 2.3).\n",

In order to explain these apparent contradictions it has been hypothesized that the abnormal firing of the globus pallidus interna, rather than overactivity alone, contributes to the motor problems in Parkinson's disease, and pallidotomy works by removing this aberrant pattern of discharge. Latest thinking. It is now widely believed that the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease are not only due to the loss of a single monoamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, but also the effects of widespread Lewy body disease. This results in a convergence of deficits in multiple transmitter pathways, including the cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, which underpin many of the non-motor symptoms that are integral to Parkinson's disease (Figure 2.7).

      "Previously identified genes have been pivotal to understanding the process of neurodegeneration. However, the clinical impact of these gene mutations has been limited because they are usually identified in patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (exempli gratia with PARK2 and PINK1 [also known as PARK6 ]) or with atypical parkinsonism (as with MAPT). In the genome-wide scan for Parkinson's disease (GenePD) study, which investigated the effect of heterozygous PARK2 mutations on age of onset in patients with familial Parkinson's disease, one member from each of 183 families was screened for PARK2 mutations: 12.6% of the families were positive. Of these, 43% were compound heterozygotes, 13% were homozygotes and 10% were heterozygotes. The age of onset of Parkinson's disease was significantly lower in those with one PARK2 mutation than in those with none (11.7 years earlier), and also significantly lower in those with two mutations than in those with one (13.2 years earlier). The study showed that the PARK2 mutation is not rare, and that heterozygosity significantly lowers the age of onset of Parkinson's disease. Clinically, however, it is not possible to distinguish between patients with a Parkin -, PINK1 - and DJ-1 -linked form of Parkinson's disease. Studies in twins have been performed since 1967. Ward et al. studied 43 monozygotic and 19 dizygotic pairs of twins, and found that the concordance rate for parkinsonism was no more frequent in twins than expected, given the general rate of disease. They concluded that the main causative factors are probably not genetic. However, Parkinson's disease may be asymptomatic in the unaffected twin. Burn et al. studied 18-fluorodopa PET scans in sets of twins in which one of each pair had clinical Parkinson's disease. The clinically unaffected twin frequently had abnormally low 18-fluorodopa uptake. Follow-up of some of the twins revealed worsening of this abnormality, suggesting progressive deterioration of nigrostriatal function. The PET findings suggested concordance rates of 45% for monozygotic and 29% for dizygotic twins. Therefore, it seems that some genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease is likely.\n",

      "Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. Although most patients with generalized MG have antibodies to AChR (see below), a minority of patients without AChR antibodies have antibodies to the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK). As discussed in Chapter 1, a higher percentage of patients with treatment-refractory MG have been found to have MuSK antibodies than those who respond to treatment. The disease can be particularly severe in patients with MuSK antibodies (see below). At present it is unclear how MuSK antibodies cause MG, but it is possible that MuSK antibodies alter AChR density or number. MuSK signaling is crucial for the development, long-term maintenance and stabilization of the postsynaptic portion of the NMJ. The antibodies in MuSK MG are largely of the IgG4 subclass and have been demonstrated in vitro to block the assembly and activation of MuSK. In animal models, administration of MuSK antibodies has resulted in reduced postsynaptic AChRs, disturbed synaptic alignment, reduced synaptic potentials and impaired muscle activation.

Of these, 15% are discovered to have thymoma, and the remainder have evidence of lymphoid hyperplasia.

However, when a preoperative tissue diagnosis is required in a potentially resectable pancreatic mass, EUS-guided FNA should be the preferred route on account of the lower potential risk of peritoneal seeding, the shorter needle tract and the inclusion of the needle track in the resection specimen (in pancreatic head tumors). Tissue diagnosis may be needed in borderline resectable pancreatic tumors if the patient is to undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy before surgery.\n",

For the purpose of surgical planning, this usually requires the patient to perform specific tasks (task-based fMRI). Most commonly, fMRI can assess language lateralization or motor cortical activation in relation to the tumor. fMRI is considered less reliable for accurate language localization, because the activation of language regions is complex, multifocal and not comprehensively explored by basic fMRI tasks. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) builds on standard diffusion-weighted imaging (see page 36) by including additional (a minimum of six) diffusion directions. These multidirectional data enable both the volume and the directionality of diffusion to be calculated. DTI tractography provides an approximation of the relations between the most eloquent white matter tracts and the tumor. Distances are usually expressed as estimates rather than exact (exempli gratia millimeter) measurements, because the depiction of white matter fibers can vary depending on the segmentation technique and threshold settings.

Postoperative radiotherapy alone was standard treatment until it was demonstrated that external beam radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy was more effective than radiotherapy alone (see below). This treatment is not usually administered until about 4 weeks after surgery when the craniotomy wound has healed. Three-dimensional conformal beam or intensity-modulated radiotherapy is then delivered as 60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Doses above this are associated with increased toxicity with no additional survival benefit. Chemotherapy. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine-derived alkylating agent that is 100% bioavailable when taken orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 hour. Because of its small size and lipophilic properties, it can cross the blood-brain barrier. Temozolomide is administered orally at 75 mg/m daily during radiotherapy. After a duration of approximately 1 month, this is followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 150-200 mg/m on days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle. Temozolomide acts by preventing DNA replication through alkyl group-mediated crosslinking of DNA. Clinical data. The standard of care described above is based on the results of the 2005 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26981-22981/National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group CE3 randomized Phase III trial of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiotherapy alone in 573 patients with glioblastoma.

In 2019, Hegi and colleagues reported a study that examined the optimal cut-off for definition of MGMT methylation based on four randomized trials involving 1725 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who received standard radiotherapy and temozolomide. A cut-off of greater than 1.27 was identified as high MGMT methylation that would render a tumor more sensitive to temozolomide. The cut-off for 'truly unmethylated' tumors was -0.28 or lower; approximately 10% of tumors were in the 'gray zone' (< −0.28, <= 1.27). The authors concluded that low MGMT methylation status within the 'gray zone' may confer some sensitivity to temozolomide therapy and recommended that the lower safety margin should be used to select patients with unmethylated tumors for inclusion in trials that do not include temozolomide.

In contrast to localized or locally advanced disease, metastatic prostate cancer is associated with high mortality - approximately 70% within 5 years. Androgen deprivation, which has become the mainstay of treatment, effectively reduces the intratumoral dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration by 70-80%, reducing stimulation of androgen receptors and increasing apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (Table 7.1).

      "It has been suggested that continuous androgen ablation therapy may, in fact, increase the rate of progression of prostate cancer to a castrate-resistant state (see Chapter 8), prompting the exploration of the use of intermittent hormonal therapy, which also has the potential advantage of decreasing the side effects of therapy. In this approach, hormone therapy is initially given for 6-9 months. If PSA levels become normalized, the LHRH analog/antagonist is temporarily discontinued. Hormone therapy is resumed when serum PSA returns to pretreatment levels in those with a PSA below 20 ng/mL at diagnosis, or when PSA exceeds 20 ng/mL in patients with an initial PSA above this. Such a regimen allows serum testosterone to return to normal, thereby stimulating atrophic cells and rendering them more sensitive to androgen ablation (Figure 7.4). The use of a pure LHRH antagonist, which blocks the receptor without initial stimulation (see page 89), could be advantageous in this setting given the absence of flare and, potentially, a more rapid restoration of testosterone level after cessation of therapy.\n",

Precise identification of the injured tissue, and the role of that injury in the consequent pain and dysfunction, can be frustratingly difficult.

      "The gluteal and piriformis muscles are shown in Figure 3.1. The primary functions of the gluteal muscles are to support, stabilize and mobilize the hips and lower extremities in relation to the pelvis and the trunk. Possibly the most common manifestation of lumbar and lumbosacral pain referral is to the mid-portion of the gluteal muscles (buttocks) that overlie the piriformis muscle. This is accompanied by a palpable localized region of deep, tender muscle induration. Because of the thickness of the overlying gluteus maximus muscle, the fibers of which are parallel to (and indistinguishable from) the piriformis muscle fibers, it is not possible to determine by palpation if the piriformis muscle per se is the source of the localized muscle tenderness. A 'piriformis syndrome' is therefore somewhat problematic to identify and must be carefully distinguished from the more common, spinal discogenic basis for sciatic radiculopathy. A piriformis syndrome may result from scarring after a fall on the buttocks or as a consequence of pelvic or hip surgeries. MRI can be used to visualize the tender area in the buttocks and help to identify selective piriformis entrapments of the sciatic nerve.\n",

      "Facet (zygapophyseal) joints (Figure 3.5) are synovial-lined, cartilage-surfaced diarthrodial joints that are connected by a ligamentous joint capsule. Facet joint malalignments and associated degenerative osteoarthritic changes (Figure 3.6) are commonly noted radiographically with or without, and before and after, any accompanying low back pain disorders. This does not preclude an abnormal facet joint being a causal factor of a low back pain syndrome. This can be confirmed by a selective joint injection of hypertonic saline under fluoroscopic visualization to attempt to reproduce the pain, followed by a local anesthetic injection to provide specific relief of the induced pain. The facet joint pain referral pattern thus elicited may not be limited to the lumbar region, and may radiate into the buttock and/or down the leg, mimicking a sciatic nerve root pain (facet syndrome). Osteoarthritic vertebral and facet joint osteophytes, plus facet malalignments and discal protrusions (see Figure 3.2b), can all predispose to and contribute to a nerve root impingement and radicular symptoms. Occasionally, a synovial cyst may protrude from an arthritic facet joint and cause compression of an adjacent nerve root.\n",

Traditionally, the choice of treatment has been determined by the time that has elapsed since the last platinum-based chemotherapy: in practice, however, the treatment-free interval, irrespective of last platinum dose, may be even more valuable. In the near future, these somewhat restrictive determinants of treatment will be supplemented with more predictive factors such as BRCA status or tumor histology, and by gene- or pathway-based assessments that facilitate individualized therapy.

The risk of breakthrough pregnancy is not insignificant. An oral contraceptive formulation containing 50 µg of estrogen, with subsequent adjustment depending on the presence or absence of breakthrough bleeding, can provide secure contraception, as can barrier methods. Other birth control measures must be taken until the pattern of menstruation has been stable for at least 3 months. Lamotrigine (LTG) reduces levonorgestrel levels by about 20%, which is a potentially significant decrease. Levonorgestrel implants are contraindicated in women taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as they have an unacceptably high failure rate. This is also likely to be the case with the progesterone-only pill. Medroxyprogesterone injections appear to be effective, though they need to be given more frequently than is usually recommended. The morning-after contraceptive pill can be used after unprotected intercourse.

      "Stress (or effort-related) incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine during physical exertion. This occurs without any contraction of the detrusor and may be associated with a number of physical activities, including laughing, coughing, sneezing, running, jumping, aerobics and sexual activity. Urine loss is usually in small amounts (drops, squirts) and may not be a daily event. It is caused by failure of the bladder outlet to remain closed and thereby maintain continence when intra-abdominal pressure is raised. Urgency (previously called urge) incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine accompanied, or immediately preceded, by urgency. Urgency incontinence can take the form of frequent small losses between voids or large urine losses from sudden complete bladder emptying. It can occur several times a day or week. It is caused by involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling/urine storage. Nocturnal enuresis is the loss of urine during sleep. When taking a history, it is important to inquire about childhood nocturnal enuresis (bed-wetting), as delayed bladder control in childhood is often associated with detrusor overactivity in adulthood.\n",

      "Huntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes loss of cognitive functions, involuntary movements and emotional instabilities. The underlying genetic problem is the extension of a CAG trinucleotide repeat located in the HTT gene, encoding the huntingtin protein. While the CAG segment is normally repeated 10 to 35 times within the HTT gene, people with 40 or more repeats nearly always develop disease. Huntington's disease usually appears in people in their thirties or forties. The increased size of the CAG segment leads to the synthesis of an abnormally elongated huntingtin protein, which is broken down into smaller toxic fragments that aggregate and accumulate in neurons, thereby disrupting normal cell function and eventually leading to death of neurons. Hope for treatment of this disease comes from preclinical studies using AAV vectors that express not a therapeutic protein but a micro (mi)RNA that targets the HTT messenger (m)RNA and induces its degradation (the miRNA machinery of post-transcriptional regulation has evolved to specifically eliminate unwanted gene expression in a given cell type) (Figure 6.1). For example, an AAV5-miHTT vector was able to decrease production of the huntingtin protein by more than 50% in areas of gene transfer in the brains of minipigs that had been injected with the vector. Intracranial injections led to dose-dependent vector distribution to the striatum, putamen and spreading to the cerebral cortex. These areas are affected by neuropathological changes at different stages of the disease.\n",

The accumulation of glycogen affects functions of multiple tissues. Children with GSDIa may have thin arms and legs, short stature and suffer from enlarged livers and kidneys. The hypoglycemia that results from the disease can be life-threatening. If chronically untreated, severe lactic acidosis, progression to renal failure and even death may occur in infancy or childhood. While there are no pharmacological therapies, consumption of sugar-free foods and drinks and regular intake of uncooked cornstarch, combined with other dietary adjustments, is helpful, particularly in milder forms of the disease. An investigational gene therapy is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial, based on systemic delivery of an AAV8 vector with hopes of achieving stable expression and activity of G6Pase-alpha under control of its native gene promoter. In preclinical studies, this gene therapy was particularly effective in reducing hepatic glycogen levels. Clinical efficacy measures include time to hypoglycemia during a controlled in-hospital fasting challenge, glycogen storage in liver (as determined by MRI) and changes in biomarkers such as lipids and uric acid. It has been reported that 'two of three patients in the first dose cohort experienced a sufficient increase in time to hypoglycemia such that they may be able to sleep through the night without taking supplemental cornstarch'.

These can be engineered in such a way that the packaging capacity of the vector is not exceeded. Using these constructs, dystrophin transgene expression in muscle fibers of patients has already been demonstrated following local intramuscular administration of vector. Furthermore, AAV capsids (such as AAV9 or AAVrh10) have been identified that are capable of infecting muscles throughout the body following high-dose intravascular administration. Intravascular delivery of AAV vectors expressing microdystrophins significantly ameliorated muscle pathology, increased muscle force and attenuated dystrophic cardiomyopathy in various small and large animal models such as dystrophic mice and dogs. Multiple competing Phase I/II clinical trials have now been initiated to test this approach in patients with DMD (Figure 6.2). These utilize AAV9 or AAVrh74 and muscle-specific promoters. Given the very large vector doses that are required (> 10 vector genomes/kg), there are some concerns for toxicities and immune responses. For instance, dystrophic muscles may be inflamed, and T-cell responses against therapeutic dystrophin have been observed in some patients in prior clinical studies. While steroids are given to limit inflammation, incidents of complement activation have also been reported. Still, the field is cautiously optimistic that these problems can be solved and that a lasting therapeutic effect can be accomplished in this challenging disease.\n",

In general, the AED should be started at a low dose, with increments over a number of weeks to establish an effective and tolerable regimen, although some agents, such as sodium valproate (VPA) and levetiracetam (LEV), can be commenced at effective doses with, or even without, a rapid titration phase. Slow titration will help avoid concentration-dependent side effects as with carbamazepine (CBZ) or topiramate (TPM), in particular central nervous system toxicity, the presence of which is likely to discourage the patient from persevering with therapy in the long term. An additional benefit of a cautious approach is that it allows the development of tolerance to sedation or cognitive impairment. Such a policy will also ensure early detection of potentially serious idiosyncratic reactions, such as rash, hepatotoxicity and blood dyscrasias (see Side effects). Slow titration with lamotrigine (LTG) has been shown to reduce the risk of skin rash.\n",

The size of the effect is related to the intensity of the campaign (as indexed by viewing numbers) and whether it is sustained. Specific quitting events, for example the UK's 'No Smoking Day' and 'Stoptober' (a mass quitting event that challenges smokers to be smoke-free for a month as a stepping stone to permanent cessation), and the US 'Great American Smokeout' (which encourages quitting for a day), have been evaluated as a highly cost-effective way of promoting smoking cessation. Bans on tobacco advertising. Tobacco companies spend many billions of dollars annually promoting their brands. In many countries, including the USA, tobacco advertising is banned from television but is permitted in print media. Where there have been more comprehensive bans on promotion, there has been some evidence of an effect in reducing smoking. For this reason, and because of moral concerns over permitting promotion of a product that is addictive and often lethal when used as intended, several countries, including those in the European Union, have implemented a total ban on tobacco promotion. An international treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (see Chapter 8) mandates this and other tobacco control measures.\n",

      "Genetic factors. The current state of the genetics of eating disorders is that while there is familial clustering of these syndromes, it is not at all clear that they are in their entirety genetically transmitted disorders. Whatever the genetic component to each one of them, it seems to be stronger for anorexia than bulimia. And granting even that, the current literature supports a polygenetic transmission of risk which needs substantial accumulation of environmental risk to have disorders come to the fore. The most potent risk factor for eating disorders is female gender (see Chapter 2). This association is likely to reflect biological as well as psychosocial factors. Family studies indicate that first-degree relatives of patients with anorexia have an increased prevalence of eating disorders (Table 3.1), and that first-degree relatives of patients with bulimia or binge-eating disorder appear to be at increased risk of eating disorders, mood disorders and substance abuse. Twin studies of anorexia and bulimia suggest there is approximately a 50-80% genetic contribution to liability accounted for by additive genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have initially focused on the serotonergic and other neurotransmitter system genes involved in bodyweight regulation, with hardly any unequivocally confirmed findings. Systematic genome-wide linkage scans based on families with at least two individuals with an eating disorder revealed initial linkage regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 4 (anorexia) and 10p (bulimia). Ongoing international collaborations are working at pooling cases and using newer forms of analysis such as genome-wide associations. Similar to other complex disorders, the eating disorders are likely to have a polygenic etiology, each gene having a relatively small effect. Physiological factors. Both high and low premorbid body mass index (BMI) may predispose to anorexia. Being overweight or obese (with a high BMI) is a risk factor because of the likelihood of dieting, while low BMI may characterize individuals who are already prodromally ill with anorexia but who have not yet reached the weight criteria for definitive diagnosis.\n",

Several psychological and biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the comorbidity of eating disorders and substance abuse. Psychological factors include the hypothesis of an addictive personality that predisposes individuals to becoming addicted to substances, viewing food and drugs as functional equivalents. Another explanation, which has received empirical support, is that the initial development of an addiction fosters psychological and behavioral patterns that enable individuals to develop other addictions. Another mechanism is the self-medication hypothesis, which states that individuals with an eating disorder turn to alcohol and drugs in order to cope with, or treat, their eating problems.

The precedent pathophysiological events are characterized by varying degrees of metabolic derangement, which often differ in degrees between individuals. The keys are insulin resistance in muscle (thereby increasing insulin demand), insulin resistance in liver (thereby increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis) and eventual beta cell failure with relative insulin deficiency (that is, unable to meet insulin demand). While there is relative insulin deficiency in type 2 diabetes, it is rarely absolute deficiency as in type 1 diabetes, thus ketoacidosis does not occur with hyperglycemia.

More frequently, increased circulating fatty acids (from nutrient excess or obesity) can interfere with insulin signaling through a mechanism termed lipotoxicity. In addition, low-grade systemic inflammation is often found in obesity; disturbed adipose tissue secretion of molecules called adipokines (such as adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFalpha], interleukin-6) can contribute to this. Adipokines can interfere with insulin action through a number of specific pathways involving intracellular inflammation signal transduction pathways that link in to insulin signaling pathways.

      "Insulin resistance is also found in the liver. With failing insulin secretion, there is insufficient insulin to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis, particularly overnight. This results in a rising fasting glucose: as the insulin secretory capacity diminishes, fasting glucose rises further (Figure 4.2). Insulin secretion is further hindered by rising glucose levels which directly damage beta cells through a mechanism called glucotoxicity. Lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes is found in the muscle cells, where glucose is the major substrate. However, it has also been reported in the pancreas, where the effects of excess lipid can contribute to damage to insulin-secreting beta cells. Thus, in the situation of nutrient excess and obesity, where there are excess amounts of circulating fatty acids, lipotoxicity can increase insulin resistance (and the demand for insulin) and diminish the ability to respond by worsening beta cell impairment (see Figure 4.2).\n",

      "How cancer immunotherapy works. In the context of cancer, the term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic targets. The history of immuno-oncology. The concept of immuno-oncology dates back more than 100 years, to 1893 (Figure 3.1). In that year, William Coley, an American surgeon and cancer researcher, observed remission of cancer in patients with postoperative bacterial infections, and suggested that activation of the immune system must play a role in combating cancer., Subsequently, in 1909, Paul Ehrlich suggested that the immune system must play an important role in preventing the development of cancer. However, it was not until the mid-20th century when Lewis Thomas and Frank MacFarlane Burnet hypothesized that the immune system is capable of eliminating cancerous cells through a process known as immune surveillance, and that this process depends on recognition of tumor-associated antigens by the immune system., Subsequently, through the laboratory work of Lloyd Old and Robert Schreiber, the concept of immune surveillance has evolved into 'immunoediting', reflecting the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. Increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of immunoediting has identified numerous potential therapeutic targets, some of which - notably immune checkpoint inhibition as first demonstrated by James Allison in the 1990s - are already yielding promising results in clinical practice., Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science.\n",

      "What types of tumor are potentially susceptible to immuno-oncology?. Clearly, the potential sensitivity of a given cancer to immuno-oncology therapies will depend on the ability of the tumor to trigger an immune response (immunogenicity). Cancer is characterized by an accumulation of genetic mutations, many of which result in the expression of cancer-specific antigens that can bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the cancer cell surface. These antigen-MHC complexes can be recognized by cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes, that, if activated, could potentially mount an immune response against the tumor. As a result, tumors with high somatic mutation rates may be more susceptible to immuno-oncology therapies than those with lower mutation rates. Somatic mutation rates differ markedly, both between tumor types and within an individual tumor type: the rate may vary more than 1000-fold between tumors with the highest and lowest rates (Figure 3.2).

      "Assessing the benefits and risks of immunotherapy in cancer. Assessment of the benefits and risks of cancer immunotherapies can be challenging, as the criteria used for conventional therapies cannot generally be extrapolated to immunotherapies. Assessing efficacy. A key issue in immuno-oncology is that patients may show a survival benefit in the absence of an objective response as defined by conventional RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Response to immunotherapies may vary markedly between patients: while some patients may show an initial response or stable disease, in others the response may be delayed because of the need to restore T-cell responses - a process that requires the interaction of numerous other immune cells. Indeed, in some patients, there is an initial phase of pseudoprogression during which the tumor appears to enlarge due to infiltration of newly reactivated T cells and subsequent inflammation. For these reasons, a set of immune-related response criteria (irRC) have been proposed (Table 3.6), relating to four patterns of response.\n",

      "Assessing safety and tolerability. Some immunotherapies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, are associated with immune-related adverse events such as fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and altered liver or kidney function (Figure 3.4). Many of these resemble the adverse events often seen with conventional chemotherapy but have different etiologies: while adverse events with conventional chemotherapy usually reflect cytotoxic effects on healthy tissue, adverse events with immunotherapies typically reflect actions on the immune system. For example, diarrhea associated with immunotherapy may be due to a reaction to gut-associated or self-antigens. Such adverse events require careful management, because although most are mild or moderate in severity, failure to recognize them as immune related could lead to suboptimal management, with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. For example, if untreated, diarrhea from immune-related colitis may become self-perpetuating, potentially leading to gut perforation. Patient education about such adverse events is essential: patients should be warned not to ignore 'slight' or 'mild' symptoms, but to seek medical advice as soon as possible. A multidisciplinary approach, involving oncologists, organ specialists and intensive care physicians, is essential for patients with severe immune-related adverse events.\n",

      "As described in Chapter 3, the risk of thrombosis in ET is assessed on the basis of age and previous history of thrombosis. Thus, a patient below the age of 60 years with no previous history of thrombosis would be considered at low risk of vascular complications, whereas an older patient or one with previous thrombosis is considered to be at high risk. Similarly, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations are associated with a higher risk of thrombosis than are calreticulin (CALR) mutations, and may therefore be considered an additional risk factor for thrombosis in patients with ET (Figure 4.2), although this has yet to be fully incorporated into clinical practice. The choice of treatment depends on the patient's risk level. In general, patients at the lowest level of risk defined by the International Prognostic Score for Essential Thrombocythemia (IPSET) scoring system (Table 3.6, page 38) - younger patients without JAK2 mutations, no cardiovascular risk factors and no history of thrombosis - can often be managed by observation only, and they may not require aspirin (yet to be validated in clinical practice). Low-risk patients with JAK2 mutations, or cardiovascular risk factors in the absence of JAK2 mutations, should perhaps be treated with aspirin.

However, this is counterbalanced by the finding that a small proportion of cancers in the finasteride group tended to be more aggressive than those in the placebo group, although this may have been an artifact of taking biopsies from the smaller prostates in the active treatment arm resulting from the shrinkage effect of finasteride. A 2013 study reported that there was no difference in the overall survival (OS) rate, or survival after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, between the placebo-treated and finasteride-treated patients after 18 years of follow-up.

      "'Depression', or 'clinical depression', refers to a mood disorder that ranges in severity from mild to severe, in duration from brief to enduring, and in pattern of illness from single to recurrent episodes. Diagnosis is based on the symptom profile and the severity, duration and course of the disorder. It is characterized by low mood and the absence of positive affect (id est loss of interest and enjoyment in everyday activities), together with a range of emotional, cognitive, physical and behavioral features. Clinical depression is a heterogeneous disorder, with some forms having clear biological underpinnings whereas others arise from psychosocial adversity. While classification systems have specified diagnostic criteria, uncertainties remain about the validity of the threshold that differentiates clinical depression from 'normal' unhappiness.\n",

      "Alongside the lack of clear biological characteristics for depression (as well as for a large number of other psychiatric conditions), there is a problem of where to draw the boundary between normal and pathological depression. The distinction between depression and the distress and angst that are part of normal human experience requires a dichotomization of this continuum of symptoms. Rather than being based on 'hard' criteria related to a clear causal mechanism, with associated biological markers, this differentiation is based on clinical characteristics. Although this is problematic, it is useful to bear in mind that this also applies to other common medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and irritable bowel syndrome, where the variation between extensive and disabling symptoms and few and insignificant symptoms are on a continuum. Delineating depression from other mental disorders. In the community, as well as in primary care settings, the most prevalent mood disorder is a combination of depression and anxiety.

In general, however, these adjustments to hypovolemia are poorly suited to pump failure, and increases in the preload and afterload of the failing heart lead to worsening HF (Figure 2.1). Neurohormonal pathways activated in HF include the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the natriuretic peptide (NP) system. They play a significant role in the pathophysiology of HF, and pharmacological interventions have been developed accordingly (see Chapter 7). Sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic activation of the adrenergic system leads to vasoconstriction, which increases the resistance to blood flow and helps to maintain arterial pressure in the early stages of HF when cardiac output is reduced. However, vasoconstriction also increases the afterload on the heart, leading to a worsening of HF (see Figure 2.1).\n",

      "Cardiorenal interactions. Reduced renal perfusion in HF (due to reduced stroke volume and vasoconstriction) is an important contributor to sodium and fluid overload. The exact links between cardiac and renal function have yet to be resolved. More marked disturbances of renal function, leading to coexisting renal failure, may also occur and pose problems for volume control. Clinical stages and functional classes. The clinical syndrome of HF represents the final manifestation of advanced disease. Although progress has been made in the management of this entity, the greatest hope of avoiding the adverse outcome of HF is to intervene at an earlier subclinical stage, when there is more likelihood of reversing the process. The American Cardiology Association (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines divide progression of the disease into four preclinical and clinical stages (Table 2.1). It is important to distinguish these from functional classes, as described in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which is based on severity of symptoms and exercise capacity and can be used to assess response to treatment (see Table 2.1). ACC/AHA stages A and B are preclinical; these patients fall into NYHA functional class I. ACC/AHA stage C reflects patients with symptoms or signs of HF, so these patients may be classified functionally in any of the NYHA classes I to III. The functional status of patients in ACC/AHA class D (with marked symptoms and signs of HF) is usually limited (NYHA class II to IV). The association between functional class, cardiac function (LVEF) and prognosis is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.\n",

      "Reasons to suspect P. acnes resistance are shown in Table 8.4. There are concerns that overuse of antibiotics will drive resistance in other commensal bacteria. Preventing resistance. It is difficult to culture P. acnes and, therefore, some overall guidelines are necessary to help the physician correctly suspect, prevent and treat P. acnes resistance. The emergence of resistance has raised the need for antibiotic prescribing policies and the need to consider the use of non-antibiotic preparations wherever possible. Principles for the optimal use of oral antibiotics are summarized in Table 8.5. Current thinking is that antibiotics should be administered for the shortest duration possible, and that combining them initially with topical retinoids will enhance efficacy. The advised length of treatment is 12 weeks. If longer than 12 weeks is required, anti-resistance agents such as BPO must be used concurrently. Combining non-antibiotic and antibiotic therapies results in more rapid efficacy, and this in turn may reduce the antibiotic exposure time. The same antibiotic should be used again if it previously produced a good clinical response. Antibiotics should not be used in the maintenance phase of therapy. P. acnes resistance should be suspected in patients who are not responding, patients who were responding but have relapsed, and those who have had 2-3 courses of different topical and oral antibiotics. Suspected resistant P. acnes should be targeted with antibiotics for which there is less evidence of resistance; higher rather than lower doses of a topical antibiotic should also be used. Likewise, higher oral doses of therapy may be indicated. Some preparations, such as non-antibiotic antimicrobials, id est BPO and topical retinoids, will never be associated with P. acnes resistance, nor will oral contraceptives or oral isotretinoin.\n",

The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Real-world evidence is the evidence derived from real-world data. In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute real-world data. However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial. They do not represent the overall population in a certain indication. Therefore, when working with clinical research, it is important to focus on the benefits of health-related data collected in natural settings - which may not be classified as 'real world' by a strict regulatory definition.\n",

Anti-EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, can be beneficial in patients with metastatic CRC provided that there is no downstream mutation activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Initially, patients with codon 12/13 KRAS mutations did not benefit in clinical trials, and subsequently mutations in other codons of KRAS and in NRAS were also shown to confer resistance to antibody-based therapies., Thus, guidelines require an 'extended' RAS analysis be performed. At present, the minimum testing required to determine whether anti-EGFR therapy may be of benefit is this extended RAS testing of KRAS and NRAS. codons 12 and 13 of exon 2. codons 59 and 61 of exon 3. codons 117 and 146 of exon 4. Wild-type phenotype for KRAS and NRAS is thus an indication for anti-EGFR therapy.\n",

      "Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations documented in all subtypes (Table 5.3)., The KIT mutation is associated with chronic sun damage. The BRAF mutation is present in 11% of patients with mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutation in 5% and KIT mutation in 15-20%. From a molecular point of view, uveal melanoma is a distinct condition characterized, in 50% of patients, by the presence of a GNAQ mutation. The presence of BRAF and NRAS mutations has not been described in uveal melanoma. The serine/threonine kinase BRAF is involved in the downstream signaling of the RTK and RAS proteins. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations (Figure 5.2). In the majority of cases, a valine at position 600 is mutated to glutamic acid or lysine (BRAF p.V600E and BRAF p.V600K); both mutations are associated with kinase activation that results from relieving an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction between the activation segment and P-loop of the protein.\n",

      "BRAF mutations are most common in the nodular and superficial spreading melanoma types, and they are rare in acral lentiginous (5-10% of cases) and non-cutaneous melanomas. BRAF mutation correlates with distinct histopathological features, such as intraepidermal melanoma nest formation and a larger rounder border of the tumor with the surrounding skin, suggesting surrogate markers can be used to select patients for molecular testing. BRAF mutations also arise more commonly in patients who are younger at presentation and those with lymph node metastasis (rather than satellite tumors or visceral metastasis). BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma, though these may be of short duration in some patients. Approximately 20% of patients with mutant BRAF melanoma show no response, and most patients treated with monotherapy relapse, with a median PFS of 8-9 months.\n",

      "The immune system has evolved to protect the host against infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, and to detect and eliminate potentially harmful foreign material. A hallmark of cancer is that tumor cells - which would normally be recognized by the immune system as abnormal - acquire the ability to evade the immune system. Immuno-oncology is a new, multi-faceted and rapidly evolving collection of treatment strategies aimed at harnessing immune processes to target and destroy tumor cells and prolong survival. An understanding of the basic elements of the normal and tumor-altered immune system is therefore key to understanding potential immuno-oncology therapies. The immune system consists of two components: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is conferred by mechanisms that are present throughout life, such as the physical barriers to infection provided by the skin and mucous membranes, white blood cells that remove foreign material, and serum proteins such as lysozymes and kinins.\n",

In general, innate immune reactions provide a rapid (within hours) but non-specific initial response to infection or injury, whereas adaptive immune responses are more specific to the foreign antigen and develop over a longer period (Figure 1.1). Innate immunity. In addition to the physical barrier of skin and membranes, innate immunity is primarily conferred by phagocytic cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. The most important of these include macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils, although other cell types, such as natural killer (NK) cells, also play important roles (Table 1.1).\n",

In both cases, immune cells are activated following exposure to antigens such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids or nucleic acids, leading to an immune response directed against specific antigens. Recognition of self and non-self. A key step in adaptive immunity is the presentation of antigens to immune cells. All cells present surface antigens that are complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins, allowing the immune system to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self'. In addition, however, dendritic cells act as 'professional' antigen-presenting cells (APCs), expressing MHC class I and II proteins that bind to antigens and present them to naive (undifferentiated) T cells (Figure 1.3).\n",

      "Cellular immunity. Surface T cell receptors (TCRs) are specific to individual antigens, and are activated when the TCR binds to the appropriate antigen. The availability of T cells to respond to the wide variety of potential antigens is achieved through extensive random rearrangements in the TCR gene during T-cell development in the thymus. Inevitably, such random rearrangements will occasionally produce TCRs that bind to 'self' antigens; in this situation, the T cells are eliminated or deactivated in a process known as self-tolerance. If this process is incomplete, autoimmune diseases may arise. T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of APCs in association with MHC molecules. CD4+ T cells, which are subdivided into helper (T h) and regulatory (T reg) T cells, recognize antigens bound to MHC class II molecules. Activation of T h cells, which requires a weaker stimulus than for cytotoxic T cells, leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells including APCs. There are two types of CD4+ T cell responses. Th1 responses are primarily directed against intracellular pathogens, and are characterized by production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, induction of opsonization, and antibody production by B cells. Th2 responses are effective against extracellular bacteria and parasites, and are characterized by production of interleukin (IL)-4 and -5. T reg cells mainly regulate and suppress the immune response of naive and effector T cells through a variety of cytokine and signaling mechanisms, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10. T reg cells regulate the immune response to common environmental allergens and prevent the development of atopy or undesirable inflammation. However, their role in maintenance of peripheral tolerance is also used by cancers to evade the immune system. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (also known as killer T cells) are activated by antigens from intracellular pathogens presented on MHC class I molecules. Activation of these cells triggers a process known as clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells (Teff). These cells recognize cells with a unique MHC class I-antigen complex, and release enzymes and toxins that lyse the cell membrane and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). To prevent extensive tissue damage during an infection, activation of CD8+ cells requires three signals (Figure 1.4).\n",

      "Development of immune tolerance. Immune tolerance is a state in which the immune system is unresponsive to a stimulus that would normally provoke an immune response. It is an important mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system. Immune tolerance may be central or peripheral, depending on where it is induced. central tolerance is induced in the thymus and bone marrow. peripheral tolerance is induced in lymph nodes or other tissues. Central tolerance is the principal mechanism by which the immune system learns to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self'. Maturing T and B lymphocytes in the thymus and bone marrow, respectively, are presented with self-antigens; cells bearing receptors for these antigens are removed by apoptosis or by induction of an inactive state known as anergy. Some autoreactive B cells may be retained in a state in which they do not respond to stimulation of their receptors. Conversely, some weakly autoreactive T cells may differentiate into natural regulatory T cells (nT reg), which act in the periphery to diminish potential T cell autoreactivity (see below).\n",

      "Mechanisms underlying cigarette addiction. There are almost certainly several mechanisms underlying smoking addiction, all involving nicotine in some way. Habit. One likely mechanism involves the development of a powerful 'habit' in which cues associated with smoking trigger an urge to smoke. This occurs because nicotine acts on a part of the brain that learns which responses are useful for survival in different situations. This part of the brain evolved in other species and operates at a level below conscious awareness. Thus, smokers experience urges to smoke when confronted with smoking cues, but these need not stem from any anticipated pleasure from smoking or conscious decision-making process. The facilitation of such compelling associations probably requires nicotine to be delivered rapidly, as from a cigarette, rather than slowly as from, say, the nicotine patch.\n",

These are all withdrawal symptoms resulting from physiological adaptation to repeated nicotine intake. Thus, nicotine does not alleviate these problems in people who do not smoke. Unfortunately, such discomfort can occur for all kinds of reasons, and the smoker's brain is not good at discriminating adverse mood states that arise from nicotine withdrawal from those arising from other causes. This means that smokers learn to associate adverse mood states and difficulty concentrating with smoking, and come to believe that smoking helps them to cope, even though it does so only because they are experiencing the problem because they have not smoked for a while. Unfortunately, as long as they believe that smoking helps to relieve adverse mood and other symptoms, smokers will be at risk of relapse when they try to stop. The sum of motivations. Putting all this together, we can see that there are probably at least three ways in which repeated ultra-rapid intake of nicotine from cigarettes creates powerful motivations to smoke, which undermine and overwhelm the resolve not to. Different smokers probably experience each of these three elements of nicotine dependence to differing degrees. Thus, some smokers clearly have a strong nicotine hunger and smoke as soon as they wake up in the morning and whenever the opportunity arises during the day. Others may not need to smoke for much of the day but experience powerful urges to smoke in particular situations, such as when socializing; this is particularly true of non-daily smokers.

In order to explain these apparent contradictions it has been hypothesized that the abnormal firing of the globus pallidus interna, rather than overactivity alone, contributes to the motor problems in Parkinson's disease, and pallidotomy works by removing this aberrant pattern of discharge. Latest thinking. It is now widely believed that the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease are not only due to the loss of a single monoamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, but also the effects of widespread Lewy body disease. This results in a convergence of deficits in multiple transmitter pathways, including the cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, which underpin many of the non-motor symptoms that are integral to Parkinson's disease (Figure 2.7). In addition, glial pathology, neuroimmune responses and proinflammatory cytokines are likely to play a key pathogenic role.

However, the clinical impact of these gene mutations has been limited because they are usually identified in patients with early-onset Parkinson's disease (exempli gratia with PARK2 and PINK1 [also known as PARK6 ]) or with atypical parkinsonism (as with MAPT). In the genome-wide scan for Parkinson's disease (GenePD) study, which investigated the effect of heterozygous PARK2 mutations on age of onset in patients with familial Parkinson's disease, one member from each of 183 families was screened for PARK2 mutations: 12.6% of the families were positive. Of these, 43% were compound heterozygotes, 13% were homozygotes and 10% were heterozygotes. The age of onset of Parkinson's disease was significantly lower in those with one PARK2 mutation than in those with none (11.7 years earlier), and also significantly lower in those with two mutations than in those with one (13.2 years earlier). The study showed that the PARK2 mutation is not rare, and that heterozygosity significantly lowers the age of onset of Parkinson's disease. Clinically, however, it is not possible to distinguish between patients with a Parkin -, PINK1 - and DJ-1 -linked form of Parkinson's disease. Studies in twins have been performed since 1967. Ward et al. studied 43 monozygotic and 19 dizygotic pairs of twins, and found that the concordance rate for parkinsonism was no more frequent in twins than expected, given the general rate of disease. They concluded that the main causative factors are probably not genetic. However, Parkinson's disease may be asymptomatic in the unaffected twin. Burn et al. studied 18-fluorodopa PET scans in sets of twins in which one of each pair had clinical Parkinson's disease. The clinically unaffected twin frequently had abnormally low 18-fluorodopa uptake. Follow-up of some of the twins revealed worsening of this abnormality, suggesting progressive deterioration of nigrostriatal function. The PET findings suggested concordance rates of 45% for monozygotic and 29% for dizygotic twins. Therefore, it seems that some genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease is likely.\n",

      "At the normal neuromuscular junction (NMJ), acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the motor neuron terminal, diffuses across the synaptic space and binds to ACh receptors (AChR), which are densely clustered on the folded endplate membrane of the muscle fiber. The high concentration of AChRs is crucial for efficient neuromuscular transmission. The ACh depolarizes the muscle endplate region, ultimately causing the muscle to contract (Figure 2.1). Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the best characterized autoimmune disorder of the nervous system. The immune-mediated nature of MG was suspected as early as the 1960s when it was speculated to be caused by a dysregulated immune response, with antibodies directed against skeletal muscle. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies. A series of animal and human experiments in the 1970s confirmed the above hypothesis, and elevated titers of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were ultimately discovered in the serum of patients with MG.

Complement-mediated lysis is thought to be the most important mode of loss of AChR, but the actual process that initiates the aberrant immune attack on the AChR is unknown. Both the immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody and complement have been localized to the motor endplate in myasthenia models, indicating that circulating IgG antibodies directed against the AChR bind to the postsynaptic membrane and activate the terminal complement sequence (C5b-9), or membrane attack complex (MAC). This results in lysis of the postsynaptic membrane, causing loss of the AChR (Figure 2.2). In fact, elevated MAC levels have been demonstrated in the plasma of patients with MG. 'Binding' antibodies are the most common type found in patients with MG. Accelerated internalization and degradation of acetylcholine receptors. A key mechanism of disease pathology in MG is the modulation, internalization and eventual destruction of AChRs at the NMJ by the crosslinking of AChR-specific autoantibodies (Figure 2.3).

      "Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. Although most patients with generalized MG have antibodies to AChR (see below), a minority of patients without AChR antibodies have antibodies to the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK). As discussed in Chapter 1, a higher percentage of patients with treatment-refractory MG have been found to have MuSK antibodies than those who respond to treatment. The disease can be particularly severe in patients with MuSK antibodies (see below). At present it is unclear how MuSK antibodies cause MG, but it is possible that MuSK antibodies alter AChR density or number. MuSK signaling is crucial for the development, long-term maintenance and stabilization of the postsynaptic portion of the NMJ. The antibodies in MuSK MG are largely of the IgG4 subclass and have been demonstrated in vitro to block the assembly and activation of MuSK. In animal models, administration of MuSK antibodies has resulted in reduced postsynaptic AChRs, disturbed synaptic alignment, reduced synaptic potentials and impaired muscle activation. Role of the thymus. Approximately 75% of patients who undergo thymectomy are found to have thymic pathology. Of these, 15% are discovered to have thymoma, and the remainder have evidence of lymphoid hyperplasia. Myoid cells are located in the thymus gland, and thymus tissue from patients with MG has been found to be enriched with AChR-reactive T cells. The close interaction between lymphocytes and myoid cells in the thymus, together with a yet-to-be-discovered stimulus that disrupts normal immune tolerance, may lead to the autoimmune response triggering MG.\n",

      "Functional MRI (fMRI) measures dynamic blood oxygen level-dependent variations in brain activity. For the purpose of surgical planning, this usually requires the patient to perform specific tasks (task-based fMRI). Most commonly, fMRI can assess language lateralization or motor cortical activation in relation to the tumor. fMRI is considered less reliable for accurate language localization, because the activation of language regions is complex, multifocal and not comprehensively explored by basic fMRI tasks. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) builds on standard diffusion-weighted imaging (see page 36) by including additional (a minimum of six) diffusion directions. These multidirectional data enable both the volume and the directionality of diffusion to be calculated. DTI tractography provides an approximation of the relations between the most eloquent white matter tracts and the tumor. Distances are usually expressed as estimates rather than exact (exempli gratia millimeter) measurements, because the depiction of white matter fibers can vary depending on the segmentation technique and threshold settings. Task-based fMRI and DTI tractography are valuable tools for localizing eloquent cortical and subcortical areas before glioma surgery (Figure 4.1), providing better accuracy than intraoperative stimulation mapping data.\n",

Postoperative radiotherapy alone was standard treatment until it was demonstrated that external beam radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy was more effective than radiotherapy alone (see below).

Doses above this are associated with increased toxicity with no additional survival benefit. Chemotherapy. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine-derived alkylating agent that is 100% bioavailable when taken orally, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 1 hour. Because of its small size and lipophilic properties, it can cross the blood-brain barrier. Temozolomide is administered orally at 75 mg/m daily during radiotherapy. After a duration of approximately 1 month, this is followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide at 150-200 mg/m on days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle. Temozolomide acts by preventing DNA replication through alkyl group-mediated crosslinking of DNA. Clinical data.

Most myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic conditions that remain clinically stable for many years; however, the condition may progress to acute leukemia in a minority of patients, referred to as MPN blast phase (MPN-BP).

In countries where prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is not widely used, about 30% of patients present with localized disease, 40% with locally advanced disease and the remaining 30% with metastases. In contrast to localized or locally advanced disease, metastatic prostate cancer is associated with high mortality - approximately 70% within 5 years. Androgen deprivation, which has become the mainstay of treatment, effectively reduces the intratumoral dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration by 70-80%, reducing stimulation of androgen receptors and increasing apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (Table 7.1).

      "It has been suggested that continuous androgen ablation therapy may, in fact, increase the rate of progression of prostate cancer to a castrate-resistant state (see Chapter 8), prompting the exploration of the use of intermittent hormonal therapy, which also has the potential advantage of decreasing the side effects of therapy. In this approach, hormone therapy is initially given for 6-9 months. If PSA levels become normalized, the LHRH analog/antagonist is temporarily discontinued. Hormone therapy is resumed when serum PSA returns to pretreatment levels in those with a PSA below 20 ng/mL at diagnosis, or when PSA exceeds 20 ng/mL in patients with an initial PSA above this. Such a regimen allows serum testosterone to return to normal, thereby stimulating atrophic cells and rendering them more sensitive to androgen ablation (Figure 7.4). The use of a pure LHRH antagonist, which blocks the receptor without initial stimulation (see page 89), could be advantageous in this setting given the absence of flare and, potentially, a more rapid restoration of testosterone level after cessation of therapy.\n",

Mechanical disorders of the lumbar spine are related to injury, overuse or deformity of a spinal structure. The most important traumatic factors in low back pain relate to soft tissue structures. Precise identification of the injured tissue, and the role of that injury in the consequent pain and dysfunction, can be frustratingly difficult. Problems occur in muscles, intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments or spinal nerves. Aging causes modification of these structures over time, and different parts of the spine tend to be at greater risk for change or injury during different decades of life.

      "The gluteal and piriformis muscles are shown in Figure 3.1. The primary functions of the gluteal muscles are to support, stabilize and mobilize the hips and lower extremities in relation to the pelvis and the trunk. Possibly the most common manifestation of lumbar and lumbosacral pain referral is to the mid-portion of the gluteal muscles (buttocks) that overlie the piriformis muscle. This is accompanied by a palpable localized region of deep, tender muscle induration. Because of the thickness of the overlying gluteus maximus muscle, the fibers of which are parallel to (and indistinguishable from) the piriformis muscle fibers, it is not possible to determine by palpation if the piriformis muscle per se is the source of the localized muscle tenderness. A 'piriformis syndrome' is therefore somewhat problematic to identify and must be carefully distinguished from the more common, spinal discogenic basis for sciatic radiculopathy. A piriformis syndrome may result from scarring after a fall on the buttocks or as a consequence of pelvic or hip surgeries. MRI can be used to visualize the tender area in the buttocks and help to identify selective piriformis entrapments of the sciatic nerve.\n",

Abnormalities of attention, verbal memory, eye-tracking and P50 have been shown to be more prevalent in family members than in the general population, leading to the supposition that these impairments may represent alternative phenotypic markers of the illness (see Chapter 4).

This metabolism can alter the menstrual cycle and increase turnover of the components of oral contraceptive pills and depot formulations of steroid hormones (Table 8.1). The risk of breakthrough pregnancy is not insignificant. An oral contraceptive formulation containing 50 µg of estrogen, with subsequent adjustment depending on the presence or absence of breakthrough bleeding, can provide secure contraception, as can barrier methods. Other birth control measures must be taken until the pattern of menstruation has been stable for at least 3 months. Lamotrigine (LTG) reduces levonorgestrel levels by about 20%, which is a potentially significant decrease. Levonorgestrel implants are contraindicated in women taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as they have an unacceptably high failure rate. This is also likely to be the case with the progesterone-only pill. Medroxyprogesterone injections appear to be effective, though they need to be given more frequently than is usually recommended. The morning-after contraceptive pill can be used after unprotected intercourse.

As a consequence of the missing enzyme function, very-long-chain fatty acids accumulate, causing demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) and the adrenal cortex. To initially test whether hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene transfer could treat this debilitating neurological disorder, two individuals with adrenoleukodystrophy were enrolled into a study. Lentiviral gene transfer was performed with autologous HSCs, and cells were transplanted following complete myeloablative conditioning. Impressively, these patients showed persistent therapeutic levels of aldolase protein for at least 3 years.

      "Huntington's disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes loss of cognitive functions, involuntary movements and emotional instabilities. The underlying genetic problem is the extension of a CAG trinucleotide repeat located in the HTT gene, encoding the huntingtin protein. While the CAG segment is normally repeated 10 to 35 times within the HTT gene, people with 40 or more repeats nearly always develop disease. Huntington's disease usually appears in people in their thirties or forties. The increased size of the CAG segment leads to the synthesis of an abnormally elongated huntingtin protein, which is broken down into smaller toxic fragments that aggregate and accumulate in neurons, thereby disrupting normal cell function and eventually leading to death of neurons. Hope for treatment of this disease comes from preclinical studies using AAV vectors that express not a therapeutic protein but a micro (mi)RNA that targets the HTT messenger (m)RNA and induces its degradation (the miRNA machinery of post-transcriptional regulation has evolved to specifically eliminate unwanted gene expression in a given cell type) (Figure 6.1). For example, an AAV5-miHTT vector was able to decrease production of the huntingtin protein by more than 50% in areas of gene transfer in the brains of minipigs that had been injected with the vector. Intracranial injections led to dose-dependent vector distribution to the striatum, putamen and spreading to the cerebral cortex. These areas are affected by neuropathological changes at different stages of the disease.\n",

      "Mutations in the gene for the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase-alpha (G6Pase-alpha) may result in the inability to degrade the polysaccharide glycogen. The accumulation of glycogen affects functions of multiple tissues. Children with GSDIa may have thin arms and legs, short stature and suffer from enlarged livers and kidneys. The hypoglycemia that results from the disease can be life-threatening. If chronically untreated, severe lactic acidosis, progression to renal failure and even death may occur in infancy or childhood. While there are no pharmacological therapies, consumption of sugar-free foods and drinks and regular intake of uncooked cornstarch, combined with other dietary adjustments, is helpful, particularly in milder forms of the disease. An investigational gene therapy is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial, based on systemic delivery of an AAV8 vector with hopes of achieving stable expression and activity of G6Pase-alpha under control of its native gene promoter. In preclinical studies, this gene therapy was particularly effective in reducing hepatic glycogen levels. Clinical efficacy measures include time to hypoglycemia during a controlled in-hospital fasting challenge, glycogen storage in liver (as determined by MRI) and changes in biomarkers such as lipids and uric acid. It has been reported that 'two of three patients in the first dose cohort experienced a sufficient increase in time to hypoglycemia such that they may be able to sleep through the night without taking supplemental cornstarch'. Improved glucose control throughout the day and the ability to decrease daily cornstarch intake are further encouraging signs that the therapy is effective.\n",

      "A more universally applicable and, moreover, lasting correction can be achieved by expressing 'mini'- or 'micro'-dystrophins from an AAV vector. These can be engineered in such a way that the packaging capacity of the vector is not exceeded. Using these constructs, dystrophin transgene expression in muscle fibers of patients has already been demonstrated following local intramuscular administration of vector. Furthermore, AAV capsids (such as AAV9 or AAVrh10) have been identified that are capable of infecting muscles throughout the body following high-dose intravascular administration. Intravascular delivery of AAV vectors expressing microdystrophins significantly ameliorated muscle pathology, increased muscle force and attenuated dystrophic cardiomyopathy in various small and large animal models such as dystrophic mice and dogs. Multiple competing Phase I/II clinical trials have now been initiated to test this approach in patients with DMD (Figure 6.2). These utilize AAV9 or AAVrh74 and muscle-specific promoters. Given the very large vector doses that are required (> 10 vector genomes/kg), there are some concerns for toxicities and immune responses. For instance, dystrophic muscles may be inflamed, and T-cell responses against therapeutic dystrophin have been observed in some patients in prior clinical studies. While steroids are given to limit inflammation, incidents of complement activation have also been reported.

In patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the onset of microalbuminuria is a major risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and mortality, and is also associated with retinopathy, left ventricular cardiac dysfunction and dyslipidemia, as well as hypertension. In all patients with microalbuminuria, other cardiovascular risk factors should be managed by, for example, lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the use of antihypertensive therapy, cessation of smoking and taking exercise. Diabetic nephropathy in pregnancy can lead to worse hypertension, an increased risk of pre-eclampsia and an accelerated decline in kidney function.\n",

      "Not all of the decrease in consumption involves smokers giving up altogether; in some cases smokers merely reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke. The health benefits of this action may be undermined, however, because smokers tend to smoke each cigarette more intensively. It is also not fully known how reductions in consumption translate into health benefits. Nevertheless, it is clear that increasing the cost of smoking is, potentially, an important public health measure. Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence. The size of the effect is related to the intensity of the campaign (as indexed by viewing numbers) and whether it is sustained. Specific quitting events, for example the UK's 'No Smoking Day' and 'Stoptober' (a mass quitting event that challenges smokers to be smoke-free for a month as a stepping stone to permanent cessation), and the US 'Great American Smokeout' (which encourages quitting for a day), have been evaluated as a highly cost-effective way of promoting smoking cessation. Bans on tobacco advertising. Tobacco companies spend many billions of dollars annually promoting their brands. In many countries, including the USA, tobacco advertising is banned from television but is permitted in print media.

For this reason, and because of moral concerns over permitting promotion of a product that is addictive and often lethal when used as intended, several countries, including those in the European Union, have implemented a total ban on tobacco promotion. An international treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (see Chapter 8) mandates this and other tobacco control measures.\n",

      "Genetic factors. The current state of the genetics of eating disorders is that while there is familial clustering of these syndromes, it is not at all clear that they are in their entirety genetically transmitted disorders. Whatever the genetic component to each one of them, it seems to be stronger for anorexia than bulimia. And granting even that, the current literature supports a polygenetic transmission of risk which needs substantial accumulation of environmental risk to have disorders come to the fore. The most potent risk factor for eating disorders is female gender (see Chapter 2). This association is likely to reflect biological as well as psychosocial factors. Family studies indicate that first-degree relatives of patients with anorexia have an increased prevalence of eating disorders (Table 3.1), and that first-degree relatives of patients with bulimia or binge-eating disorder appear to be at increased risk of eating disorders, mood disorders and substance abuse. Twin studies of anorexia and bulimia suggest there is approximately a 50-80% genetic contribution to liability accounted for by additive genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have initially focused on the serotonergic and other neurotransmitter system genes involved in bodyweight regulation, with hardly any unequivocally confirmed findings. Systematic genome-wide linkage scans based on families with at least two individuals with an eating disorder revealed initial linkage regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 4 (anorexia) and 10p (bulimia). Ongoing international collaborations are working at pooling cases and using newer forms of analysis such as genome-wide associations. Similar to other complex disorders, the eating disorders are likely to have a polygenic etiology, each gene having a relatively small effect. Physiological factors. Both high and low premorbid body mass index (BMI) may predispose to anorexia. Being overweight or obese (with a high BMI) is a risk factor because of the likelihood of dieting, while low BMI may characterize individuals who are already prodromally ill with anorexia but who have not yet reached the weight criteria for definitive diagnosis.\n",

While individuals often try to associate the onset of symptoms with other events (exempli gratia a viral infection or surgery), there is no firm epidemiological evidence to support a consistent trigger in this regard. Occasionally, an individual with ALS will perceive that the initial symptom came on overnight. Despite this assertion, they rarely seek acute services, unlike those who have a stroke, even though such individuals are frequently, and erroneously, referred for assessment as such.\n",

Individuals may describe food 'getting stuck' between the gums and the cheeks, especially with food that has a crumbly or leafy texture. LMN dysfunction of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing often results in coughing or choking, especially with thin liquids; swallowing may feel effortful or individuals may report 'food sticking'.

In upper motor neuron (cortico)bulbar disease, speech becomes strained and slow (Case report 3.2). Swallowing symptoms may be similar to those reported in LMN-predominant bulbar disease, with impaired coordination of pharyngeal muscle contraction. As a result, the individual may lose the automatic ability to coordinate swallowing or coughing in response to laryngeal stimulation, with explosive, though normally transient, choking as a result. More specific UMN symptoms include frequent gagging due to hypersensitivity of the gag response, and laryngospasm. Laryngospasms are brief, often painful, episodes of abrupt 'tightening' or 'squeezing' felt inside the throat, which impair inhalation and speech. They may be triggered by cold air, food particles or saliva. A less obvious but frequently encountered UMN bulbar symptom is pseudobulbar affect (PBA).

This results in a rising fasting glucose: as the insulin secretory capacity diminishes, fasting glucose rises further (Figure 4.2). Insulin secretion is further hindered by rising glucose levels which directly damage beta cells through a mechanism called glucotoxicity. Lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes is found in the muscle cells, where glucose is the major substrate. However, it has also been reported in the pancreas, where the effects of excess lipid can contribute to damage to insulin-secreting beta cells. Thus, in the situation of nutrient excess and obesity, where there are excess amounts of circulating fatty acids, lipotoxicity can increase insulin resistance (and the demand for insulin) and diminish the ability to respond by worsening beta cell impairment (see Figure 4.2).\n",

      "How cancer immunotherapy works. In the context of cancer, the term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic targets. The history of immuno-oncology. The concept of immuno-oncology dates back more than 100 years, to 1893 (Figure 3.1). In that year, William Coley, an American surgeon and cancer researcher, observed remission of cancer in patients with postoperative bacterial infections, and suggested that activation of the immune system must play a role in combating cancer., Subsequently, in 1909, Paul Ehrlich suggested that the immune system must play an important role in preventing the development of cancer. However, it was not until the mid-20th century when Lewis Thomas and Frank MacFarlane Burnet hypothesized that the immune system is capable of eliminating cancerous cells through a process known as immune surveillance, and that this process depends on recognition of tumor-associated antigens by the immune system., Subsequently, through the laboratory work of Lloyd Old and Robert Schreiber, the concept of immune surveillance has evolved into 'immunoediting', reflecting the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. Increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of immunoediting has identified numerous potential therapeutic targets, some of which - notably immune checkpoint inhibition as first demonstrated by James Allison in the 1990s - are already yielding promising results in clinical practice., Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science.\n",

      "What types of tumor are potentially susceptible to immuno-oncology?. Clearly, the potential sensitivity of a given cancer to immuno-oncology therapies will depend on the ability of the tumor to trigger an immune response (immunogenicity). Cancer is characterized by an accumulation of genetic mutations, many of which result in the expression of cancer-specific antigens that can bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the cancer cell surface. These antigen-MHC complexes can be recognized by cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes, that, if activated, could potentially mount an immune response against the tumor. As a result, tumors with high somatic mutation rates may be more susceptible to immuno-oncology therapies than those with lower mutation rates. Somatic mutation rates differ markedly, both between tumor types and within an individual tumor type: the rate may vary more than 1000-fold between tumors with the highest and lowest rates (Figure 3.2). The highest rates are seen in cancers of the skin, lung, bladder and stomach, while the lowest are seen in hematologic and pediatric cancers.

As a result, it has been suggested that immunotherapies should be classified according to their antigen specificity; however, even therapies initially directed against a single antigen may eventually become responsive to multiple antigens, a phenomenon known as epitope spreading.

Assessment of the benefits and risks of cancer immunotherapies can be challenging, as the criteria used for conventional therapies cannot generally be extrapolated to immunotherapies. Assessing efficacy. A key issue in immuno-oncology is that patients may show a survival benefit in the absence of an objective response as defined by conventional RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria. Response to immunotherapies may vary markedly between patients: while some patients may show an initial response or stable disease, in others the response may be delayed because of the need to restore T-cell responses - a process that requires the interaction of numerous other immune cells. Indeed, in some patients, there is an initial phase of pseudoprogression during which the tumor appears to enlarge due to infiltration of newly reactivated T cells and subsequent inflammation. For these reasons, a set of immune-related response criteria (irRC) have been proposed (Table 3.6), relating to four patterns of response.\n",

      "Assessing safety and tolerability. Some immunotherapies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, are associated with immune-related adverse events such as fatigue, diarrhea, nausea and altered liver or kidney function (Figure 3.4). Many of these resemble the adverse events often seen with conventional chemotherapy but have different etiologies: while adverse events with conventional chemotherapy usually reflect cytotoxic effects on healthy tissue, adverse events with immunotherapies typically reflect actions on the immune system. For example, diarrhea associated with immunotherapy may be due to a reaction to gut-associated or self-antigens. Such adverse events require careful management, because although most are mild or moderate in severity, failure to recognize them as immune related could lead to suboptimal management, with potentially serious or life-threatening consequences. For example, if untreated, diarrhea from immune-related colitis may become self-perpetuating, potentially leading to gut perforation. Patient education about such adverse events is essential: patients should be warned not to ignore 'slight' or 'mild' symptoms, but to seek medical advice as soon as possible. A multidisciplinary approach, involving oncologists, organ specialists and intensive care physicians, is essential for patients with severe immune-related adverse events.\n",

However, both studies included a small number of patients, and the influence of lactated Ringer's solution on important outcomes such as OF or mortality is unknown. In studies addressing other clinical scenarios, balanced fluids such as lactated Ringer's solution seem to be associated with a decreased need for blood products and a lower incidence of renal replacement therapy, hyperkalemia and postoperative infections when compared with normal saline. For the time being, it seems that lactated Ringer's solution is a good choice for fluid resuscitation in AP.\n",

Furthermore, it has been shown that standard nasojejunal feeding does in fact stimulate pancreatic secretion. Three studies comparing a nasogastric versus a nasojejunal route found no difference in outcomes, so both feeding routes can be recommended, depending on the presence or absence of gastric outlet obstruction. In 2014, the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group published an RCT in patients with predicted severe AP which compared early (within 24 hours) nasojejunal enteral nutrition versus on-demand nasojejunal enteral nutrition (the patients tried oral refeeding on the third day and enteral nutrition was given on the fourth day only to those who could not tolerate oral feeding). The study showed that on-demand oral feeding was not associated with worse outcomes, and only 31% of patients needed a nasojejunal tube. Overall, therefore, in patients with moderate-to-severe AP, oral refeeding on day 3 to 4 should be encouraged and nasogastric or nasojejunal tube feeding from day 4 should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate oral refeeding or who are sedated.

Thus, a patient below the age of 60 years with no previous history of thrombosis would be considered at low risk of vascular complications, whereas an older patient or one with previous thrombosis is considered to be at high risk. Similarly, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations are associated with a higher risk of thrombosis than are calreticulin (CALR) mutations, and may therefore be considered an additional risk factor for thrombosis in patients with ET (Figure 4.2), although this has yet to be fully incorporated into clinical practice.

Unfortunately, by the time most patients develop brain metastases, they have already been exposed to the most effective chemotherapeutic agents and the metastatic clones are relatively chemoresistant. Although the blood-brain barrier is focally disrupted, water-soluble chemotherapy may not penetrate sufficiently to reach a therapeutic concentration. In spite of this, chemotherapy may be useful in treating some individuals with brain metastases. Newly diagnosed patients who are chemotherapy naïve and neurologically asymptomatic may respond favorably to systemic chemotherapy. They should be followed closely with serial MRI and neurological examinations to monitor their response to treatment.

Rather than being based on 'hard' criteria related to a clear causal mechanism, with associated biological markers, this differentiation is based on clinical characteristics.

The clinical syndrome of HF represents the final manifestation of advanced disease. Although progress has been made in the management of this entity, the greatest hope of avoiding the adverse outcome of HF is to intervene at an earlier subclinical stage, when there is more likelihood of reversing the process. The American Cardiology Association (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines divide progression of the disease into four preclinical and clinical stages (Table 2.1). It is important to distinguish these from functional classes, as described in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which is based on severity of symptoms and exercise capacity and can be used to assess response to treatment (see Table 2.1). ACC/AHA stages A and B are preclinical; these patients fall into NYHA functional class I. ACC/AHA stage C reflects patients with symptoms or signs of HF, so these patients may be classified functionally in any of the NYHA classes I to III. The functional status of patients in ACC/AHA class D (with marked symptoms and signs of HF) is usually limited (NYHA class II to IV).

      "Reasons to suspect P. acnes resistance are shown in Table 8.4. There are concerns that overuse of antibiotics will drive resistance in other commensal bacteria. Preventing resistance. It is difficult to culture P. acnes and, therefore, some overall guidelines are necessary to help the physician correctly suspect, prevent and treat P. acnes resistance. The emergence of resistance has raised the need for antibiotic prescribing policies and the need to consider the use of non-antibiotic preparations wherever possible. Principles for the optimal use of oral antibiotics are summarized in Table 8.5. Current thinking is that antibiotics should be administered for the shortest duration possible, and that combining them initially with topical retinoids will enhance efficacy. The advised length of treatment is 12 weeks. If longer than 12 weeks is required, anti-resistance agents such as BPO must be used concurrently. Combining non-antibiotic and antibiotic therapies results in more rapid efficacy, and this in turn may reduce the antibiotic exposure time. The same antibiotic should be used again if it previously produced a good clinical response. Antibiotics should not be used in the maintenance phase of therapy. P. acnes resistance should be suspected in patients who are not responding, patients who were responding but have relapsed, and those who have had 2-3 courses of different topical and oral antibiotics. Suspected resistant P. acnes should be targeted with antibiotics for which there is less evidence of resistance; higher rather than lower doses of a topical antibiotic should also be used. Likewise, higher oral doses of therapy may be indicated. Some preparations, such as non-antibiotic antimicrobials, id est BPO and topical retinoids, will never be associated with P. acnes resistance, nor will oral contraceptives or oral isotretinoin.\n",

However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial. They do not represent the overall population in a certain indication.

CpG island methylator (CIMP), which is found in 17% of CRCs and shows overlap with the MSI pathway. Chromosomal instability is characterized by alterations in chromosomes 17p and 18q. In addition, the tumors acquire mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors including APC, TP53, KRAS and BRAF. According to the Vogelstein model, there is initial inactivation of APC, followed by mutations of RAS with inactivation of the TP53 suppressor gene. The most clinically relevant pathways affected are the Wnt and MAPK pathways. Alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway, which occur in 93% of all CRC tumors, lead to cell proliferation. The MAPK pathway is activated by RTKs, such as EGFR, though it can be activated by other downstream signaling molecules, such as KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS), NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS) and BRAF, as well as ERK.\n",

      "Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations documented in all subtypes (Table 5.3)., The KIT mutation is associated with chronic sun damage. The BRAF mutation is present in 11% of patients with mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutation in 5% and KIT mutation in 15-20%. From a molecular point of view, uveal melanoma is a distinct condition characterized, in 50% of patients, by the presence of a GNAQ mutation. The presence of BRAF and NRAS mutations has not been described in uveal melanoma. The serine/threonine kinase BRAF is involved in the downstream signaling of the RTK and RAS proteins. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations (Figure 5.2). In the majority of cases, a valine at position 600 is mutated to glutamic acid or lysine (BRAF p.V600E and BRAF p.V600K); both mutations are associated with kinase activation that results from relieving an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction between the activation segment and P-loop of the protein.\n",

      "BRAF mutations are most common in the nodular and superficial spreading melanoma types, and they are rare in acral lentiginous (5-10% of cases) and non-cutaneous melanomas. BRAF mutation correlates with distinct histopathological features, such as intraepidermal melanoma nest formation and a larger rounder border of the tumor with the surrounding skin, suggesting surrogate markers can be used to select patients for molecular testing. BRAF mutations also arise more commonly in patients who are younger at presentation and those with lymph node metastasis (rather than satellite tumors or visceral metastasis). BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma, though these may be of short duration in some patients. Approximately 20% of patients with mutant BRAF melanoma show no response, and most patients treated with monotherapy relapse, with a median PFS of 8-9 months.\n",
