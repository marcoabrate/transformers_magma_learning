The immune system has two components: innate immunity, involving mechanisms present throughout life, and adaptive (acquired) immunity, which is conferred by immune responses following exposure to an antigen, and is specific to that antigen.
Innate immunity is primarily conferred by phagocytic cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow, principally macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils.
There are two forms of adaptive immunity: cellular immunity mediated by T cells originating in the thymus, and humoral immunity mediated by B cells originating in the bone marrow.
In cellular immunity, T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.- Activation of CD4+ T cells leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells, including APCs.- Activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells triggers clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells, which release enzymes and toxins that lyse the membrane of antigen-bearing cells and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis).
Humoral immunity involves the production by B cells of antibodies against specific antigens.
Immune tolerance is a state in which the immune system is unresponsive to a stimulus that would normally provoke an immune response. This may be central or peripheral, depending on where tolerance develops. Immune tolerance is an important mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system.
Surgery is the preferred treatment for all patients with early-stage (I-II) NSCLC, with radiotherapy reserved for those unsuitable for surgery.
Stereotactic body radiotherapy is an alternative to surgery in peripheral stage I-II tumors less than 5 cm.
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is preferred to sequential chemoradiotherapy in stage IIB-IIIB disease.
Postoperative radiotherapy is recommended when residual disease is present; it can also be discussed in patients with complete resections with pN2 disease.
Patients with advanced disease and poor performance status should receive 10 Gy in 1 fraction for palliation of intrathoracic disease.
Cigarette addiction involves powerful motivations to smoke that undermine and overwhelm the desire to avoid smoking because of its social, financial and health costs.
Cigarette addiction stems primarily from nicotine dependence.- Repeated rapid intake of nicotine from cigarettes sets up a powerful association between smoking and situations in which smoking typically occurs.- It also creates 'nicotine hunger' so that when brain nicotine levels fall, the smoker experiences a need to smoke.- It creates unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, including mood disturbance, because of physiological adaptation.
The withdrawal symptoms are relieved by smoking, thus generating the feeling of a need to smoke whenever these symptoms are experienced, even if they are caused by something else.
Addiction to cigarettes is demonstrated by the fact that fewer than 5% of serious attempts to stop smoking succeed without behavioral support or pharmacological treatment.
Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with a prevalence of approximately 200 per 100 000 individuals.
The incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease increases sharply with age.
Men are 1.5 times more likely than women to develop the disease.
Pathologically, Parkinson's disease is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration including that of neuromelanin-containing neurons, as well as deficits in the serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic systems that result in the manifestation of motor and non-motor symptoms. Lewy bodies in the remaining nigral neurons are a pathological hallmark of the disease after death.
Braak has suggested that the condition may begin in the olfactory bundle and lower brainstem, and studies are under way to identify specific non-motor biomarkers of the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease.
The cause of neuronal degeneration is uncertain.
Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD), late-onset hyposmia, constipation and major depression are all risk factors for Parkinson's disease.
At present, there are no guidelines for genetic testing in Parkinson's disease. Genetic tests for common mutations such as LRRK2 Gly2019Ser mutations in at-risk individuals (European, North African and Ashkenazi Jewish), glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) mutations, or Parkin (autosomal recessive) are usually available if they are thought to be clinically relevant and necessary. Where possible, advice from a genetic counselor must be obtained before genetic testing.
In myasthenia gravis (MG), pathogenic antibodies against acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) or muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) are responsible for the abnormal neuromuscular junction transmission leading to muscle weakness.
Antibodies to AChRs reduce the number of AChRs by several pathological mechanisms including complement-activated damage, antigenic modulation leading to accelerated endocytosis and degradation of the AChR, and direct blockade of the receptor.
Abnormal thymic pathology is associated with AChR-antibody-positive MG, particularly late-onset disease.
About 7% of cases of generalized MG have antibodies to MuSK. This is a distinct clinical subset of the disease, which is generally more severe than AChR-antibody-positive MG, not associated with thymic pathology and more likely to be refractory to treatment.
It is important to recognize that gliomas that appear to be low-grade tumors histologically may carry mutations associated with higher-grade tumors.
The use of methylation arrays can add diagnostic information to brain tumors that are otherwise diagnostically difficult, or where conventional molecular tests do not give informative results.
A variety of MRI features characterize glioblastoma, including solid contrast uptake and absence of enhancement.
Advanced modalities such as diffusion and perfusion MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy can support the characterization of gliomas, with a view to grading, genotyping and differential diagnosis.
Anatomic MRI is required for the identification, characterization and estimation of disease extent. Early glioblastoma can present as small, barely visible lesions.
Differential diagnoses may include metastatic disease, primary central nervous system lymphoma and therapy effects such as pseudoprogression and/or radiation necrosis.
Pancreatic cancer should be suspected in any patient (over 40 years of age) with unresolving epigastric symptoms.
Accurate detection and staging are based on CT and may be supplemented by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), MRI and laparoscopy.
Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma must be managed by a multidisciplinary team in a high-volume regional pancreas cancer center.
If the cancer is not resectable, symptoms may be relieved with EUS-guided celiac plexus neurolysis and non-surgical treatment consisting of chemotherapy (exempli gratia gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidine combinations) and pain management.
In borderline resectable patients, preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation can be considered.
Adjuvant chemotherapy is used systematically following resection.
Federal regulations and accepted ethical principles are in place to guide the conduct of research so that the science is rigorous and the participants are protected.
Globally, it is common to conduct an ethics review of behavioral and biomedical research; this is carried out by an institutional review board (IRB), a research ethics board or a research ethics committee.
While IRB approval is an important step in the process for identifying and mitigating risk in studies, it is truly the responsibility of developers, researchers and clinicians to be a part of the ethical decision-making process.
Because digital measurement methods are relatively new, accessing resources and asking questions at the protocol development phase are critical.
Terms of service and end user license agreements are not a substitute for informed consent.
Lack of guidelines and exploitation of consumer data have led to new regulations that speak to consent and privacy concerns, including the General Data Protection Regulations in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act.
Patients with glioblastoma should be cared for by a multidisciplinary team.
The initial therapeutic approach is surgical tumor debulking and biopsy; maximum tumor resection should be attempted if neurological function can be maintained.
Functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging are valuable for surgical planning in gliomas that are situated close to eloquent (exempli gratia language, motor, visual) regions of the brain.
The current standard of care is surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy radiotherapy over 6 weeks with concomitant temozolomide, 75 mg/m daily), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, 150-200 mg/m on days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle.
Methylation of the MGMT promoter gene is the strongest predictor for outcome and benefit from temozolomide therapy.
Prognostic factors associated with improved survival with the standard of care are younger age, better performance status, Mini-Mental State Examination score of at least 27 and no steroid treatment at baseline.
MRI is the preferred method for following up patients. MRI scans are commonly performed every 3-4 months, unless the patient's clinical status dictates more frequent monitoring. Routine blood tests are not required for patients who are not receiving chemotherapy.
Therapy effects may manifest as transient worsening (pseudoprogression, radiation necrosis) or misleading improvement (pseudoresponse) of enhancing lesions. Interpretation of MRI scans after treatment can be complex. Treatment timing must be considered. In challenging cases, response assessment may benefit from physiological imaging techniques, including perfusion and PET imaging.
A standard of care has not been established for patients whose disease progresses after chemotherapy; enrolment into clinical trials is recommended if patients meet the inclusion criteria.
Radiotherapy and temozolomide is suitable for fit elderly patients with glioblastoma.
Prevention currently means advice to avoid trauma and high-impact repetitive loading of joints.
Essential management requires involving and educating the person and choosing a range of non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies.
Muscle strengthening, aerobic exercise and weight loss are a good starting point for management.
Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) may progress to acute leukemia (MPN-blast phase [MPN-BP]) in a minority of patients. This transformation most commonly occurs in patients with primary myelofibrosis but may also occur in those with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera (PV) (usually only after first progressing to post-ET/PV myelofibrosis).
Risk factors for MPN-BP include leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and unfavorable karyotype.
Signs of accelerating myelofibrosis may precede the development of overt leukemia.
MPN-BP is associated with a poor prognosis: in the absence of active treatment, median survival is 2-6 months.
There is no standard of care for MPN-BP, and treatment regimens are derived from experience in acute myeloid leukemia. All eligible patients should receive induction chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Achieving a complete response during induction chemotherapy is essential for an optimal outcome after SCT.
Patients with MPN-BP who are not eligible for induction chemotherapy or SCT may benefit from treatment with hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine (perhaps in combination).
A luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog preceded and then accompanied by an antiandrogen is the most frequent treatment strategy.
Responses in terms of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction and clinical improvement are seen in more than 80% of patients.
The side effects of medical castration include hot flashes, loss of libido and erectile dysfunction, and the reduced testosterone level may also be associated with features of the metabolic syndrome.
Men with a high volume of metastases should be treated with a combination of androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel chemotherapy.
Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer is usually by androgen ablation.
Treatment with a pure LHRH antagonist is another option, which avoids the need for an antiandrogen.
Eventually, androgen-insensitive cell clones develop and the PSA level begins to rise (castrate resistance).
Current data from multiple large studies suggest that neither the 5-HT receptor antagonists (RAs) nor the NK-1 RAs are effective in the prevention of nausea in patients receiving either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, despite marked improvement in the control of emesis.
Phase III clinical studies suggest that olanzapine may be an important agent in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and in the treatment of breakthrough CINV.
Non-pharmacological measures for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea include avoidance of strong odors, eating small amounts of spicy food, avoiding smoking and caffeine, and acupuncture.
Diagnosis is based on an accurate history, evaluation of clinical features, assessment of severity and recognition of psychological or social issues. Further investigations are rarely required.
Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation may persist for many months in type IV-VI skins following the resolution of acne.
Acne scarring is a very common sequel to acne.
Late-onset acne in females may relate to hyperandrogenism. Further investigations should be carried out to determine if there is an underlying endocrinological problem.
Drugs, industrial agents and friction may all contribute to acne.
Differential diagnoses of acne include drug-induced acneiform eruptions, rosacea, pyoderma faciale, gram-negative folliculitis and perioral dermatitis.
Acne presents with both inflammatory and comedonal lesions in most patients.
Acne severity can be determined according to the type, number, distribution or location of lesions, or a combination of each of these. There are many scales available for this, but no gold standard at present.
All back pain is 'psychosomatic', because any somatic pain that is experienced must be experienced in the central nervous system and then processed by the individual to express its impact.
Acute pain must be resolved rapidly to prevent the modification of the central nervous system to a chronic pain status.
Mechanical disorders - muscle strain, spondylolisthesis, herniated intervertebral disc, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis - are the most common causes of low back pain.
Radiographic spinal stenosis, facet arthrosis and disc protrusions are very common and correlate poorly with symptoms after age 50.
Piriformis tenderness is an area of local tenderness deep to the gluteus maximus muscle, and tenderness palpated in that area most often represents a referred trigger point in the gluteus maximus muscle rather than specific piriformis sciatic nerve syndrome involvement.
Facet arthritis and trochanteric bursal irritation both may produce symptomatology that mimics sciatic nerve involvement.
Virtually all patients taking prolonged levodopa experience long-term complications within 2-3 years of treatment.
Most dyskinesias progress; smaller, more frequent doses of levodopa, or a combination of the drug with a dopamine agonist, may help but problems are likely to reappear.
Patients who are confused and hallucinating become difficult to manage at home and life expectancy may diminish to 1-2 years.
Depression should be treated with antidepressants; depression/anxiety is a marker for dementia in older patients.
Sleep disorders may affect 60-98% of patients with Parkinson's disease; the presence of rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder may precede the motor diagnosis by years.
The cause of death in Parkinson's disease is most commonly a secondary comorbid disorder.
People with schizophrenia exhibit subtle neurocognitive impairments prior to the onset of florid psychotic symptoms.
Neurocognitive impairments are a major determinant of poor social and occupational functioning.
Positive psychotic symptoms correlate with hippocampal activation and frontostriatal disconnectivity.
Negative symptoms correlate with decreased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
The disorganization syndrome correlates with increased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus.
Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) typically present with vague symptoms resulting from pancytopenia. Fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and vague bone pain in the back or pelvis are common. Fever, infection or abnormal hemostasis may be the presenting symptom in some patients.
Typical hematologic findings include normochromic, normocytic anemia, elevated white blood cell count and mild thrombocytopenia; the presence of Auer rods on light microscopy distinguishes acute myeloid from lymphoblastic leukemia.
The diagnosis of AML is based on a finding of 20% or more myeloblasts although this is not a requirement in the presence of t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16) cytogenetic abnormalities.
Cytogenetic and genetic tests are key aspects of the diagnostic work-up, required to aid rapid diagnosis, assess prognosis and inform treatment. Current genetic testing should include at least FLT3 (with allelic ratio), NPM1, CEBPA (bi-allelic), IDH1, IDH2 and TP53.
The French-American-British morphologic classification of AML has been superseded by the World Health Organization classification and European LeukemiaNet stratification, which provide prognostic categories of 'favorable', 'intermediate' and 'adverse risk' based on cytogenetic and genetic findings.
Ovarian cancer will recur in approximately two-thirds of patients with advanced ovarian cancer after primary treatment.
The choice of treatment in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer will depend on a number of patient-, drug- and tumor-related factors.
Platinum-sensitive patients are generally treated with platinum-containing regimens. Platinum-resistant patients are generally treated with non-platinum single agent chemotherapies with or without bevacizumab.
Survival data and response rates are suboptimal with all single-agent therapies used in platinum-resistant recurrent disease: new therapies are needed in this setting.
Physical activity is a key component of weight management and is important for maintaining weight lost by any method of treatment.
Physical activity is beneficial regardless of weight loss, as it reduces cardiometabolic risk, insulin resistance and cancer risk.
Although the amount of weight loss induced by exercise alone may be disappointing, there are beneficial changes in fat distribution and body composition.
An increase in physical activity can be achieved by modifications to the daily routine; multiple short bouts are just as beneficial as the equivalent amount of activity performed in one session.
Some aerobic activity that leads to shortness of breath each day provides additional benefit, and some resistance exercise should also be included.
Oral contraceptives containing at least 50 µg of estrogen should be used when coadministered with carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and rufinamide, and topiramate at doses over 200 mg daily, because these drugs induce the metabolism of female sex hormones.
Intermittent clobazam just before and shortly after the onset of menstruation can be used in women who experience catamenial seizures.
AED treatment is continued when necessary during pregnancy because seizures, especially convulsive seizures, are more harmful to the mother and fetus than the drugs themselves; however, treatment should be tapered to a minimally effective dose before pregnancy, if possible to a single AED.
Supplemental folic acid, 4-5 mg daily, should be administered before conception and continued at least until the end of week 12 of gestation.
The risk of major malformations in babies exposed in utero seems to be greater with sodium valproate (VPA) than with other AEDs.
A witness's account is particularly important for the correct diagnosis of epilepsy in the elderly, in whom the presentation of seizures is often subtle.
Low doses of AEDs are recommended in the elderly in order to minimize adverse effects, particularly neurotoxicity. Preferred choices include lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV).
The teenage years are an appropriate time for counseling on contraception and other lifestyle issues including driving, social interactions and careers.
Broad-spectrum AEDs (exempli gratia VPA, LTG, TPM, LEV, zonisamide) should be the treatment of choice in people with learning difficulties; barbiturates and benzodiazepines should be avoided.
Lower urinary tract symptoms are key in the diagnosis of bladder disorders: onset, duration and severity should be recorded.
Urinary symptoms can relate to filling (frequency, nocturia, urgency), storage (stress incontinence, urgency incontinence, nocturnal enuresis) or voiding/emptying (hesitancy, intermittent stream, slow stream, terminal dribble, incomplete emptying).
Physical examination is essential, and may include neurological examination, abdominal examination and examination of the genitals.
Dipstick urinalysis is essential for all patients with urinary incontinence, bladder or urethral pain and is good practice in those with voiding/emptying symptoms. Positive tests should be evaluated further.
Other assessments include cognitive and mobility evaluation, especially in the elderly.
The effect of symptoms on quality of life can be assessed using self-completion questionnaires.
A frequency/volume bladder record (bladder diary) is a simple and practical method to record voiding and fluid intake.
Urodynamic investigation can provide a wide variety of information, but is not necessarily indicated for all patients.
Multiple gene therapies are showing efficacy in preclinical studies or early-phase trials.
Some of the most difficult targets are neurodegenerative diseases that require direct administration of vector into the brain and/or elimination of toxic gene products. In this case, the transgene may express a microRNA rather than a therapeutic protein to destroy the transcript for the endogenous toxic protein, such as in Huntington's disease.
Hemopoietic stem cell gene transfer applications are being expanded to sickle cell disease and to certain central nervous system disorders.
Systemic delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors using high-dose intravenous infusions are now being tested for the treatment of diseases that require gene transfer to multiple organs such as muscular dystrophies, lysosomal storage disorders and neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.
Advances in vector manufacturing, identification of viral capsids with suitable tropism and, in some cases, ability of the vector to cross the blood-brain barrier in young individuals have facilitated developments in AAV virus-mediated therapies.
Patients reporting more than one unprovoked seizure usually require treatment; treatment after a single unprovoked seizure could be considered if the chance of recurrence is high.
At the start of treatment, a single antiepileptic drug (AED) should be given at a low dose and slowly titrated to an effective dose.
First-line AEDs should be chosen according to the patient's seizure type(s) and/or epilepsy syndrome. Other important factors include the likelihood of side effects, lack of long-term sequelae, and a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions.
None of the newer AEDs has shown superior efficacy when tested against established agents for the treatment of partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, although some may be better tolerated.
Combination AED therapy could be used after failure of two monotherapies in series or if the first AED is well tolerated but fails to completely control the seizures.
Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as failure of adequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules (whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom.
A small number of patients will demonstrate a sustained response to the fourth, fifth, sixth or even seventh regimen, and so drug-resistant epilepsy should never be viewed nihilistically.
Patients should be referred to a specialist for definitive diagnosis and initiation of treatment, or when seizures prove refractory to medication, they are planning for pregnancy or hoping to stop treatment in the case of remission.
The primary care physician should play an important role in coordinating professional care for people with epilepsy.
Blood pressure targets are less than 130/80 mmHg or lower in the presence of albuminuria (> 500 mg/day) and less than 140/90 mmHg in the absence of albuminuria.
Pregnant women with significant renal impairment are likely to have hypertension, pre-eclampsia and premature labor.
Medications, particularly antihypertensive agents, require careful review in pregnant women with renal disease.
Hypertension is both an important cause and a consequence of renal disease.
The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is microalbuminuria, which can be tested by an increased albumin:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample (> 2.5 mg/mol in men or 3.5 mg/mol in women).
All patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened for incipient or established diabetic nephropathy, as microalbuminuria is present in about 25% of patients at diagnosis.
Microalbuminuria is rarely present at diagnosis in type 1 diabetes; these patients should therefore be screened at the onset of puberty or 5 years after diagnosis, then annually.
The major risk factor for development of diabetic nephropathy is hyperglycemia.
Aggressive intervention in patients with incipient or established nephropathy unequivocally prevents progression of renal disease.
Treatment strategies for diabetic nephropathy include aggressive glycemic control, angiotensin blockade, blood pressure control, protein restriction and smoking cessation.
For optimal renal protection in patients with chronic kidney disease, angiotensin blockade with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is recommended.
In western countries, smoking is more prevalent in people with mental health problems, those with alcohol- and drug-related problems, the homeless and criminals.
Smoking prevalence is strongly influenced by social norms and the financial cost. High-intensity and sustained mass media campaigns and mass quitting events, such as Stoptober, have an important effect in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence. Banning tobacco marketing and bans on smoking in indoor public areas probably also play a role.
Clinicians and patients are best served by considering eating disorders from a bio-psycho-social perspective, unified in a framework of developmental psychopathology. All components are present, and interact to increase the risk for disorder as development proceeds. Disorder represents the crystallization of these interactions into syndromes which, in this case, are a developmental outcome, not simply the burgeoning of a latent biological deficit, as reductionist models of psychopathology would have it.
Parental attitudes and behaviors towards eating, weight and body shape have a strong influence on the development of a child's relationship with food and body image, both healthy and unhealthy.
Eating problems usually emerge in the context of pubertal change.
Stressors and life events, such as childhood abuse, separations or bereavement, may precipitate the onset of eating disorders.
Psychiatric comorbidities in both men and women with eating disorders include depression, anxiety, obsessive behavior and body-image disturbance.
When treating a patient with either an eating disorder or substance-abuse problem, clinicians should always consider the possibility of comorbidity.
Prostate cancer is soon likely to supersede lung cancer as the most common cause of cancer death in men in western countries, as fewer men smoke and the population is aging.
Age is the greatest risk factor but race, family history, western-style diet and obesity also have an effect.
Most prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas arising in the peripheral zone of the gland.
Prostate cancers are graded according to the Gleason system, which carries prognostic significance.
The key symptom of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is painless weakness. A history of progression is essential for the diagnosis. The weakness is often asymmetric.
The individual symptoms reflect the body part affected and the balance between the burden of upper (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) disease.
UMN disease causes slowness, stiffness, clumsiness and loss of fluidity of movement. Weakness is less pronounced and occurs in a pyramidal pattern. Tone may be increased, repetitive movements are slowed and reflexes are brisk. Speech may be strained, slowed and spastic. There may be pseudobulbar affect (emotional lability), dysphagia and a hyperactive gag response.
Approximately a third of cases start with weakness in an arm, a third with weakness in a leg and a quarter to one-third have bulbar onset.
LMN disease causes atrophy, fasciculation, weakness and cramps. Weakness may be profound and commonly affects muscles supplied by more than one myotome or peripheral nerve. Reflexes are reduced. Speech may be slurred or nasal. The tongue may be symmetrically atrophic and weak, with visible fasciculation.
More uncommon presentations include respiratory onset, a pure UMN syndrome (primary lateral sclerosis), and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.
Type 2 diabetes results from a relative deficiency of insulin, often in the context of insulin resistance.
Nutrient excess and obesity contribute to insulin resistance, through mechanisms that include cell signaling defects, lipotoxicity and inflammation.
As the pancreatic secretion of insulin starts to fail, glucose levels progressively rise due to dysregulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.
The term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic targets.
The potential sensitivity of a given cancer to immunotherapy depends on the immunogenicity of the tumor, which is related to the somatic mutation rate within tumor cells.- The highest mutation rates are seen in cancers of the skin, lung, bladder and stomach, rendering these tumor types more sensitive to immunotherapy.
Immunotherapies are conventionally classified as passive or active, depending on their ability to activate an immune response against tumor cells.- Passive immunotherapies include tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies, adoptive cell transfer and oncolytic viruses.- Active immunotherapies include dendritic cell-based therapies, vaccines, immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies (immune checkpoint inhibitors) and pattern recognition receptor agonists.
Efficacy criteria used for conventional cancer therapies cannot readily be extrapolated to immunotherapies.- Survival may be increased in the absence of an objective response as assessed by conventional criteria, and hence immune-related response criteria are required.
Immune-related adverse events are generally due to autoimmune inflammation through uncontrolled T-cell activation.- Such events should be treated promptly to prevent potentially harmful escalation: patient education is essential in this respect.
Patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) must be carefully monitored to allow early detection of organ failure, particularly those patients with predicted severe disease.
Lactated Ringer's solution is associated with a decreased inflammatory response in AP when compared with normal saline.
There is a lack of well-designed randomized clinical trials addressing the best fluid volume rate to improve outcomes.
Opioids are safe in AP. Epidural analgesia may be used in refractory pain
Oral refeeding when abdominal pain subsides is recommended in all patients with pancreatitis. Tube feeding (either nasogastric or nasojejunal) is indicated from the fourth day when oral refeeding is not tolerated or the patient is sedated.
Prophylactic antibiotics and early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are not associated with improved outcomes.
Status epilepticus (SE) can be convulsive or non-convulsive.
Emergency treatment should be given when a convulsive seizure has lasted more than 5-10 minutes.
Poor prognostic factors for SE include old age, acute symptomatic cause and long duration.
Benzodiazepine administration, orally or rectally, can be useful in patients experiencing clusters of seizures.
Buccal midazolam is being increasingly used in place of rectal diazepam for the treatment of seizure clusters (acute repetitive seizures).
The aim when treating essential thrombocythemia (ET) is to reduce the risk of thrombosis and bleeding, and to alleviate symptoms.
Treatment is tailored according to the risk of thrombosis or bleeding in the individual patient.
All patients should receive interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, particularly smoking cessation advice.
Patients at the lowest level of risk (age < 60 years, no history of thrombosis, JAK2 V617F-negative, no cardiovascular risk factors) can be managed by observation alone. Other low-risk patients should receive low-dose aspirin.
High-risk patients should receive cytoreductive therapy in addition to aspirin. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) should be considered as first-line therapy. Options for second-line therapy include anagrelide, interferon-alpha and busulfan.
Patients should be monitored for signs of treatment failure, which may include elevated platelet or white blood cell counts, burdensome symptoms and clinical events such as thrombosis or bleeding.
In one trial, the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, reduced the incidence of prostate cancer by about one-quarter over 4 years and also relieved symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), but slightly increased the incidence of high-grade cancer. Finasteride produced similar results.
Men should be advised / supported to lower lipid profiles, address obesity and increase exercise and fitness as part of a strategy to cut the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated death, and, possibly, prostate cancer.
The pancreas is 6-8 inches long and lies behind the stomach between the duodenum on the right and the center of the spleen on the left. It produces digestive enzymes, bicarbonate and insulin.
The biliary system comprises the organs and ducts that store bile and release it into the duodenum.
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth highest cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA.
Gallstones are prevalent worldwide and a considerable cause of morbidity and mortality.
Improvements in therapy for systemic cancer have resulted in an increase in the number of patients living long enough to develop symptomatic brain metastasis. It is likely that this trend will continue. Therefore, new strategies to prevent and treat brain metastases will become increasingly important.
Patients with a new diagnosis of brain metastasis should be systemically restaged as appropriate for their primary tumor.
Although the average prognosis for an individual with brain metastasis is poor, selected patients will benefit significantly from aggressive local therapy or judicious use of chemotherapy.
Depression occurs at a range of severities and may often be experienced in combination with other mental disorders such as anxiety; this can be an additional source of difficulty in diagnosis.
The diagnosis of depression is problematic - primarily in relation to the validity of distinguishing this state from normal human responses to loss and trauma.
Widely used diagnostic criteria enable agreement about the types of symptoms and the level of severity and persistence that comprise depressive disorder.
Depression severity is an important part of its clinical description (informing treatment decisions), and is based on the number of symptoms and their severity and effect on function.
Depression may involve single or recurrent episodes or it may be persistent; it may also be characterized by particular features (psychotic, melancholic) or patterns of onset (seasonal, postnatal).
The diagnosis of depression involves the presence of at least one core symptom together with other associated symptoms that are experienced most of the day, for most days, for a period of at least 2 weeks.
The prevalence of diabetes is increasing around the world, reflecting the massive societal changes in dietary habits, with energy overconsumption, an increase in sedentary lifestyle and obesity.
Different ethnic groups are particularly susceptible to diabetes.
The obesity epidemic is impacting on earlier development of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
The impact of diabetes and its complications will have the greatest burden on resource-poor nations with limited access to insulin and renal replacement (dialysis and transplantation).
Patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL who are not candidates for potentially curative allogeneic stem cell transplantation have poor outcomes with conventional chemotherapy regimens.
A clinical trial should be regarded as the standard of care for patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL.
Single-agent therapies and novel agents have demonstrated activity in PTCL. Although the duration of response is typically short, these are options for patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplantation.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors are often active in patients with AITL because of epigenetic mutations.
Brentuximab vedotin is highly active in ALCL and has demonstrated activity in CD30-expressing subsets of PTCL. Neurotoxicity is a frequent adverse event and requires careful monitoring.
Heart failure (HF) is a disease of response to injury, which is initially appropriate and becomes inappropriate.
Inappropriate non-cardiac responses include activation of a variety of hormonal reflexes (vasoconstriction, and sodium and water retention). Reversal of these inappropriate responses is critical to the management of HF.
Remodeling is a cardiac response that is initially appropriate and becomes inappropriate as the heart enlarges excessively and hypertrophies.
Symptoms develop in HF as a result of a complex web of interactions, involving not only the heart, hormonal changes and skeletal muscle, but also the vasculature (especially the endothelium), lungs and other organs.
In addition to the classification of HF by clinical manifestation (acute vs chronic, systolic vs diastolic), etiology and precipitants (addressed in other chapters), HF can be classified by clinical stage (the course of the disease) and functional class (functional status based on symptom severity and exercise capacity).
The patient must be carefully examined, noting acne lesion type, extent and severity as well as acne scarring.
The clinician must have a thorough discussion about the disease with the patient to dispel myths, instill realistic expectations and improve adherence.
Early effective therapy is likely to reduce the significant clinical and psychological morbidity associated with acne.
Patients with acne who have associated social or psychological problems should also be referred for specialist treatment.
A clinical history must be carefully taken, including family history, previous treatments and response to therapy (see Table 3.3, page 19 ).
Prescribers should be aware of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Propionibacterium acnes and the potential link to reduced clinical response. Studies have shown that the improvement in acne achieved with oral antibiotics plus a topical retinoid or retinoid/benzoyl peroxide (BPO) fixed combination can be maintained with continued use of the topical retinoid or retinoid/BPO combination after the antibiotic is discontinued.
Patients with severe nodulocystic acne, an unusual variant of acne or an underlying endocrinological problem should be referred urgently to a dermatologist for treatment with isotretinoin or hormonal therapy, as appropriate.
Patients with moderate acne that has failed to respond to treatment, those at risk of developing scarring, and pregnant women with acne should also be referred to a dermatologist.
Management of patients with advanced or metastatic disease is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.
Management of both local and distant metastatic disease should be considered.
Perioperative chemotherapy should be considered for suitable patients with high-risk bladder-confined disease, but preoperative chemotherapy is preferred where possible.
Combination chemoradiotherapy can be an alternative to cystectomy for the management of locally advanced disease.
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy can provide excellent outcomes for some patients with advanced or metastatic disease.
Radiation therapy to the primary or appropriate metastatic sites can provide useful palliation.
Combination chemoradiotherapy to the bladder is best reserved for patients being treated with curative intent.
The intent of treatment for patients with metastatic disease is optimal palliation (improved quality of life with or without prolonging survival). The benefits of any treatment must outweigh the risks.
Decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), which are conducted in a study participant's home using digital tools, offer a way to make better-informed decisions about the efficacy of new therapies.
DCTs have a number of potential benefits, including faster participant recruitment, improved participant retention in the trial, greater control and convenience for participants and increased diversity and inclusion (exempli gratia because it is easier to enroll in the first place).
DCTs are characterized by two core questions: where are the data collected (exempli gratia how remote is the study?) and how are the data collected (exempli gratia how virtual is the study? How much of the data is collected using digital tools versus needing human interaction?)?
Digital measurement tools collect real-world data only when used outside of a clinical trial. When data from these tools are collected as part of a clinical trial protocol, they are collecting data during activities of daily living. But it is incorrect to call these data 'real-world data' as this term has a specific regulatory meaning.
The commonest aggressive B-cell lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Most DLBCL express CD20, which is the target for rituximab; approximately 50% of DLBCL are curable with R-CHOP.
Burkitt lymphoma and the c-Myc -positive DLBCL subtype have high proliferation rates and should be treated with sequential chemotherapy incorporating central nervous system prophylaxis.
Patients who relapse require salvage chemotherapy and, if chemosensitive, will benefit from high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell rescue.
Corticosteroid joint injections provide moderate short-term pain relief in a number of joints.
Injections should always be used in conjunction with muscle-strengthening exercises to take full advantage of the steroid-induced reduction in pain.
The molecular status of, at least, EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and BRAF must be tested in patients with advanced stage NSCLC to determine suitability for TKI therapy.
PD-L1 expression also needs to be tested in patients with advanced NSCLC to guide immunotherapy decisions.
Individuals with advanced breast cancer should undergo molecular testing to assess, at least, PIK3CA (ER+ mBC), germinal BRCA mutations ( HER2 − mBC), HER2 amplification, MSI and NTRK.
Knowledge of PD-L1 expression is also required to guide immunotherapy in TNBC.
Chromosomal instability accounts for around 85% of all CRCs, while MSI accounts for around 15%. CIMP, which shows overlap with the MSI pathway, is found in around 17% of CRCs.
The minimum testing required to determine whether anti-EGFR therapy may be of benefit in CRC is extended RAS testing of KRAS and NRAS: codons 12 and 13 of exon 2; codons 59 and 61 of exon 3; and codons 117 and 146 of exon 4.
The utility of assessing several other genes ( ESR1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2 ) and the value of assessing TMB are currently being investigated in breast cancer.
Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations - including BRAF, NRAS and KIT - documented in all melanoma subtypes.
Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations. BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma; however, these responses may be short.
Knowledge of mutations affecting KRAS, MET, RET and NTRK may also help select treatment for advanced NSCLC.
The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors has demonstrated improved durable response rates over a single-agent BRAF inhibitor.
Mucosal or acral melanomas with activating mutations or amplifications in KIT may be sensitive to c-KIT inhibitors.
The majority of GISTs have KIT mutations that result in constitutive activation of the RTK, c-KIT.
TKIs have some effectiveness in GISTs and non-GI sarcomas.
