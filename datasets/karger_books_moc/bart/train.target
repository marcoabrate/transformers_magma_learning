The four main types of leukemia are acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The acute leukemias are predominantly characterized by the uncontrolled growth of immature poorly differentiated cells that are blocked from further differentiation. The chronic leukemias are characterized by maturing proliferative later-stage cells. The main reason for the development of leukemia is the accumulation of gene mutations over time. Chromosomal translocations are common. The identification of chromosomal abnormalities aids treatment stratification in patients. New-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the discovery of mutations in leukemia. Malignant clonal subpopulations identified at diagnosis have also been identified at relapse. Prognosis depends on the genetic abnormalities involved, as well as other clinical factors.

Despite increasing research on short- and long-term outcomes of anorexia, the disease still has a relatively poor prognosis; the mortality rate is the highest of all psychiatric disorders, although it has decreased in recent years. Although results from long-term studies support optimism for most patients with eating disorders, approximately 30% of patients with bulimia and atypical eating disorders remain ill at 10-20 years following presentation. Anorexia can have serious effects on reproductive functioning and the health of neonates. Bulimia usually persists for several years, and associated medical complications can result in intermittent hospitalization.

Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency should be considered in patients with signs/symptoms and laboratory findings of chronic hemolytic anemia (including those with mild anemia), reticulocytosis, jaundice, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, gallstones and splenomegaly. The diagnosis of PK deficiency is made by measuring PK enzymatic activity in red blood cell lysates by spectrophotometric assay. The diagnosis should be confirmed by the demonstration of known causative PKLR mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous presentations.

Normal mature red blood cells (RBCs) rely on the breakdown of glucose via the glycolytic pathway to produce energy. The hexose monophosphate shunt protects RBCs from oxidant damage. Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency affects the penultimate step of the glycolytic pathway, impairing the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and reducing the amount of energy produced by RBCs. PK deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most common glycolytic defect associated with hemolysis.

Diagnostic paracentesis is mandatory in any patient with new ascites. Salt restriction and diuretics are effective in most patients with ascites. Repeated large-volume paracentesis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be required for refractory cases. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for varices. If these are present, prophylactic treatment with beta-blockers is recommended. Acute variceal bleeding is best treated with endoscopic techniques; however, pharmacotherapy also has a limited role. Hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. Lactulose, rifaximin and correction of precipitating factors are the mainstays of treatment.

Natural history studies suggest that life expectancy of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is reduced by 6-7 years compared with unaffected individuals, and comorbidities further increase the risk of mortality in people with MS. The average time from disease onset to mortality is 48 years. Early introduction of disease-modifying therapy may positively affect long-term mortality. Palliative care offers patients improved quality of life in the later stages of the disease. Advance planning can help people with MS achieve the control they need in late disease.

The osteoarthritis (OA) phenotype represents a common endpoint of multiple insults that result in failure of the joint. The findings of genome-wide association studies and research into the epigenetics of OA have the potential to identify new etiologic pathways and OA phenotypes, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The risk factors differ for incidence and progression. There are multiple potential peripheral sources of pain in the pathological OA joint, but the role of spinal and central pain pathways has not been well explored.

Physiological and genetic influences that promoted survival of our ancestors now promote obesity and comorbid disease. Genetic influences act alongside environmental factors to promote obesity. Transformation of our food habits has been a key factor in the increase of obesity and diabetes: energy-dense processed food is readily available in bigger and cheaper portions than ever before. Most causes of adult obesity are within the grasp of an individual to control, but babies and children rely on their parents and carers to provide an appropriate environment. Iatrogenic causes of obesity should be considered. The effect on weight of managing comorbid conditions is important, particularly diabetes in which weight gain is potentially catastrophic.

Health professionals and patients need support to understand the issues around biosimilars and to feel confident using them. Many different support materials are available to help health professionals talk to colleagues and patients about biosimilars. Around half of European countries have incentives for physicians to prescribe biosimilars. The regulatory requirements for biosimilars mean that it may not be possible to compare a biosimilar with the originator or with other biosimilars. In this scenario, formulary decisions are driven by price and convenience.

Nine biological therapies are now licensed for the treatment of RA. These block cytokines or their receptors (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin [IL]-1 and IL-6), deplete B cells or interfere with T cell activation. Biologics are expensive drugs, produced from living cells, that require parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. They slow joint damage more effectively than traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients vary in their response to biologics, presumably reflecting important inter-patient differences in disease pathogenesis and drug pharmacokinetics. Prolonged experience will be required to provide a true therapeutic ratio and an accurate economic evaluation of these drugs. A major research agenda relates to how to target these drugs to the patients who will derive most benefit from them (personalized medicine).

Refractory asthma is characterized by uncontrolled symptoms and/or frequent exacerbations despite maximal inhaled medication including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Refractory asthma is present in less than 5% of people with asthma. The first step in assessing refractory asthma is to assess adherence to current treatment. Before making a diagnosis of refractory asthma other conditions such as COPD and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis should be excluded. Assessment of airway inflammation is a very useful step for guiding treatment in refractory asthma.

Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) typically manifests as visual hallucinations. Auditory, tactile and olfactory hallucinations are less common. Psychotic symptoms may be present as part of a delirium. Behaviors associated with sleep may be difficult to distinguish from psychotic symptoms. Vivid dreams may be perceived as real, and brief episodes of dream continuation on awakening cannot always be distinguished from PDP. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disease or major depression may have psychotic symptoms from these disorders rather than PDP. Comorbid psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety work synergistically with the psychosis, each making the other worse. The Clinical Global Impressions Scale is a simple short tool for assessing PDP in clinical practice; it reflects the actual clinical evaluation.

Supportive care is aimed at managing the complications of treatment for lymphoma or of the lymphoma itself. Effective supportive care involves a multidisciplinary and holistic approach, with consideration of psychosocial and physical factors. Effective analgesia and antiemesis has revolutionized supportive care, but fatigue remains debilitating, common and hard to manage. Bone-marrow suppression is a common complication of lymphoma therapy and results in anemia, a low platelet count with bleeding, and a low white cell count and infection risk. Anemia may be treated with recombinant human erythropoietin or blood transfusions. If sufficiently severe, a low platelet count may be treated with platelet transfusions. The treatment of neutropenic sepsis is a medical emergency and requires prompt assessment by a medical team with rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Tumor lysis syndrome is a serious complication of aggressive lymphomas. Recognizing patients at high risk and implementing effective preventive measures is the mainstay of treatment.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop into terminally differentiated myeloid and lymphoid cells through intermediate progenitor cells. The lineage of hematopoietic cells has been extensively studied using flow cytometry and traditional transplantation techniques. The precursors of fully differentiated blood cells have intermediate properties between the final cells and the HSCs. Developmental potential becomes increasingly restricted. The self-renewal of HSCs is a highly regulated process that provides a continuous source of blood cells in adult humans. Cytokines such as interferon-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor provide signals to HSCs to proliferate and differentiate. Transcription factors are also vital in the regulation of hematopoiesis.

Verification evaluates the capture and transference of a sensor-generated signal into collected data. The goal of verification testing is to ensure that the sensor is accurate, precise, consistent and uniform. This usually does not require human subjects. Validation ensures that the technology is measuring what it is intended to measure. It almost always requires human subjects. Validation comprises two types of testing:Analytic validation: does the device process the raw data to produce the measure of interest (exempli gratia convert raw accelerometry data to gait speed in a particular patient population)?Clinical validation: do changes to the measure of interest predict future clinical outcomes (exempli gratia is gait speed a marker of disease progression)?The level of validation associated with a digital measure should be sufficient to support its context of use, a regulatory term that refers to a description of how the tool is used and where it is applied.There is increasing overlap between clinical research and care.

The immediate arrest of hemorrhage depends on vasoconstriction together with the adhesion and aggregation of platelets at the site of vessel injury. The coagulation system is activated by tissue factor expression. This binds and converts factor (F)VII to FVIIa, which initiates a catalytic series of reactions leading to the rapid generation of small amounts of thrombin. Trace concentrations of thrombin trigger the explosive generation of a much larger quantity of thrombin by activating FXI, FVIII and FV in a positive feedback loop. Thrombin further promotes the stability of the platelet-fibrin hemostatic plug by activating platelets, FXIII (cross-linking fibrin strands) and thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor.

Cigarettes deliver a 'bolus' of nicotine to the brain within seconds of each puff. Smokers absorb an average 1-2 mg of nicotine per cigarette (more when cigarettes are smoked more intensively). Cigarettes also deliver tar, containing potent carcinogens, and carbon monoxide. Smokers' intake of tar and nicotine from so-called 'low-tar' cigarettes is not substantially lower than the intake from higher-tar cigarettes. Nicotine is rapidly metabolized and excreted; its concentration in the blood halves every 90-120 minutes. Almost all the nicotine is cleared over a day of abstinence. The nicotine metabolite cotinine is eliminated much more slowly and is present in all body fluids, including saliva and urine; measurement of saliva or urine cotinine content is therefore a useful means of assessing total nicotine intake over the past few days.

Smokers' intake of tar and nicotine from so-called 'low-tar' cigarettes is not substantially lower than the intake from higher-tar cigarettes. Nicotine is rapidly metabolized and excreted; its concentration in the blood halves every 90-120 minutes. Almost all the nicotine is cleared over a day of abstinence. The nicotine metabolite cotinine is eliminated much more slowly and is present in all body fluids, including saliva and urine; measurement of saliva or urine cotinine content is therefore a useful means of assessing total nicotine intake over the past few days.
Sepsis should be treated immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics; intravenous fluids and oxygen should be given as needed. The high risk of bleeding in uncontrolled acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) represents a medical emergency. To prevent coagulopathy, anti-leukemic therapy should be initiated as soon as possible alongside meticulous supportive care. Tumor lysis syndrome may arise spontaneously but is more frequent in the early days of chemotherapy, when massive numbers of tumor cells are being destroyed. All patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome should be given intravenous fluids to maintain good diuresis. Both allopurinol and rasburicase can be used as prophylaxis in tumor lysis syndrome depending on the patient's risk level. However, they should not be used together. Hyperleukocytosis is a frequent finding in both chronic and acute leukemias, but leukostasis tends to be more common in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Rapid reductions in white blood cell counts can be achieved with leukapheresis, but concomitant chemotherapy is needed to maintain leukodepletion. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide has led to impressive improvements in survival rates in APML, but their use may be associated with the development of differentiation syndrome. This can be managed with intravenous dexamethasone, 10 mg twice a day. An increased incidence of thromboses in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is probably linked to treatment with regimens containing L -asparaginase. To help reduce the incidence of thromboses, placement of central venous catheters should be avoided during the induction phase of treatment with these regimens.

Persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) is defined as pain at or close to the site of surgical incision that persists beyond the expected healing period. The incidence of PPSP varies from about 10% for very limited peripheral surgery, such as inguinal hernia repair or joint replacement, to 10-30% for mastectomy and up to 50% for thoracotomy and amputation. Nerve injury plays an important role in pathogenesis, but genetics, pre-existing pain and severity of postoperative pain are also risk factors, in addition to cancer treatment and possible psychosocial factors. Patients who catastrophize, which increases postoperative pain and opioid analgesic use, may benefit from psychological services such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Effective acute pain control may be preventive for PPSP - for example, intra- and postoperative use of epidural analgesia can prevent PPSP following some operations. Pharmacotherapy is based on the study results of neuropathic drugs used to treat pain caused by other types of nerve injury. Tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants are first-line drugs. Peripheral nerve stimulation is emerging as a possible treatment option for severe PPSP. Although spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has not been found to be successful for amputation pain, early data indicate positive outcomes for dorsal root (DRG) stimulation.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly causes kidney disease, which can be severe and requires immunosuppression. Vasculitis is common in the elderly and can be successfully treated if diagnosed early. Long-term treatment is usually needed for both vasculitis and SLE with kidney involvement. Atheromatous renal vascular disease is very common and reflects widespread arterial pathology.

Electrolyte disturbances are very common and often iatrogenic. All electrolye disturbances require an accurate assessment of fluid balance. Intake and excretion of solutes, and drugs, must be considered when trying to identify causes. Correction should generally be cautious.

The most essential components in diagnosis are suspicion of lymphoma from the clinical presentation and the taking of an adequate biopsy. New molecular and cellular techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of lymphoma. Immunophenotyping and immunohistochemistry analyze the expression of proteins on the cell surface (or sometimes within the cytoplasm or nucleus). Karyotyping and fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) reveal the chromosomal changes in the cell. Gene-expression profiling has led to subtyping cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and may improve the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. An increased understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of lymphomas may lead to improved targeting of treatment.

Multiple sclerosis does not affect fertility. The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) does not affect MS, and MS does not affect the efficacy of the OCP. Ideally, pregnancy in patients with MS should be planned and managed with both obstetric and neurological input. Pregnancy may result in reduced relapse risk, especially in the third trimester, but does not affect the overall progression of MS. Relapses during pregnancy should be treated on a case-by-case basis with specialist input. Although data are limited, there is no evidence of teratogenicity with interferon beta (IFNbeta), glatiramer acetate or natalizumab therapy. In general, IFNbeta and glatiramer acetate therapy should be stopped before pregnancy is confirmed. In patients with highly active MS, an argument can be made to maintain glatiramer acetate provided the patient is cognizant of the potential risks. Methotrexate and teriflunomide must not be used before conception in male or female patients. Teriflunomide has a long half-life and must be appropriately 'washed out' before conception. There are insufficient data regarding fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate in pregnancy; however, cessation of these therapies before conception is recommended. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in patients with MS who have significant immobility. The ability to breast-feed is not affected unless the patient has significant motor impairment. Disease-modifying therapies should in general not be used when breast-feeding.

Site of recurrence, extent, time to recurrence and evaluation of comorbidities are critical determinants of prognosis and treatment. It is essential to set clearly defined goals of therapy for both the patient and healthcare professionals. Systemic treatment can improve symptoms and, in some cases, prolong survival. Oncological emergencies must be anticipated and recognized. Effective pain management is almost always possible.

Insufficient understanding of the pathology of this heterogeneous group of rare diseases, together with a lack of randomized clinical trial data, has hindered progress in the treatment of PTCL, resulting in wide variation in practice. The use of intensive treatment strategies for nodal PTCL does not appear to improve outcomes. Improved survival with brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP chemotherapy in the ECHELON-2 trial heralded a new treatment standard in ALCL; however, the benefit in other PTCL subtypes is unclear. Extranodal PTCL has a dismal outcome with CHOP-based chemotherapy; alternative therapeutic chemotherapy strategies focused on distinct subtypes are therefore required.

Depression is a common mental disorder, affecting around 5% of the population over a 12-month period, with 10-15% of people likely to experience depression over the course of their lifetime. Women are nearly twice as likely to experience depression as men, and depression more commonly affects people who are divorced or separated, or who have experienced violence or abuse, as well as those experiencing socioeconomic adversity. In high- and middle-income countries, depression is the leading cause of disability and, primarily due to changes in demographic and disease distribution patterns, its contribution to global disability is projected to increase over future decades. Depression is related to a range of biological, sociocultural and psychological factors, and although there are strong links between adversity and its onset, these factors are not necessarily predictive of depression for individuals. At least half of all people affected by depression experience more than a single episode, and the risk of recurrence increases with each successive episode.

Chronic kidney disease is very common, especially the early stages. Early interventions can prevent a progressive decline in kidney function and complications. Blood pressure control is crucial, and very low targets should be set. Cardiovascular risk factors need aggressive management. Anemia and bone disease may require treatment before dialysis is necessary.

As advances in technology enable digital tools to gather ever larger amounts of high-resolution personal health information, core principles of medical and research ethics must be integrated at every step, beginning in the design phase. The line between 'personalization' and 'surveillance' is thin. As a result, and given the near impossibility to 'de-identify' mass amounts of data, it becomes more and more important to know who has access to sensitive data and under what conditions. Common practices in the consumer technology industry for obtaining agreement to corporate terms of service, including privacy policies, are not sufficient or appropriate for obtaining informed consent from users, be they patients receiving care or participants in health research. (When was the last time you read an end user license agreement for a website or app you use?) The field of digital medicine must develop innovative ways of ensuring that the values of respect, privacy and trust are not lost in the pursuit of better data. It is critical to ensure that the technologies are worthy of the trust we place in them.

The field of digital medicine must develop innovative ways of ensuring that the values of respect, privacy and trust are not lost in the pursuit of better data. It is critical to ensure that the technologies are worthy of the trust we place in them.
The prevalence of urinary tract symptoms increases with age, and urinary incontinence is a frequent cause of institutionalization of the elderly. Identification of the cause is more important in the elderly than in younger patients, as elderly patients are likely to have multiple coexisting symptoms and pathologies. Polypharmacy may be a contributory factor. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in elderly women. Treatment of persistent UTI is with low-dose vaginal estrogen and prophylactic antibiotics. Lower urinary tract problems are common in pregnancy and usually resolve after delivery. Vaginal delivery, especially associated with a long second stage of labor, forceps-assisted delivery and high birth weight, may damage the pelvic floor innervation and result in postnatal incontinence. UTIs are common in pregnancy and are associated with preterm delivery and low birth weight. Pregnant women should therefore be screened for UTIs at all antenatal visits, and UTIs treated accordingly. Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF), which results in vaginal leakage of urine, is the most common fistula to cause urinary incontinence. In developed countries, VVF may be caused by pelvic malignancy, radiotherapy, trauma and gynecologic/urologic instrumentation. Obstetric trauma during unsupervised labor is a common cause of VVF in developing countries. Dye studies and imaging are required to determine the site of a fistula. Many fistulas heal spontaneously over 6-12 weeks with conservative management such as bladder draining or ureteric stenting. Premature surgery is likely to be unsuccessful because of tissue inflammation and sloughing.

The medications commonly prescribed to people with PD can exacerbate or trigger psychosis, particularly visual hallucinations. For this reason, medications should always be reviewed in people developing PD psychosis (PDP). Cumulative anticholinergic load may be important in people on multiple medications. Impaired visual acuity or concurrent eye conditions may increase the risk of visual hallucinations and should be addressed. The study of genetic relationships with PDP is in its infancy and most genetic associations are not yet known. LRRK2, the most common monogenic cause of PD, generally confers a more benign prognosis than GBA -associated PD. People with PD and GBA mutations are at increased risk of dementia and psychosis.

An arrhythmic cause should be considered in younger patients presenting with 'epilepsy' - a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is mandatory. ECG changes may be intermittent; a normal baseline ECG may not exclude these conditions. Several forms of congenital long QT syndrome have been described, the most well-characterized of which - LQT1, LQT2 and LQT3 - each have distinct clinical outcomes, ECG appearances and triggers. Brugada syndrome is characterized by sudden death due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation; ECG changes may be intermittent, but an abnormality resembling incomplete or complete right bundle branch block pattern with persistent ST elevation in the precordial chest leads (V1-V3) is diagnostic. Most cases of acquired long QT syndrome are drug-related. Patients with known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy require cardiological assessment. In many cases, screening of family members is mandatory and, if available, referral to a specialized genetics clinic should be made.

More than 70% of patients with choledochal cysts have an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction. Caroli's disease is a congenital condition resulting in multiple segmental dilations of intrahepatic ducts. Liver flukes and roundworms may cause Oriental cholangiohepatitis. AIDS cholangiopathy may result in right upper quadrant abdominal pain, biliary strictures and papillary stenosis. Up to 70% of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) may have ulcerative colitis. Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for PSC with end-stage liver disease.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) exists as immune-mediated (autoimmune) and congenital forms. TTP is mediated by a deficiency of ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor, causing multisystem microthrombi. Congenital TTP has two incidence peaks, first in childhood and then in adulthood, typically in pregnancy.
A logical process for assessing breast pain or masses will greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy. Triple assessment - clinical examination plus imaging plus cytological or histopathological examination - represents the diagnostic gold standard. All suspicious findings on MRI require pathological confirmation. No test is pathognomonic. Clinical judgment has high value. Breast screening programs have modest utility. Their greatest value may be in increasing patient self-awareness and in the improved organization of clinical services. Breast self-examination can no longer be recommended, though women should be aware of normal physiological changes and thus be alerted to the first chance observation of a pathological change.

DNA carries the genetic code in the form of sequences of codons; each codon codes for a specific amino acid or a stop signal. Non-coding DNA, which is much more abundant than coding DNA (99% versus 1%), has important functional roles; promoters, silencers, enhancers and insulators are examples of regulatory elements of non-coding DNA. Different types of genetic mutation occur. A mutation may result in the production of a protein with altered functional ability, or it may prevent the protein from being produced. The most frequent genetic alterations associated with cancer include: base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and rearrangements. TP53 mutations are the most frequent mutations in patients with cancer. Mutations affect the ability of cellular tumor protein p53 to regulate cell division and survival. Mutations affecting the MAPK signaling pathway are also implicated in cancers. Dysregulation of the pathway results in increased cell division and survival.

Proteinuria and hematuria should always be investigated. Proteinuria should be quantified by means of an albumin:creatinine ratio or 24-hour collections, since the result will guide management. Hematuria may have a medical or surgical cause, and this should be assessed before starting investigations. Serum creatinine alone is an unreliable guide to kidney function; an assessment of glomerular filtration rate is more useful. No fall in serum creatinine during pregnancy can indicate significant renal functional impairment.

The PTCLs are a group of highly heterogeneous aggressive malignancies that arise from the transformation of mature post-thymic T cells and natural killer cells. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies PTCLs into nodal, extranodal and leukemia types, each with multiple disease entities. PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) is the most common subtype, reflecting the need for more precise characterization of these lymphomas. Genetic analyses are helping to refine this category further. The primary nodal PTCLs are anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), which may be positive or negative for the fusion protein anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK + /ALK − ), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Extranodal PTCLs are less common than nodal PTCLs and include enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL). Classification has been largely based on morphologic assessment, although the 2016 update to the WHO classification incorporated recent advances in the understanding of the cell of origin and the molecular signatures of particular types of PTCL. Genetic lesions are also being identified but few are entity-defining markers.

Depression is about twice as common among women as men as a result of sociocultural, psychological and biological factors. Women are at particular risk of developing depression during the perinatal period - the time from conception through to the end of the first postnatal year. Antenatal depression is a predictor of subsequent postnatal depression. There are risks associated with the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy. Only small amounts of the SSRIs pass into breast milk, and breastfeeding is considered safe. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder affects up to 5% of women; its assessment requires the presence of symptoms over a number of menstrual cycles. Some women do not respond to antidepressants during the perimenopause, and the addition of hormone replacement therapy to an antidepressant may help.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder affects up to 5% of women; its assessment requires the presence of symptoms over a number of menstrual cycles. Some women do not respond to antidepressants during the perimenopause, and the addition of hormone replacement therapy to an antidepressant may help.
Most patients with gritty, itchy or watery eyes do not need urgent referral, unless serious abnormalities are found when taking a history or on examination. You can treat many patients with these conditions yourself, as described in the chapter. It is important to use a blue light and fluorescein drops to examine the cornea to exclude a corneal ulcer. Occasionally a viral dendritic corneal ulcer will present with a gritty or irritated eye (no pain is felt because the virus makes the eye numb). Always refer these patients urgently to an ophthalmologist and do not prescribe steroid eye drops. Remember to evert the upper eyelid in patients complaining of a 'gritty' feeling or foreign body sensation, to look for a foreign body under the lid.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and often reversible if diagnosed promptly. Recognition and management of volume depletion or overload is crucial in the early management of AKI. Patients require frequent re-assessment and measurement of physiological parameters (including urine output), and daily measurement of serum electrolytes. Drug doses often need to be modified. Acute tubular necrosis has no specific treatment other than volume control, and there is no benefit in the routine use of dopamine or furosemide. AKI is a risk factor for the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease.

Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal and recurrent attacks of facial pain that are sudden and unilateral, and follow the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Pain is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal ganglion or its branches. Medical management remains the first line of treatment. Carbamazepine, traditionally the drug of choice, is often replaced by gabapentin and pregabalin because of fewer side effects. Patients hospitalized because of the severity of pain may be effectively controlled by use of a subcutaneous infusion of lidocaine (lignocaine). Failed medical treatment is an indication for consideration of microvascular decompression or alternative techniques.

Type 1 diabetes results from an absolute deficiency of insulin. Osmotic symptoms at onset include thirst, polydipsia and polyuria. Environmental factors that cause the condition are unknown, but possibly include viral infection. Multiple inherited genetic factors influence both disease susceptibility and resistance. Autoimmune processes lead to beta cell destruction and a decline in beta cell mass.

Untreated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is associated with a high mortality rate; TTP should be treated as a medical emergency. Plasma exchange should be started without delay in an individual presenting with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in the absence of any other identifiable cause. Immune-mediated TTP is often associated with organ involvement, typically neurological and cardiac. Both are markers of poor prognosis and may identify higher-risk patients. Precipitating factors, such as HIV, autoimmune disease, drugs and pregnancy, should be excluded. Treatment should be tailored toward the underlying cause. Pretreatment samples should be sent for ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels. Plasma exchange should be started immediately afterward. Diagnosis of TTP is defined by an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL. A level of 10 IU/dL or higher is in keeping with atypical (complement-mediated) hemolytic uremic syndrome and other thrombotic microangiopathies. Immune-mediated TTP is confirmed with elevated anti-ADAMTS13 IgG, whereas these antibodies are absent in congenital TTP. Scoring systems such as PLASMIC can be a useful tool for predicting the likelihood of severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity, especially in settings where ADAMTS13 assays are not readily available. However, wherever possible, definitive confirmation of TTP should be based on analysis of ADAMTS13 activity.

Asthma exacerbations are one of the major causes of morbidity in asthma, resulting in loss of work time in adults or school absence in children, and emergency hospital presentation and admission. Causes of acute asthma include viral respiratory infections, acute allergen exposure, food allergies and some medications such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Acute exacerbations of asthma usually respond well to inhaled beta -agonists and a course of oral corticosteroid. After hospital admission, patients should receive appropriate medication, a written plan of what to do if their asthma worsens and a follow-up medical appointment for ongoing management and measurement of lung function.

Increasingly, prostate cancer is being diagnosed on the basis of a raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and subsequent investigation. PSA-based screening of asymptomatic men is controversial. A baseline PSA at age 40-55 years may assess a man's future risk of developing prostate cancer. More advanced disease can present with symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction, hematuria or ureteric obstruction. Bone metastases may cause bone pain or pathological fracture.

Exercise-induced asthma is defined as a transient increase in airway resistance that follows vigorous exercise. It appears to be more common in those with atopy and to be seen more often on exercise in very cold weather. Induction of exercise-induced asthma appears to be protective for further episodes for a period of several hours. Exercise testing or other direct or indirect challenges are used in diagnosis. In elite athletes, direct airway challenges may not reveal exercise-induced asthma, so indirect surrogate challenges must be used to confirm diagnosis.

Although asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders, it is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The clinical diagnosis of asthma is often based on the presence of symptoms, such as breathlessness (often episodic), wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. A key feature is variation of symptoms over time, especially diurnal variation. Objective measures of lung function are important in order to establish asthma as a diagnosis and to assess response to treatment. Measurement of bronchial responsiveness and allergy status can aid diagnosis as well as identify possible exacerbating factors. Attempts should be made to assess disease control to guide treatment. The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult in certain patient groups, particularly those who smoke and the very young or old.

Conventional systemic therapies can be extremely helpful in the short- and long-term management of psoriasis. Side effects of systemic therapies for psoriasis include myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Teratogenicity limits the use of methotrexate and acitretin. Close monitoring and adherence to guidelines are key to minimizing toxicity.

A stratified analysis (analysis of variance; ANOVA) gives a treatment effect, adjusting for baseline imbalances for continuous and score endpoints. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test compares treatments, adjusting for baseline imbalances for a binary endpoint, while the stratified logrank test does the same for a time-to-event endpoint. Linear regression (univariate analysis) and multiple regression (multivariate analysis) investigate the dependence of an outcome on baseline factors. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is an extension of ANOVA that can adjust for continuous covariates and for several covariates simultaneously when comparing treatments. ANCOVA can also be used to investigate treatment x covariate interactions. These statistical models can be incorporated into a single modeling framework that models the mean for continuous and score endpoints. Patient-to-patient variation is assumed to follow a normal distribution. The logistic model provides a corresponding framework for binary endpoints that models the odds for the event. The Cox model provides a corresponding framework for time-to-event endpoints that models the hazard rate.

Treatment-refractory MG is defined as disease that inadequately responds, or results in unacceptable adverse reactions, to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, or requires excessive amounts of potentially harmful agents or repeated rescue therapy. Patients with comorbidities that preclude the use of conventional treatments and/or who have frequent myasthenic crises are also considered to have refractory MG. Treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis (MG) is estimated to occur in approximately 10-15% of patients with generalized MG. Compared with non-refractory patients, treatment-refractory patients are more likely to be younger at disease onset, female, thymomatous and muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK)-antibody positive.

A wide regular QRS complex indicates ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise. All patients with a wide-complex tachycardia need emergency referral and admission. VT may occur in a structurally normal heart and tends to show characteristic electrocardiogram and clinical features. Catheter ablation is curative for normal heart VT, but palliative for scar-related VT. Wide QRS tachycardia always requires further investigation and referral to an arrhythmia specialist.

Eating disorders are more common in women than men, but disordered eating is increasingly being seen in male athletes and performers. Both anorexia and bulimia are more prevalent in Western industrialized nations of white ethnicity and in middle- to upper-class women, but the disorders are now affecting more diverse populations in terms of ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Bulimia is more common in adults than teenagers, while anorexia is more common in adolescent girls. Disordered eating is probably more common than classic eating disorders in adolescents and young adults.

Bifurcation of the hepatic duct is the most common site for cholangiocarcinoma. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is the major risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Benign biliary obstruction may increase cancer antigen 19.9 levels. Biliary papillomatosis lesions are diffuse and multiple, with the abnormal biliary epithelium producing a large amount of mucus. Rare tumors include biliary cystadenoma and primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a frequent cause of hospital admission and its incidence has been increasing in recent decades. Gallstones are the leading cause of AP in most countries, followed by alcohol. Hypertriglyceridemia and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are also common causes. Mutation in the PRSS1 gene is a rare cause of AP, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Other genetic mutations are generally considered as cofactors in the development of AP. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma must be ruled out in patients without an evident cause of AP who are aged more than 50 years, with weight loss and/or a recent diagnosis of diabetes.

Predictive biomarkers are urgently needed to direct precision immunotherapy. Tumor mutation burden is a promising predictor of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors but requires further study, including the use of non-invasive tools such as plasma-circulating tumor DNA analysis. Predictive biomarkers for immune-related toxicity are also needed. Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy are being explored to see whether responses may be augmented.

Ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (HF). Arterial hypertension is an important cause of new presentation but also a powerful precipitant of acute worsening of existing HF. Aortic valve disease is an important cause of HF. Surgery is the best therapy for suitable candidates; assessment of severity in the context of existing cardiac dysfunction can be challenging, but helps to define individuals who would benefit most from surgery. Surgery is always required for organic mitral valve regurgitation, but if the cause is functional then surgery may not help and may even be deleterious. All patients with a new diagnosis of cardiomyopathy require cardiologic referral. Cardiotoxicity is one of the most serious side effects of cancer therapy; cardiac function must be assessed at baseline and during therapy. Timely detection and treatment of cardiac and non-cardiac factors that may worsen HF, and in some cases preventative measures, constitute an inherent part of modern HF management.

Timely detection and treatment of cardiac and non-cardiac factors that may worsen HF, and in some cases preventative measures, constitute an inherent part of modern HF management.
Ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (HF). Arterial hypertension is an important cause of new presentation but also a powerful precipitant of acute worsening of existing HF. Aortic valve disease is an important cause of HF. Surgery is the best therapy for suitable candidates; assessment of severity in the context of existing cardiac dysfunction can be challenging, but helps to define individuals who would benefit most from surgery. Surgery is always required for organic mitral valve regurgitation, but if the cause is functional then surgery may not help and may even be deleterious.

Initial symptoms and signs of a brain tumor are often vague or non-specific; many patients will have a normal neurological examination. Headache, the most common symptom of a brain tumor, is also the most common neurological complaint in the general population. Therefore, attention to specific features of a patient's headache should guide the clinician's index of suspicion and diagnostic evaluation. Seizures occur in one-third of patients and any adult with new onset seizures should be evaluated for an underlying brain tumor. Although neuroimaging may suggest a specific diagnosis, tissue should be obtained for pathological review in all patients before instituting any therapy. The only exception to this rule is the patient with a typical infiltrating pontine glioma, where the risks of surgery outweigh the benefit. Ideally, the clinician should review images and pathology information directly with the radiologist and neuropathologist. Improvements in neuroimaging may be most useful in assessing response to newer therapies, particularly targeted molecular strategies that may be cytostatic.

No biosimilar has been approved for which comparable immunogenicity in regulatory studies has not predicted real-world outcomes in more than 10 years of European experience. For epoetin, comparable composite outcomes were found in more than 13 000 patients treated with reference or biosimilar epoetins and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which reassured the regulator about the safety of biosimilar epoetin for symptomatic chemotherapy-induced anemia. The design of the four-arm Pioneer study allowed data collection for participants who switched from originator to biosimilar filgrastim or vice versa on each round of chemotherapy, in anticipation of regulatory requirements to demonstrate interchangeability.

Meningiomas are the most common intracranial neoplasm. Most are low-grade and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic meningiomas may not require specific treatment, and can be observed by serial CT or MRI. Surgery is the principal therapeutic modality for symptomatic meningiomas, but many meningiomas cannot be completely resected because of their location in high-risk areas. Radiotherapy can achieve long-term growth stabilization of recurrent or enlarging meningiomas. There are no effective medical therapies for recurrent or malignant meningiomas.

Agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate what manufacturers claim a product can do (rather than what a product actually does), which means that a product can be considered a 'device' (and regulated) or not a device (and not regulated) through only a change in words and no change to hardware or software. Digital measurement tools that are considered a 'device' are regulated by the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). Digital tools that support drug applications (exempli gratia those that capture digital endpoint data) are regulated by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Increasingly more manufacturers of digital products are considering the 'de novo' regulatory pathway so they do not have to deal with predicates and can develop an application that better reflects the software's unique characteristics. The regulatory frameworks for digital tools are in flux, and developers should continue to read upcoming guidance, comment on the revisions in the public docket and engage in the process to improve regulatory decision-making.

Three classic syndromes of liver dysfunction are associated with late pregnancy: acute fatty liver, hypertension/eclampsia-related dysfunction and HELLP syndrome, but considerable overlap exists between them. Cholestasis of pregnancy is a recurrent disorder which is associated with increased fetal mortality. Pregnancy is surprisingly well tolerated by women with chronic liver disease.

The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system. Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord, the micturition center in the midbrain and the somatic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Voiding requires a coordinated contraction of the detrusor (bladder smooth musculature), simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary). Continence requires the converse.
Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is increasing in incidence in the immunocompetent population. The approach to diagnosis and treatment of PCNSL is significantly different from that for other primary brain tumors: - steroids should be avoided prior to obtaining diagnostic tissue - stereotactic biopsy should be used for tissue diagnosis; complete resection is not indicated - optimal treatment includes methotrexate-based chemotherapy, with or without cranial radiotherapy - older patients should be treated with chemotherapy alone to avoid treatment-related dementia. Ideally, all patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL should be treated as part of a clinical trial or referred to an appropriate tertiary care center for evaluation and treatment.

Cancer pain is a nociceptive mosaic in which pain may arise from inflammation, tumor infiltration of nerves (neuropathic pain) or other tissues (visceral or somatic pain), treatment, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and from other psychological and environmental factors. Treatment of the cancer itself (by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery etc.) is a primary option in cancer pain management; however, such treatment may be the cause of pain (especially neuropathic pain). Opioids are the foundation for management of cancer pain of moderate to severe intensity, but other drugs should also be considered depending on the pain conditions and mechanisms involved (exempli gratia neuropathic, myofascial, arthritic); however, treatment of cancer pain should not rely on drugs alone, since there are many other options that will produce good results. Psychological therapies that promote 'self-help' strategies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and meditation/relaxation, as well as integrative treatments such as massage and acupuncture, are often useful as part of a multimodal treatment approach to support patients with cancer pain and related symptoms. Radiotherapy is effective for pain from bone metastases. Neural blockade can be used for isolated pain-causing lesions.

All tissues of the joint may show pathology, including cartilage, subchondral bone, the menisci and the synovium. The joint should be considered a functional organ, with gait, periarticular muscles and related mechanical forces all playing a role in pathology. Modern imaging has highlighted the extensive nature of the pathology, even in joints with limited radiographic evidence of damage.

A full and detailed history of personal and family bleeding symptoms often indicates the nature and severity of a potential bleeding diathesis. All current and recent drugs should be reviewed as possible causes of a bleeding state. Specific inquiry should be made about oral anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists, or inhibitors of thrombin or factor (F)Xa or other antithrombotic therapy (exempli gratia acetylsalicylic acid [ASA, aspirin]). Defects of primary hemostasis (id est platelet disorders and von Willebrand disease) present with mucosal bleeding (exempli gratia epistaxis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and menorrhagia). Defects of secondary hemostasis (id est coagulation disorders such as hemophilia) usually present with hemarthroses and muscle hematoma.

Ablation for typical atrial flutter is highly successful and low risk, and should be considered first-line treatment. The risk of systemic embolization in atrial flutter should be considered similar to that for atrial fibrillation (AF). Atypical atrial flutter usually includes right atrial flutter circling around regions of scarring, or left atrial flutter following ablation of AF.

Non-epithelial malignant neoplasms account for 10-15% of ovarian cancers. They occur at younger ages than the more common epithelial ovarian cancer. Adequate surgical staging is essential, and should be performed even when fertility-sparing surgery is planned. Complete cytoreduction is the cornerstone of treatment in advanced and relapsed disease. There is inconclusive evidence for the use of systemic chemotherapy, rather than antihormonal treatment, in malignant non-epithelial ovarian tumors. In completely resected disease, there is little evidence to support a survival benefit with additional systemic treatment.

The synovial joint should be seen as a single dynamic structure with inter-relating components. Articular hyaline cartilage lines the end of each bone within a joint; it allows an efficient gliding motion when the joint moves, and absorbs and dissipates mechanical load. Subchondral bone is intimately associated with the overlying cartilage, which together probably act as a single structure for load transmission. Healthy synovial joints contain a small amount of synovial fluid, a lubricating liquid that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the cartilage. The complex joint structure provides frictionless articulation and load-bearing abilities.

It may be impossible to distinguish Parkinson's disease from other parkinsonian syndromes by clinial features alone. Progressive supranuclear palsy presents with gait disturbance and falls in later life; asymmetric signs (exempli gratia rest-tremor) favor a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Patients with parkinsonian dementia with Lewy bodies have early-onset dementia, and may have hallucinations or psychosis in the absence of dopaminergic therapy. Parkinsonism that presents before the age of 20 is more likely to be the result of a widespread degenerative or genetic disorder. Drug-induced parkinsonism is the most common cause of secondary parkinsonism.

If the pandemic of death from lung disease and cardiovascular disease is to be controlled, millions of smokers must quit. Price increases and mass media campaigns play a crucial role in motivating attempts to stop smoking. Effective treatments are available to support quit attempts; a major challenge lies in finding ways to get these treatments to the majority of smokers. In many countries, affordable and scalable systems need to be developed to ensure that smokers are offered evidence-based support for stopping as a matter of routine. In countries that have comprehensive smoking cessation programs, such as the UK and the USA, the main challenge is to ensure that smokers make full use of such services. More effective treatments, and treatments to help smokers who are not currently being helped, are focuses for current and future research.

Effective treatments are available to support quit attempts; a major challenge lies in finding ways to get these treatments to the majority of smokers. In many countries, affordable and scalable systems need to be developed to ensure that smokers are offered evidence-based support for stopping as a matter of routine. In countries that have comprehensive smoking cessation programs, such as the UK and the USA, the main challenge is to ensure that smokers make full use of such services. More effective treatments, and treatments to help smokers who are not currently being helped, are focuses for current and future research.
T-cell lymphomas are rare, representing approximately 10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. PTCL subtypes display marked variation in geographic distribution; AITL and EATL are more frequent in Europe whereas ATLL is more common in Japan and the Caribbean basin and ENKTCL in South East Asia. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 is strongly implicated in lymphomagenesis in ATLL, and Epstein-Barr virus in ENKTCL.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a global disease, present in all populations studied. RA should not be viewed as a benign chronic disease of the elderly. The peak age of onset occurs during working life, severely reducing participation and productivity. Furthermore, mortality is increased and there is very significant comorbidity. The disease inflicts huge economic costs on both the individual and society. It is essential that total healthcare and societal costs are considered when the economic impact of new drugs is considered. It remains to be determined whether the new targeted biological therapies will reduce the mortality associated with RA.

Assertive community treatment is the most effective model of community care. Urgent specialist referral and multidisciplinary assessment are needed for first-episode psychosis. Cognitive therapy should be offered in addition to drug treatments. Maintaining and improving physical health is vital. Clozapine should be considered early in treatment resistance. m-health approaches are becoming increasingly important.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) represents a significant healthcare problem, accounting for more than 350 000 deaths in the USA alone every year, and an estimated 6 million deaths annually worldwide. SCD is defined according to whether it was witnessed or not. If witnessed, unexpected death must have occurred within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms; if not, unexpected death must have occurred within 24 hours of the patient last being observed without symptoms. SCD usually occurs in individuals with underlying cardiac disease and occurs more frequently with male sex and increasing age. In SCD in those aged under 35 years, approximately 80% have a structural abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, very rarely coronary artery anomalies. Other causes include: metabolic (such as electrolyte abnormalities); drugs and medication; genetic syndromes such as primary electrical disorders or channelopathies. The overall survival rates of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have increased dramatically for reasons including: increasing recognition of the condition; more widespread adoption of high-performance cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by emergency medical personnel; increased rates of CPR training for local residents; emergency services personnel giving CPR instructions to bystanders by phone; and increasing public access to automated external defibrillators as a result of their being carried in police and fire service vehicles.

The 2015 World Health Organization Classification of Lung Tumors recommends the use of immunohistochemistry for the classification of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Classification of NSCLC further into specific pathological subtypes (exempli gratia adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma) will determine eligibility for certain types of molecular testing and aid therapeutic decisions based on the specific histological and genetic characteristics of the tumor. An epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation is a validated predictive marker for response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments.
Identifiable radiographic abnormalities such as disc degeneration, disc protrusions and osteophytes are common in individuals over 40 years of age and almost universal in those over 50, but without corresponding clinical findings. In geriatric patients, radiographic evidence of spinal degeneration is commonplace but may not be a source of back pain. In addition, geriatric radiographic abnormalities tend to persist after a patient goes into remission. In individuals over the age of 50, radiographic evaluation has a greater likelihood of identifying a tumor, osteoporotic fracture, infection or severe spinal stenosis. MRI is the most sensitive radiographic technique to identify anatomic alterations of the spinal elements. Discography is a relatively unreliable method of determining the locus of disc symptomatology, with numerous false positives. When CT/MRI and the examination do not define the pathology, electromyography (EMG) may be helpful, but at best this has less than 80% accuracy in detecting a nerve root lesion. Laboratory tests usually are not needed for acute low back pain unless 'red flags' are present, or for patient monitoring to avoid potential hematologic, hepatic or renal drug-related complications.

The standard treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) involves repeated cycles of myelotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in prolonged cytopenia that requires intensive supportive care. Treatment of AML is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly related to infection; this risk is compounded by the emergence of bacteria with multidrug resistance. Standard practice is for patients to be hospitalized for induction chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery is achieved (3-4 weeks). Following chemotherapy, prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and reduce mortality rates is a standard recommendation; the choice of antibiotic should be informed by the local antibiogram. Prophylaxis with antifungals with both anti-mold and anticandida activity is beneficial. Attention to good hygiene, particularly dental and perianal care, is important.

'Effective, unambiguous communication is essential for efficient translation of promising scientific discoveries into approved medical products' (US Food and Drug Administration, BEST framework). Today, many key terms and definitions have been used inconsistently, and this ambiguity makes it difficult to evaluate products and evidence. For many measurements, it can be helpful to think about whether the data were collected actively through human intervention (exempli gratia a clinician observing the patient, or a patient filling in a diary) or passively through a sensor. Most high-quality data sources will likely be 'multimodal', meaning that the data will come from multiple sensors. Developing a common set of language around biomarkers, measurements, outcomes and other terms will streamline premarket discussions between regulators and industry, and also postmarket with patients and providers. The authors defined a first draft set of definitions, which we expect and hope will evolve as technologies and applications develop over time. If someone uses a term you don't know in a conversation, best practice is to ask the person to clarify what they mean. Many terms are still in early development and have loose definitions.

Conventional belief in the need for intensive follow-up after treatment for primary breast cancer is being challenged, but it may have non-measurable benefits to the patient and their doctors and nurses. Attention must be paid to both physical and psychological rehabilitation. Simple physical exercises, initiated early, accelerate and improve rehabilitation. Short- and long-term emotional and spiritual support should not be overlooked.

It is estimated that 80-100% of patients receiving chemotherapy without antiemetic prophylaxis will experience some level of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting are triggered when afferent impulses from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), pharynx and vagal afferent fibers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract travel to the vomiting center (VC) in the central nervous system. The main approach to the control of emesis has been to identify the active neurotransmitters (serotonin and substance P) and their receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine-3 [5-HT ] and neurokinin-1 [NK-1]) in the CNS and the GI tract that mediate the afferent inputs to the VC. Several 5-HT and NK-1 receptor antagonists have been developed for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis.
Immune checkpoints are cell surface receptors that are expressed on activated T cells and other immune cells, which normally serve a co-inhibitory role in keeping the adaptive immune system in check to prevent autoimmune diseases. Immune checkpoints may be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies, resulting in T-cell activation and an immune response against cancer. This is analogous to releasing the brakes to accelerate a fast car. Immune checkpoint inhibitors against CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 have produced durable tumor shrinkage and prolonged survival in patients with a variety of solid tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with melanoma, lung cancers, head and neck cancers, bladder cancers, kidney cancers, colorectal cancers, MSI-high solid tumors, Merkel cell cancers and Hodgkin's lymphoma. These include ipilimumab (CTLA-4 mAb), nivolumab, pembrolizumab (PD-1 mAbs), atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab (PD-L1 mAbs). Clinical trials are ongoing for additional indications, as well as various combination therapies. Immune-related adverse events are due to autoimmune inflammation resulting from overactivation of T cells; they include colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, thyroiditis and pneumonitis.

The evidence required for approval of biosimilars is greater than that for generic versions of small molecule drugs. The 'biosimilar pathway' developed by the European Medicines Agency follows the principles that apply following a change to manufacturing of a biologic. Central to the pathway is the demonstration that there are no significant clinical differences between a biosimilar and its reference biologic, based on analytical, preclinical and clinical data. Based on this, and demonstration that the mechanism of action is the same in different conditions, the biosimilar will be approved for the same indications as the reference biologic - known as extrapolation. 'Intended copy' biologics manufactured in countries with less stringent regulation than the EU and USA may not be true biosimilars and clinical equivalence cannot be assumed. Safety monitoring in the EU over the 10 years since the introduction of biosimilars has not identified any relevant difference in the nature, severity or frequency of adverse effects between biosimilars and their reference medicines. While the safety data for a biosimilar may be limited at launch, comparability studies mean that the range and severity of potential adverse events can be predicted from the experience with the originator reference biologic gained over many years of clinical use. Biosimilars are subject to the same pharmacovigilance as their reference biologic, including special report requirements (black triangle; risk minimization plan).

Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological disorder. The incidence of epilepsy is highest in the elderly. Epilepsy can be controlled by antiepileptic drugs in the majority of patients. In general, a person with epilepsy is two to three times more likely to have an untimely death than someone in the general population.
Digital medicine is an emerging medical and scientific discipline concerned with the application of software and hardware to health through cycles of innovation and development of research-based evidence. Digital medicine products can be used for measurement and/or treatment, and in combination with existing diagnostics and therapeutics. Measurement using digital products may enable more continuous, more precise and less biased information than traditional means of measurement in medicine. These measurement advantages are applicable in clinical care and in the conduct of clinical research, where such measurements can be used as clinical endpoints or for other measurement and monitoring purposes such as establishing eligibility for a trial or detecting adverse effects of a treatment under study.

Sanger sequencing, although groundbreaking, is labor intensive, time consuming and expensive, and hence it has been replaced with NGS. The two major methods for NGS use the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms. Illumina uses fluorescently tagged nucleotides while Ion Torrent detects a pH (voltage) change on nucleotide binding. It is vital that the results of NGS are considered in a clinical context. A result from an inadequate sample should not be interpreted as a negative result. Methods of single-molecule sequencing, although relatively error prone, have utility in the sequencing of large variants and transcript isoforms.

Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for the development of B-cell lymphoma. Viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (associated with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and human herpes virus 8 (associated with primary effusion lymphoma) are often implicated. Treatment should target the lymphoma and the cause of the immunosuppression (id est highly active antiretroviral therapy in lymphomas associated with HIV and a reduction in therapeutic immunosuppression in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Improved HIV treatment is leading to a falling incidence of HIV-associated lymphoma. The use of rituximab in HIV-associated B-cell lymphomas is generally considered standard in those with well-controlled infection.

Insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes attempts to keep plasma glucose levels as near normal as possible without causing hypoglycemia. Most young patients are treated with a basal-bolus regimen incorporating rapid-acting insulin analogs at mealtimes and a basal long-acting insulin analog. Twice-daily fixed-mixture regimens may be useful for children and the elderly. Pump therapy is a very effective and safe mode of treatment for some patients. Pancreatic and islet cell transplantation may be offered to highly selected type 1 patients. Insulin therapy confers the need to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. Diabetes control is assessed by regular measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ). Diabetes education programs help diabetic patients to manage their condition more effectively.

Twice-daily fixed-mixture regimens may be useful for children and the elderly. Pump therapy is a very effective and safe mode of treatment for some patients. Pancreatic and islet cell transplantation may be offered to highly selected type 1 patients. Insulin therapy confers the need to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. Diabetes control is assessed by regular measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ). Diabetes education programs help diabetic patients to manage their condition more effectively.

Individuals with recurrent nosebleeds and a family history of epistaxis should be carefully evaluated for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Henoch-Schönlein purpura in childhood may lead to complications in pregnancy and renal failure in adulthood. Palpable purpura, renal disease, polyarthropathy and cryoglobulinemia are usually associated with hepatitis C infection.

Hepatitis B and C virus are the most common causes of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination and is treatable in 40-60% of cases. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it is treatable in up to 85% of cases with interferon-based regimens or the new oral therapy sofosbuvir. Liver transplantation may be required for end-stage chronic liver disease and small hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C almost invariably recurred after liver transplantation and was problematic, but the availability of additional therapeutic options is likely to change this.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease initially localized to the joint lining. Dominant features are synovial inflammation, and proliferation and outgrowth of the synovial lining layer, with destruction of articular cartilage and bone. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in RA pathology. The primary pathogenic event may reside within the immune system or in the synovial lining. However, data from genome-wide association studies and preclinical autoantibody development suggest primary immune dysregulation. Accelerated cardiovascular disease in RA may be secondary to inflammation or intrinsic to the disease process. The inter-relationship between the immune system and bone is receiving increasing attention (osteoimmunology).

Tumors of the pineal region often present with obstructive hydrocephalus. The wide range of tumor types that can arise in the pineal region makes histological diagnosis mandatory. The only exception is a patient with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that indicate the presence of a malignant germ cell tumor. CSF studies and spinal MRI should be obtained in all patients with a germ cell tumor or pineoblastoma.

Persistent oozing from venepuncture sites in a septic patient, or massive vaginal bleeding in an obstetric patient, suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A DIC score >= 5 is indicative of overt DIC. Hypofibrinogenemia usually indicates acute DIC, but the fibrinogen level is often normal or elevated in chronic DIC and it is not a reliable marker of the condition. Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause of DIC; bleeding is controlled with cryoprecipitate and platelet infusions.

Careful history taken together with clinical examination of joints establishes most diagnoses. Imaging and laboratory investigations may occasionally aid the assessment process. Differential diagnosis from other rheumatologic conditions and inflammatory arthritides is part of the diagnostic process.

In patients presenting with a clinical picture consistent with an acute episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), plasma exchange should be started empirically before the diagnosis is confirmed by ADAMTS13 activity testing. Glucocorticoid therapy to suppress the production of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies is an important adjunct to plasma exchange therapy. Rituximab has an increasing role in the treatment of refractory and chronic relapsing TTP and may prevent future episodes by correcting the deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity. The development of caplacizumab as an adjunct to plasma exchange therapy has been shown to decrease the number of plasma exchange procedures required to achieve a normal platelet count and significantly decrease the risk for exacerbations of TTP. Many patients with congenital TTP require chronic plasma infusions as well as careful observations for chronic neurological and vascular complications.

A large number of drugs are currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); several target novel mediators and pathways, incorporating concepts such as epigenetic modification. Signaling pathway inhibitors are orally active drugs with potencies similar to biological therapies. Their successful passage through phase III trials could have a major impact on RA management. Mesenchymal stem cells have both immunomodulatory and tissue engineering potential. They could develop into an important cellular therapy for diseases such as RA. In the future, rheumatologists may identify and treat patients in the presymptomatic phase of RA, using approaches such as therapeutic tolerance induction.

Uncomplicated cystitis in women, diagnosed by history and pyuria, can be treated empirically with short courses of antibiotics. Recurrent cystitis in women may require longer courses of, or prophylactic, antibiotics. Cystitis in men generally requires a formal urologic assessment. Pyelonephritis usually requires intravenous antibiotics as initial treatment.

Historically, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) adopted a 'one way fits all' approach, using induction chemotherapy to kill large numbers of leukemic cells. In individualized consolidation therapy, the same effect is achieved with either repeated intensive non-myeloablative chemotherapy or, for eligible patients, allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Treatment is strongly influenced by a patient's cytogenetic/molecular risk profile, and is informed by other factors, such as age, fitness and the response to induction chemotherapy; it is therefore highly individualized. Whilst the outlook for younger adults (< 60 years) has gradually improved over recent years, the outlook for older patients remains dismal. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) therapy has high cure rates but early death rates remain an issue for patients presenting with a high white blood cell count. Midostaurin inhibits several tyrosine kinases, including FLT3, which is constitutively activated in about 30% of patients with AML, usually because of an internal tandem duplication ( FLT3 -ITD). It is indicated for use in combination with standard induction chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with FLT3 -ITD. Enasidenib inhibits aberrant isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) which catalyzes formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. IDH2 mutations occur in approximately 12% of AML patients, particularly in older adults with normal karyotype. Enasidenib is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with the IDH2 mutation. The anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been approved for first-line treatment of AML, following modifications to the dosage and schedule in order to address the safety concerns that arose following its initial approval. It is also approved for relapsed AML (including in pediatric patients); both indications are with a reduced fractionated dose schedule. Clinical trials focusing on small, genetically similar subsets are becoming the norm; success with molecular targeted therapies approved in 2017 is likely to herald a shift towards a more targeted, individualized approach. All patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Enasidenib inhibits aberrant isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) which catalyzes formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. IDH2 mutations occur in approximately 12% of AML patients, particularly in older adults with normal karyotype. Enasidenib is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with the IDH2 mutation. The anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been approved for first-line treatment of AML, following modifications to the dosage and schedule in order to address the safety concerns that arose following its initial approval. It is also approved for relapsed AML (including in pediatric patients); both indications are with a reduced fractionated dose schedule. Clinical trials focusing on small, genetically similar subsets are becoming the norm; success with molecular targeted therapies approved in 2017 is likely to herald a shift towards a more targeted, individualized approach. All patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.
Historically, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) adopted a 'one way fits all' approach, using induction chemotherapy to kill large numbers of leukemic cells. In individualized consolidation therapy, the same effect is achieved with either repeated intensive non-myeloablative chemotherapy or, for eligible patients, allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Treatment is strongly influenced by a patient's cytogenetic/molecular risk profile, and is informed by other factors, such as age, fitness and the response to induction chemotherapy; it is therefore highly individualized. Whilst the outlook for younger adults (< 60 years) has gradually improved over recent years, the outlook for older patients remains dismal. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) therapy has high cure rates but early death rates remain an issue for patients presenting with a high white blood cell count.

Ensure that all your diabetic patients are enrolled for regular retinal screening examinations - these can save their sight. Hypertensive patients do not require eye screening, but if they develop a vein occlusion as a complication of hypertension, urgent referral is indicated. If patients present with an eye problem that has no apparent cause, it is worth reviewing the patient's systemic medications, as a number of systemic agents may have ocular side effects.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis. No investigations are mandatory or independently diagnostic. Investigations are usually performed to exclude plausible alternative diagnoses and, in the case of electromyography (EMG), to improve diagnostic certainty in body regions without clinical signs. Most symptomatic individuals will have blood tests, brain and spinal MRI and neurophysiological testing during their diagnostic work up but there is risk of incidental findings that can lead to diagnostic delay. Evidence of active denervation and chronic reinnervation in multiple myotomes on EMG is supportive, but not specific, for ALS. EMG can detect subclinical lower motor neuron disease and expedite diagnosis. The El Escorial diagnostic criteria and subsequent modifications are intended for research purposes and do not predict the clinical course of the disease. The terms possible, probable and definite ALS should be avoided when counseling individuals.

Benign liver lesions are relatively common. Most lesions identified are unrelated to the symptoms under investigation. Hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasia are managed conservatively. Adenomas are closely linked to hormone therapy and require surveillance and occasionally surgical resection.

Type 2 diabetes management requires patient education on the fundamentals of self-care, including monitoring of glucose levels, dietary management - with an emphasis on weight reduction in the overweight or obese - increased physical activity and reduced sedentariness. Medications are often required for glucose control. There are multiple classes of glucose-lowering medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors and insulin. Glycemic treatment targets aim for an HbA 1c that ranges from 6.0% to 7.0%, depending on the age of the patients and their risk for hypoglycemia. All patients with type 2 diabetes who smoke must receive smoking cessation intervention(s). Cardiovascular risk factors must be treated to targets, including lipids and blood pressure. Consideration should be given to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) therapy where appropriate. Bariatric surgery should be considered in the obese with type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control. Open dialogue between healthcare professionals and patients is important in order to identify factors that may be undermining self-care, and to rectify poor glucose control early.

Around 10-20% of patients with stones in the gallbladder have common bile duct (CBD) stones at the time of cholecystectomy (the prevalence rises with age). Transabdominal ultrasound is 25-80% accurate for detection of CBD stones, depending on the experience of the examiner. Endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are accurate tests for detection of CBD stones and should generally precede endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), unless the clinical signs and symptoms and transabdominal ultrasound findings make therapeutic ERCP inevitable. Clearance of all stones from the CBD via ERCP is possible in more than 95% of patients. Biliary decompression, preferably by endoscopic or radiologic means, is critical in severe suppurative cholangitis with choledocholithiasis.

Performing an electrocardiogram (12-lead if possible) during symptoms is essential. The frequency of a patient's symptoms will determine the best non-invasive test to apply. Non-invasive monitoring can be performed repeatedly if needed. Digital and smartphone technologies will expand in use in future. Treadmill exercise testing can be useful to induce cardiac arrhythmias in selected patients. Electrophysiological (EP) testing was initially conceived to provoke and identify cardiac arrhythmias. However, it is now performed infrequently solely as a diagnostic test; instead it is more often performed during an ablation procedure.

Macrocomedones frequently require surgical treatment with cautery, as pharmacological therapeutic options are unhelpful. Acne nodules/cysts respond well to intralesional triamcinolone injection or cryotherapy. Acne scarring is common, and the best approach is prevention by early effective therapy. Laser therapy may be helpful for acne scarring.

Multiple histological variants of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) exist, although there is no prognostic significance between the subtypes. However, some of the subtypes histologically overlap with other forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and clinical correlation is needed to distinguish these. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) is composed of sheets of CD30+ activated T cells that comprise more than 75% of the neoplastic cells. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1, epithelial membrane antigen and full staging work-up are used to distinguish between a primary cutaneous tumor and cutaneous involvement from nodal ALCL. Primary cutaneous small/medium CD4+ T cell lymphoproliferative disorder is an indolent process comprised of diffuse to nodular collections of CD4+ cells that generally present as single papules on the head and neck. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a subcutaneous indolent disorder composed of CD3+, CD8+, betaF-1+ T cells with notable rimming of adipocytes, in contrast to gamma/δ lymphoma which is clinically aggressive and comprised of dermal and subcutaneous CD4-/CD8- or rarely CD4+, CD8+ T cells with a gamma/δ (TCR-gamma+) phenotype. The clinically aggressive cytotoxic CTCLs are: primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma, primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma (Berti's lymphoma) and extranodal NK-T cell lymphoma, nasal type. These diseases have a CD8+ or CD56+ immunophenotype and display T-cell intracellular antigen-1+, granzyme-B+ and perforin+ cytotoxic markers. Full systemic work-up is necessary. Other rare secondary cutaneous T-cell processes occur from systemic T-cell lymphomas, and correlation with nodal histopathology is helpful in diagnosis.

Phototherapy (broad-band UVB and narrow-band UVB) is widely used for extensive chronic plaque psoriasis and sebo-psoriasis, and persistent guttate psoriasis. Burning and, rarely, photosensitive rashes complicate phototherapy in the short term. There is a small increase in the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer with long-term phototherapy. Photochemotherapy (PUVA) is indicated for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis involving more than 10% of the body surface area, and those whose psoriasis does not respond to topical therapy. Short-term risks of PUVA include nausea (following oral ingestion of methoxsalen), itching and phototoxic reactions. Long-term risks of PUVA include premature skin aging and skin cancer (non-melanoma and melanoma). In patients who already have risk factors for skin cancer, phototherapy and PUVA should be prescribed only with extreme caution.

Weight loss requires a negative energy balance, which for most people is achieved more readily by caloric restriction than by increased physical activity. Dietary adherence is more important than the specific dietary pattern; choice of diet should therefore consider the particular patient's characteristics in terms of culture, lifestyle, understanding, sex, age etc. Important factors in promoting dietary adherence include convenience, choice and an ongoing behavioral support program. Healthy diets focus on fruit and vegetables, whole grains and lean unprocessed meat, chicken and seafood. Up to 30% of energy may come from fat but intake of saturated (animal) fat should be very limited. The predominant fats consumed should be of plant origin such as monounsaturated fatty acids (exempli gratia from olive oil) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and omega-3 fatty acids from seafood. Sugared beverages should be avoided; water is the ideal drink for hydration. Changing to a healthy diet has benefits for cardiometabolic health irrespective of weight loss. A reduction in bodyweight through caloric restriction will result in lower daily energy expenditure, and maintenance of weight loss will then depend on physical activity.
Weight loss requires a negative energy balance, which for most people is achieved more readily by caloric restriction than by increased physical activity. Dietary adherence is more important than the specific dietary pattern; choice of diet should therefore consider the particular patient's characteristics in terms of culture, lifestyle, understanding, sex, age etc. Important factors in promoting dietary adherence include convenience, choice and an ongoing behavioral support program. Healthy diets focus on fruit and vegetables, whole grains and lean unprocessed meat, chicken and seafood.

When the etiology of low back pain is apparent, it is most often a musculoskeletal abnormality of the lumbar spine; however, low back pain may also be referred from visceral pathology. Chronic low back pain is a complex biopsychosocial process that cannot be explained on purely anatomic, biomechanical, neurophysiological, immunologic, inflammatory or neurochemical grounds. Symptomatic therapy can be initiated without imaging tests in adults under 50 who lack 'red flags' - history of major trauma, cancer, or signs or symptoms of systemic disease, tumor, immunocompromise, fracture, abscess, progressive and severe neurological loss, or cauda equina syndrome. For patients over 50 and those whose findings suggest systemic disease, plain radiography and simple laboratory tests can almost completely rule out underlying systemic disease. CT or MRI should be reserved for patients over 50 and those with 'red flags' (see above). Exercise has moderate utility in the prevention or treatment of chronic back pain. Pregabalin has small to modest analgesic efficacy. Massage, spinal manipulation and acupuncture provide small-to-moderate short-term benefits. There is insufficient evidence to support the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of chronic low back pain, particularly in light of the increased risks for gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events. Epidural steroid injections produce small-to-moderate short-term pain relief. Antidepressants reduce pain severity but do not improve function. Integrated treatments that address the salient biopsychosocial factors perpetuating disability appear to have the best chance of returning disabled persons to a functional quality of life.

Blood in the urine can originate from anywhere along the urinary tract and may indicate underlying pathology. Dipstick testing is sensitive but does not distinguish between physiological and pathological amounts of blood. The most common causes of hematuria are stones, infection, nephritis and prostate enlargement. Malignancy becomes more likely in patients over 50 years of age and who smoke. Some drugs can cause hematuria. The morphology of red blood cells may distinguish between glomerular and lower urinary tract causes. Investigation of hematuria can be in a 'one-stop' clinic with facilities for cytology, ultrasonography and flexible cystoscopy so that diagnosis can be made in one visit. Ultrasonography is useful for identifying renal parenchymal disease and urinary tract obstruction. Radiography will identify stones. CT scanning is highly sensitive for detecting stones, renal masses and infections. Management depends on the underlying cause identified. Unexplained hematuria should be followed up with repeat tests at a later date.

Epidural and/or nerve root canal injections are safer and more reliable if done with fluoroscopic monitoring. Intrabursal and trigger-point injections with low-dose steroids can often provide prompt pain reduction. Surgery is usually effective for refractory sciatica but is of equivocal benefit for low back pain. Approximately one-third of successful spine fusions provide pain relief for chronic low back pain.

First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are effective treatments for the acute phase and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. The long-acting injectable (depot) forms of FGAs and SGAs are useful for patients who are non-adherent to their medications. Clozapine is the only SGA that is effective for positive symptoms resistant to other antipsychotics. SGAs other than clozapine have become the first-line treatments for acute psychotic episodes and maintenance therapy. FGAs and SGAs are relatively effective for treating secondary negative symptoms but are not effective in treating primary negative symptoms and have limited effects on the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. Add-on treatments for people with residual positive symptoms have not been clearly demonstrated to be effective.

Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. Lymphocytes are formed in an antigen-independent stage in the bone marrow (and thymus for T cells) but need an encounter with antigen in secondary lymphoid tissue to develop further. The different types of lymphoma probably arise from different stages of the lymphocyte life cycle. Lymphomas arise because of several complex genetic changes involving activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.

Biologics are typically proteins, ranging in size from simple proteins to large complex monoclonal antibodies. They are produced using living cell lines. All biologics have inherent variability, which creates batch-to-batch variability for all products. Furthermore, biologics themselves show inherent variation between batches (microheterogeneity), such that no batch is identical to previous batches. Biosimilars are highly similar, but not identical, to their reference (originator) biologic. The slight differences between batches of biologics, or between biologics and biosimilars, are evaluated and not expected to have any meaningful effect in clinical use. Changes to manufacturing processes can introduce significant changes to the structure of a biologic; analytics tests (and, exceptionally, new clinical trials) are required to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed for these therapies.

As chronic pain is a multidimensional interdisciplinary biopsychosocial condition, expert consensus and some research recommends a selective, interdisciplinary, mechanism-based approach as the method of choice to restore quality of life and functionality. The specific disciplines of healthcare providers required to offer a multidisciplinary approach depend on the variety and complexity of patients seen and the available resources, as outlined in the stepped care model. Most pain care will occur in primary care settings, but ideally with close support from interdisciplinary teams of relevant health practitioners (exempli gratia psychology, physical therapy, complementary and integrative medicine) including pain medicine and other relevant specialists. The education of patients about their pain conditions, enabling their participation in shared decision-making and the development of self-management skills, is now considered a cornerstone of successful pain management, whether it is delivered at home, in primary care or specialty care settings. Research evidence to support the effectiveness of the selective, interdisciplinary stepped approach to chronic pain treatment is not yet conclusive; more research is needed to prove its cost-effectiveness in specific pain phenotypes. Pharmacotherapy of chronic and cancer pain is mostly multimodal, combining several different drugs that act on different targets. Pharmacotherapy is often combined with other treatment options. Opioids play a major role in cancer pain but data for their long-term effectiveness in chronic non-cancer pain are limited. There is substantial variation among patients in dose-response and side effects for individual drugs within a drug category. Thus, careful drug titration is required for each individual patient.

There is substantial variation among patients in dose-response and side effects for individual drugs within a drug category. Thus, careful drug titration is required for each individual patient.
As chronic pain is a multidimensional interdisciplinary biopsychosocial condition, expert consensus and some research recommends a selective, interdisciplinary, mechanism-based approach as the method of choice to restore quality of life and functionality. The specific disciplines of healthcare providers required to offer a multidisciplinary approach depend on the variety and complexity of patients seen and the available resources, as outlined in the stepped care model. Most pain care will occur in primary care settings, but ideally with close support from interdisciplinary teams of relevant health practitioners (exempli gratia psychology, physical therapy, complementary and integrative medicine) including pain medicine and other relevant specialists. The education of patients about their pain conditions, enabling their participation in shared decision-making and the development of self-management skills, is now considered a cornerstone of successful pain management, whether it is delivered at home, in primary care or specialty care settings. Research evidence to support the effectiveness of the selective, interdisciplinary stepped approach to chronic pain treatment is not yet conclusive; more research is needed to prove its cost-effectiveness in specific pain phenotypes.

Neuronal tumors are uncommon brain neoplasms typically diagnosed in children and young adults. The principal management of neuronal tumors is surgical; total or subtotal resection can be associated with long-term tumor control. The behavior of these tumors can be unpredictable and remains poorly understood because of their rarity.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) usually presents acutely in previously healthy adults with diverse features resulting from microvascular thrombosis: (1) microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; (2) thrombocytopenia; and (3) end-organ damage. The brain, heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the most commonly affected end organs. Neurological symptoms are the most common. Congenital TTP is a much more common cause of TTP in childhood/adolescence and in pregnancy than in non-pregnant adults. Acute presentations of congenital TTP cannot generally be distinguished from immune-mediated TTP on the basis of presenting features, though some individuals have chronic subacute symptoms. Pregnancy is a trigger for TTP, especially the congenital form. This should be considered as a potential cause for unexplained fetal growth restriction or stillbirth, unexplained thrombocytopenia in pregnancy and atypical/severe cases of pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count).

Stem cell therapy has demonstrated a modest improvement in cardiac performance in some studies, but the clinical effect of such therapies has not yet been proven. A fully implantable, automated, phrenic nerve stimulation system is an alternative approach to the treatment of patients with central sleep apnea. Early findings are promising, and the results of ongoing trials in patients with HF are awaited. In short-term studies, patiromer, a non-absorbable compound that predominantly binds to potassium in the colon and exchanges it for calcium, has demonstrated efficacy in managing hyperkalemia in patients treated with HF medications. A new formulation of subcutaneous furosemide delivered via a dedicated device has been developed.
Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histology of bladder cancer. Variant histology is common and is usually seen as a mixed pattern with conventional urothelial cancer. Low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors may recur but progression to muscle invasion occurs in < 5% of cases. High-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer will progress if not adequately treated with resection and intravesical therapy. Carcinoma in situ, whether primary or associated with Ta or T1 papillary tumor, is a high-risk cancer. Up to 30% of patients with high-grade non-muscle-invasive tumors and up to 70% with muscle-invasive disease may die of bladder cancer.

Overactive bladder (OAB) describes a condition in which the patient experiences urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Detrusor overactivity refers to involuntary detrusor contractions during filling; diagnosis is by urodynamic investigation. Bladder overactivity can be neurogenic or idiopathic. Idiopathic OAB can be associated with bladder outlet obstruction. A frequency/volume bladder record is useful in diagnosis. Initial management includes behavioral modification. Antimuscarinic drugs are a mainstay of conservative treatment. Other options for refractory OAB are neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Intradetrusor botulinum toxin injection is under investigation and seems promising for refractory cases.

Symptoms arise from involvement of cranial nerves, compression of brainstem or basal cerebral structures, and obstruction of the pharynx, middle ear or nasal cavity. Surgery can be curative if benign skull base tumors are resected completely. However, there is a relatively high risk of operative morbidity. Radiosurgery is an increasingly accepted alternative to surgery for small tumors in surgically high-risk areas. The goals of therapy for pituitary tumors include: reversal of endocrinopathy; elimination of mass effect with preservation or restoration of neurological function (particularly vision); and prevention of recurrence. Patients with prolactinomas should be managed medically; most other pituitary adenomas require surgery, with or without radiotherapy. Endocrine consultation is critical in the initial assessment and ongoing management of all patients with pituitary region tumors (adenomas, craniopharyngiomas and germ cell tumors). Particle-beam radiation can achieve long-term control of growth for radioresistant skull base tumors such as chordomas and chondrosarcomas.

Attempt to classify acute liver disease as hepatitis (most common), cholestatic (intermediate) or vascular (unusual). Simple blood tests and an ultrasound examination provide most of the information required. Hypoglycemia, coagulopathy and any evidence of confusion indicate a high risk of acute liver failure and the need for specialist care. Coagulopathy in cholestatic disorders responds to parenteral vitamin K.

Repeated hemarthroses lead to joint destruction and it is therefore important to treat every bleed early and effectively. Children with severe hemophilia should be treated with regular prophylactic injections of factor (F)VIII or FIX concentrate to prevent bleeding and preserve joint function. All licensed concentrates of FVIII and FIX, purified from pooled blood donor plasma, are virally attenuated, do not transmit HIV or hepatitis C virus and are safe and effective therapies. Recombinant clotting factor concentrates are being used increasingly as they are virally safe and equally effective. Patients should be tested regularly for the presence of inhibitors, and any patient who does not respond clinically to treatment with factor concentrate should be immediately tested for an inhibitory antibody. In mild hemophilia A, desmopressin can often be effective and avoids the use of concentrate. All potential carriers of hemophilia A and B should be offered genetic counseling and, if appropriate, DNA testing to ascertain their carrier status.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen), topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin are well-tolerated early pharmacological interventions in osteoarthritis (OA). Traditional NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are effective but have a range of important side effects that must be taken into consideration, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks. Care should be taken with the use of opioids for chronic OA pain. Optimal timing of analgesia should be considered in relation to when the patient has most symptoms and the likely duration of effect of the pharmacological intervention.

Biologics used in oncology settings have, as their trial endpoints, survival rates at 5 years. Confirmatory clinical trials for biosimilars tend to use disease response as an endpoint. This can be potentially problematic when the association between response and survival is weak, as with, for example, bevacizumab in bowel and gynecologic cancers. Formulary decisions for long-duration drug tenders need to be forward thinking; if shorter-schedule treatments are adopted, might this impact on the relative merits of the biosimilar formulations approved? Lack of a uniform approach to the design of clinical confirmatory trials, including differences in statistical design, disease and disease stage and participant characteristics, make it very difficult for clinicians to compare biosimilars. Extension of patent protection, as occurs when a new indication is gained, can impede biosimilar developers from gaining an 'interchangeable' designation.

Extension of patent protection, as occurs when a new indication is gained, can impede biosimilar developers from gaining an 'interchangeable' designation.
Biologics used in oncology settings have, as their trial endpoints, survival rates at 5 years. Confirmatory clinical trials for biosimilars tend to use disease response as an endpoint. This can be potentially problematic when the association between response and survival is weak, as with, for example, bevacizumab in bowel and gynecologic cancers.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg that is associated with new organ dysfunction/failure. When non-invasive measures fail in ACS, neuromuscular blockade with artificial respiration, percutaneous drainage or, finally, decompressive surgery may be indicated. Disconnected tail syndrome may be associated with bulky retroperitoneal collections, pancreatic ascites, pancreatic pleural effusion and/or pancreaticocutaneous fistula. If indicated, the treatment of choice for disconnected tail syndrome is long-term double-pigtail plastic stent drainage with or without transpapillary main pancreatic duct stenting. A pancreatic pseudoaneurysm should be treated with selective angiographic embolization. Although bleeding varices are uncommon, peripancreatic vein thrombosis should be diagnosed during the index hospital admission and patients should receive prompt anticoagulation therapy.

Liver disorders Acute and chronic liver disease can give rise to a variety of different hemostatic disorders; it is therefore important to assess each patient fully. Vitamin K therapy should be given if there is any possibility of deficiency. Although many patients have abnormal clotting tests, it is usually only necessary to treat those patients who are actively bleeding or require surgical intervention. Kidney disorders The risk of bleeding increases with the degree of renal failure. Dialysis reduces the hemorrhagic risk. Correction of anemia in the short term by red cell transfusion or in the long term with regular erythropoietin injections reduces the risk of bleeding.

Age is the greatest risk factor. Mutations in the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 denote high risk but account for only a small proportion of cancers. Mutations in several other genes, including CHEK2, TP53 and EMSY, are also involved. Hormonal factors, such as menstrual and obstetric history and exogenous hormones affect the risk of breast cancer. Diet, exercise, alcohol and smoking are modifiable risk factors. It is arguable whether the use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, early childbearing and long-term breast-feeding are modifiable in a modern society. Mammographic breast density is an independent and powerful risk factor that is not yet fully explained.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) involves abnormalities in sensation, motor and sympathetic function, as well as edema and abnormal sweating, with possible trophic changes. The involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in CRPS is likely, but detailed mechanisms differ among patients and remain unclear. Diagnosis requires the presence of a number of symptoms and signs in the areas of sensory, motor and sympathetic function in the absence of any other condition that might account for the symptoms. Intravenous regional sympathetic blockade with guanethidine or systemic phentolamine lack efficacy. Local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic chain is a default clinical treatment for acute CRPS, but the scarcity of data from randomized controlled trials precludes any firm conclusion regarding its effectiveness. Sympathectomy by surgical division, chemical neurolysis or radiofrequency lesioning should be avoided. Pharmacotherapy largely relies on studies of treatment of other types of neuropathic pain. CRPS warrants a cognitive behavioral and rehabilitation treatment program to improve coping and function. Severe CRPS may benefit from a trial of spinal cord stimulation or lidocaine (lignocaine) infusions and/or dorsal rate ganglion stimulation. New strategies in 'reprogramming the brain' may be able to address the neuroplastic changes that occur with CRPS.

Patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis are likely to carry cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) mutations in one or both alleles of the gene (compound heterozygotes). Children and young adults are often misdiagnosed with other gastrointestinal diseases. There is a lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer (35%), as well as a high risk of diabetes mellitus and exocrine insufficiency. Patients should undergo genetic counseling prior to genetic testing, and from the age of 40 years patients should be offered secondary screening for cancer in a regional pancreas cancer center. Alcohol and tobacco consumption should be strongly discouraged.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief but should almost never be used in isolation. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of pharmacological therapy, and their use in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reduces long-term irreversible joint damage. Treatment-to-target strategies, including combination DMARD therapy, rapidly suppress inflammation and minimize long-term damage and disability. DMARDs are generally safe with appropriate monitoring, but adverse events are potentially life-threatening if missed. Optimal therapy also includes access to allied health professionals such as nurse specialists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and podiatrists. The need for, and timing of, surgery requires skilled judgment. Consequently, the patient with RA is optimally managed from disease onset by a rheumatologist and their multidisciplinary team.

Gene therapy is a relatively new type of medicine that is closely monitored and regulated. Some gene therapies have a risk of cancer development (due to insertional mutagenesis), toxicities, unwanted immune reactions or off-target effects. In each case, a risk-benefit analysis provides guidance for patient selection and potential protocol modifications. Continued development of safer gene therapy vectors and protocols mitigates risks and makes gene therapy available to a broader patient population. Although opinions on the ethical implications are diverse, the prevailing view on gene editing is that applications should, at least currently, be restricted to somatic cells because there are still many unknowns about this novel technology. The costs of gene therapy are high, but these therapies could actually provide healthcare systems with savings over time; outcomes-based pricing is one proposed model.

Men with prostate cancer require emotional support as well as information on probable outcomes and the effects of the disease and its treatment. Sexual dysfunction is a common sequela of prostate cancer treatment. An open and informed discussion with the patient and his partner will do much to counter anxiety and loss of self-esteem. Erectile dysfunction can often be improved with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, prostaglandin suppositories or injections, or mechanical vacuum devices. Loss of libido can be reduced by using antiandrogens to treat prostate cancer in preference to bilateral orchidectomy or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog/antagonist. Osteoporosis and fractures are side effects of long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): vitamin D status should be evaluated before starting ADT, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as isometric exercises, encouraged during treatment. It is prudent to weigh the risks and benefits of ADT in men with cardiovascular risk factors and to monitor all risk factors during therapy. At-risk patients should be advised to make lifestyle changes as appropriate (exempli gratia stop smoking, lose weight, increase physical activity, improve diet).

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a variety of articular and extra-articular manifestations. The RA spectrum ranges from mild easily controlled disease to progressive destructive disease with organ- and life-threatening extra-articular complications. Extra-articular disease activity does not always parallel joint inflammation. Patients require close and regular monitoring by a specialist clinician to treat their joint disease and also to promptly diagnose and manage extra-articular manifestations.

Primary nocturnal enuresis is urinary incontinence that occurs at night in a child who has never been regularly dry at night. It is a relatively common condition, but generally resolves spontaneously and rarely persists into adolescence. The frequency/volume bladder record is the most useful investigative tool for primary nocturnal enuresis and also helps in monitoring treatment. Treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis is rarely required, but can include modification of fluid intake, behavioral treatments and occasional use of ADH (desmopressin). Nocturia - defined as waking from sleep to void - has a significant impact on quality of life and is a major cause of falls in the elderly. Treatment of nocturia is largely on the basis of the underlying cause. Loop diuretics in the afternoon may be useful if nocturia is related to congestive heart failure. ADH should be used with caution, as it can cause rapid hyponatremia. Antimuscarinics may prove useful only in patients with severe nocturnal detrusor overactivity.

Treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis is rarely required, but can include modification of fluid intake, behavioral treatments and occasional use of ADH (desmopressin). Nocturia - defined as waking from sleep to void - has a significant impact on quality of life and is a major cause of falls in the elderly. Treatment of nocturia is largely on the basis of the underlying cause. Loop diuretics in the afternoon may be useful if nocturia is related to congestive heart failure. ADH should be used with caution, as it can cause rapid hyponatremia. Antimuscarinics may prove useful only in patients with severe nocturnal detrusor overactivity.
Many intrinsic brain tumors can be defined by their driver mutations, some of which are diagnostically and prognostically relevant. For example, the presence of an IDH mutation generally confers a better prognosis than no IDH mutation with chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss (as seen in early forms of glioblastoma or histological classic glioblastoma). IDH -mutant tumors may be astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas. They occur in people aged 30-40 years and are usually located in the frontal lobe. IDH wild-type glioblastomas occur mostly in older people (50-70 years old). They generally have chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss, and in many cases, EGFR amplification and/or TERT promoter mutation. Gliomas in midline structures are highly likely to have a histone H3.3 K27M mutation. MGMT promoter methylation increases chemosensitivity to temozolomide treatment.

In childhood obesity the aim is usually to attenuate weight gain rather than induce weight loss. An elderly person at any given body mass index or waist circumference is always likely to have a higher percentage of fat. Pregnancy is a crucial stage both for the mother and the fetus in preventing and managing future obesity. Management of obesity is different for different age groups; individualization of care with informed patient choice is important. Weight loss is not always an appropriate outcome in an individual; overweight or obesity may provide a protective influence.

Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed on the basis of transrectal or transperineal biopsy. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The Gleason score of these biopsies, clinical stage on digital rectal exam (DRE) and presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value provide an estimate of the risk of extraprostatic extension. Multiparametric MRI is increasingly used to target biopsies and can provide information about local staging. Bone scanning identifies bone metastases, although the probability of these in patients with PSA below 10 ng/mL is low. PET/CT is useful to detect soft-tissue and bone metastases.

The pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is incompletely understood. Initial acinar cell injury has several cellular consequences that promote local inflammation. Severe local damage is associated with a systemic inflammatory response, which, when uncontrolled, may progress to organ failure. AP may induce bacterial translocation. Viable bacteria in the bloodstream may colonize necrotic pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissue resulting in infection.

The well-conducted clinical trial remains the benchmark of both therapy and medical progress. The patient must be an informed and willing participant in the study. Patient safety is of primary concern in a trial. The clinical trial process needs to be encouraged within routine clinical practice.

Mastectomy and lumpectomy/wide local excision plus radiation are therapeutically equivalent for most women. Given adequate information, women can choose equally between mastectomy and breast conservation approaches. Breast reconstruction is viable and can be offered as an immediate or a delayed procedure. In the future, selected patients may be able to avoid the 3-6 weeks of conventional postoperative radiotherapy by receiving a single dose of intraoperative radiotherapy during lumpectomy.

Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for COPD; about 80% of patients with COPD are, or have been, smokers. Almost all smokers develop impaired lung function. Other influences, including air pollution and occupational exposures, contribute to COPD risk. Individual genetic susceptibility probably accounts for the heterogeneity of COPD risk. It is likely that many specific genetic factors will contribute to COPD risk; alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency is the best characterized of these. Asthma may contribute to COPD risk in some individuals. Early life events, including compromised lung development and growth, are likely to contribute to the risk of developing COPD later. Many individuals with COPD are undiagnosed, as symptoms of dyspnea can be minimized by restricting activity, which leads patients to discount their functional compromise.

Psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis; there is no blood test specific for this disease. Chronic discoid plaque psoriasis is the most common subtype of psoriasis. The scalp, elbows, knees and sacrum are the areas most commonly affected by psoriasis. Psoriasis can sometimes be triggered by infection, trauma, stress or medications. Psoriasis is associated with a number of comorbidities that have important health and socioeconomic implications.

The next wave of biosimilars will be therapeutic oncology drugs, such as rituximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, and recombinant insulins. The equivalence of oncology biosimilars will be based on surrogate pharmacodynamic endpoints, rather than survival, and extrapolation from non-oncology indications, with regulators considering the totality of evidence. Marketing pressure to differentiate between medicines is usually based on clinical differences in phase III trials. However, biosimilars do not fit this commercial model, as by definition, they offer no difference in efficacy or safety with which to differentiate brands.

The risk of new or severe adverse events is likely to be lower with a biosimilar than with a novel biological agent. Adoption of the naming conventions and accurate reporting is key to effective surveillance and the identification of any rare adverse events that emerge post launch. 2D DataMatrix barcodes, with batch numbers and expiry dates, can be used to track biologics at all points in the supply chain. Slight changes in a product can result in immunogenicity profile changes, but this applies to all biological medicines and not just biosimilars.
Diagnosis of leukemia is based on an integration of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic and genetic findings. Many types of leukemia, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), show no specific symptoms in the early stages and may be diagnosed incidentally during a physical examination or routine blood test. Both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can present with signs and symptoms of bone marrow failure, including those related to anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The presence of blasts in a peripheral blood smear suggests an underlying hematologic disorder. Myeloblasts containing Auer rods are pathognomonic for AML. Examination of bone marrow aspirate can confirm the diagnosis of leukemia. Flow cytometry can differentiate between ALL and AML on the basis of different cell surface markers. On immunophenotypic analysis, the presence of B-cell antigens in the absence of T-cell antigens differentiates B-cell ALL from T-cell ALL. CML is diagnosed by the presence of the chromosome translocation t(9;22), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The t(9;22) mutation also occurs in some cases of ALL. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with favorable responses to treatment, while others are associated with treatment failure. Detection of recurring gene mutations in AML and ALL provides important genetic information about prognosis and informs the selection of targeted therapies.

Bronchodilators are the first-line treatment in COPD; they can be effectively used concurrently and also have beneficial non-bronchodilator effects. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids can improve airflow modestly and can reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations. Short courses (7-14 days) of systemic corticosteroids may help following exacerbations, but should not be used over the long term. Optimum clinical benefits require an integrated program combining pulmonary rehabilitation with pharmacotherapy. Influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with COPD; there is also some evidence to support pneumococcal vaccination. Surgical removal of large bullae and lung volume reduction surgery may improve lung function and symptoms in carefully selected patients. Lung transplantation in patients with very advanced COPD improves health status and functional capacity, though it does not convey a survival benefit. Rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in terms of improving exercise tolerance, symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue in patients with COPD.

Inhaled glucocorticosteroids can improve airflow modestly and can reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations. Short courses (7-14 days) of systemic corticosteroids may help following exacerbations, but should not be used over the long term. Optimum clinical benefits require an integrated program combining pulmonary rehabilitation with pharmacotherapy. Influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with COPD; there is also some evidence to support pneumococcal vaccination. Surgical removal of large bullae and lung volume reduction surgery may improve lung function and symptoms in carefully selected patients. Lung transplantation in patients with very advanced COPD improves health status and functional capacity, though it does not convey a survival benefit.

Psoriasis affects up to 3% of the population; however, there is considerable interracial variation in prevalence. The usual age of onset is 20-35 years. A family history of psoriasis is found in approximately 30% of patients. Evidence indicates that psoriasis is primarily an immunologic T-cell-driven disease requiring participation of both innate and T-cell-mediated mechanisms. Important environmental triggers include infection, drugs, and physical and psychological stress. Three key events characterize the pathophysiology of psoriasis: epidermal hyperproliferation, angiogenesis and accumulation of inflammatory cells. The impact of psoriasis on the patient's quality of life is similar - physically and emotionally - to that of ischemic heart disease, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Psychotic symptoms have been shown to be the single most important cause of nursing home placement in patients with PD. Healthcare costs have been found to be twice as high for patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) than for those without psychosis. Acute psychosis may require hospitalization. Causes for hospitalization include direct safety issues, both for the patient and their family. All antipsychotics carry a black box warning of increased mortality, which should be considered when making treatment plans. Although the FDA generally recommends that attempts be made to lower or discontinue antipsychotic use whenever possible, this should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time.
The common underlying mechanism of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion, with differing degrees of superimposed thrombosis and distal embolization. Although atherosclerosis starts with the development of dysfunctional endothelium in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors early in life, the speed of progression is non-linear, unpredictable and varies markedly between individuals. A vulnerable plaque is prone to rupture or erosion and consists of a thin-capped fibroatheroma that is enriched in cholesterol debris, a large number of inflammatory cells (especially macrophages, some activated T cells), and smooth muscle cells. The major determinants of thrombus generation are those of the classic 'triad of Virchow': thrombogenicity of the exposed plaque material (plaque vulnerability), local flow disturbances (vessel vulnerability), and systemic thrombotic propensity (blood vulnerability). Mural platelet-rich 'white' thrombi most often incompletely block coronary blood flow and are present in unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) is often characterized by the complete obstruction of coronary vessels by thrombi rich in red blood cells and fibrin, which overlay platelet-rich thrombi.

Biologics are typically proteins, ranging in size from simple proteins to large, complex monoclonal antibodies. They are created in living systems. Inherent variability exists for all biologics and creates batch-to-batch variability for all products. Biosimilars are highly similar, but not identical, to their reference (originator) biologic. Furthermore, biologics themselves show inherent variation between batches (microheterogeneity), such that no batch is identical to previous batches. The slight differences between batches of biologics, or between biologics and biosimilars, are authorised and not expected to have any meaningful effect on clinical use. Changes to manufacturing processes can introduce significant changes to the tertiary structure of a biologic; analytics tests (and, exceptionally, new clinical trials) are required to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed.

Treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC without an actional somatic gene mutation consists of systemic chemotherapy; regimen selection is based on histology, comorbidities and performance status (PS). Platinum-based combinations are the backbone of first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. Pemetrexed regimens are restricted to non-squamous histology. Pemetrexed as continuous or switch maintenance prolongs survival over no maintenance in patients with non-squamous histologies and PS 0,1. Bevacizumab combined with a paclitaxel regimen can provide a survival benefit over a paclitaxel regimen alone in patients with non-squamous subgroups. Advanced age alone should not preclude appropriate NSCLC treatment. Two chemotherapy drugs have been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC in the second-line setting: docetaxel and pemetrexed. Platinum re-challenge could represent a potential option for fit, relapsed patients with a platinum-free interval treatment of more than 6 months.

Interim analyses assess the data for efficacy or for futility (or both) while the trial is ongoing and data are still accumulating. Interim analyses have predefined stopping rules for overwhelming efficacy of the experimental treatment, or futility if the experimental treatment does not appear to offer any efficacy advantage over the existing treatment (or against placebo). Multiple analyses have the potential to inflate the type I probability error (multiplicity), increasing the chances of false-positive results. The type I error rate (alpha = 0.05) must therefore be divided across the interim analyses for efficacy. In most schemes to divide the alpha, a substantial amount of the 0.05 is left for the final analysis, with the interim analyses for efficacy having very stringent significance levels. There is usually only one interim analysis for futility, relatively early in the trial. The conditional power recalculates the power of the study based on the interim data under either the current trend or the original assumption. The former assumes the data in the interim analysis reflect the truth, whereas the latter assumes the original assumption about the data is correct.

Disabling multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses should be treated with high-dose (500-1000 mg/day) short-course (3-5 days) intravenous or oral methylprednisolone. Corticosteroid therapy hastens recovery from acute relapse but may not affect ultimate function. There is no indication for prolonged oral steroid therapy following MS relapse. Moderate dose (60 mg/day) oral corticosteroid therapy for optic neuritis may increase the risk of recurrence and should be avoided. MS symptoms including pain, spasticity and sphincter dysfunction are a source of significant disability and should be treated proactively. Spasticity may be severe and is managed in most patients with a combination of physical therapy and oral medication. In severe focal spasticity, botulinum toxin injections have a role. Bladder dysfunction commonly manifests with urinary frequency, urgency and urge incontinence and is ameliorated with anticholinergic therapy in most patients with low urinary residual volumes (< 100 mL). Intermittent self-catheterization should be considered in patients with significant urinary retention (urinary residual volume > 100 mL), and formal urodynamic studies may be indicated to exclude complex bladder dysfunction. Pain in MS most commonly has a neuropathic origin and responds to anticonvulsant therapy or antidepressant (tricyclic or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) therapy. Impaired mobility is a dominant feature of progressive MS, and function should be optimized through multidisciplinary care, provision of appropriate walking aids and, in selected cases, symptomatic treatment with fampridine. Depression complicates the course of MS in up to 40% of patients and should be proactively managed with a program of physical exercise, behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy as indicated.

There are successful models for every stage of obesity, including prevention, childhood obesity and the treatment and management of adult obesity. There is robust evidence indicating the effectiveness of the MEND program for children and the Counterweight program for adults. The obesity prevention program EPODE has had proven success with a whole-community approach to the integration of healthier lifestyles into daily life, including the addition of nutritional education to school curriculums. Since water is the appropriate drink for hydration, a tax on all sugar-containing/carbonated drinks is probably the most logical fiscal measure that governments could implement to tackle obesity. Health professionals have an ethical and moral obligation, and the opportunity, to promote public health as well as taking care of individual patients.

Health professionals have an ethical and moral obligation, and the opportunity, to promote public health as well as taking care of individual patients.
Cardiac cells have the unique ability to depolarize rhythmically; depolarization normally occurs in one direction from the top down, from atria to ventricles. The fibrous atrioventricular (AV) ring, which supports the mitral and tricuspid valves, behaves as an electrical insulator: conduction to the ventricles occurs only over the AV node, unless there is an abnormal or aberrant connection. The AV node has a decremental slowing effect on conduction. Autonomic effects on the heart (sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli) can significantly influence cardiac conduction. Re-entry is the most frequent mechanism for arrhythmias. The substrate for an arrhythmia is an abnormal electrical pathway or a region of scarred myocardium. The trigger is an atrial or ventricular ectopic beat. Narrow QRS complex arrhythmias signify depolarization of the ventricle over the usual His-Purkinje system. Most supraventricular tachycardias have narrow QRS complexes. Wide- (broad-) complex tachycardias need further investigation, and patients should be referred for urgent assessment. They should be considered ventricular in origin until proven otherwise.

Immediate recognition of STEMI with timely initiation of reperfusion therapies is associated with improved outcomes. The selection of reperfusion strategy in STEMI (pharmacological versus invasive) is critically dependent on the time from onset of symptoms, mortality risk of STEMI and bleeding risk. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred choice of revascularization in STEMI patients if it can be offered within 90-120 minutes of diagnosis. Prasugrel and ticagrelor have superseded clopidogrel as the gold standard in dual antiplatelet therapy. In the European guidelines, bivalirudin is the anticoagulant of choice during primary PCI, while enoxaparin has its merits as an adjuvant to thrombolytic therapy. Whereas, in the US guidelines there is no general preference for bivalirudin over unfractionated heparin and there is no recommendation for enoxaparin.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is thought to involve a multistep pathogenesis with a variable mixture of predominantly genetic or environmentally mediated factors. Approximately 90% of cases appear to occur sporadically. The lifetime risk of developing ALS increases with age. A sizable body of epidemiological evidence, albeit mostly retrospectively acquired, supports a common clinical perception of premorbid athleticism and lower body mass index in ALS. Multiple and diverse cellular pathways, many involving cells adjacent to the motor neuron, are implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. An intronic hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 underpins around 10% of all cases of ALS in the Western hemisphere. RNA mishandling is a core theme underlying the aggregated TDP-43 signature that defines the ALS syndrome. Rodent modeling of ALS has been disappointing in terms of human therapeutic translation. Cellular models currently lack the ability to study neuronal network integrity.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder, most often seen in obese or diabetic patients. NAFLD is a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to cirrhosis with liver failure. When associated with obesity, NAFLD is best treated with weight loss. Hemochromatosis is easily treatable but underdiagnosed. It is reasonable to screen patients at risk of hemochromatosis by measuring the transferrin saturation in early middle age.

Duration of untreated psychosis is usually 3-6 months. The longer the delay in treatment, the worse the clinical outcome. Early detection has been shown to be possible. Second generation drugs are preferred. Treatment of prodromal cases with cognitive behavioral or drug therapy may prevent or delay schizophrenia.
Supportive care for patients with leukemia manages the effects of disease activity and progression, as well as the adverse effects of therapy. Transfusion support, with or without the use of blood growth factors, may be required at many points in the disease process and becomes essential to continued survival in the later stages. The prevention and treatment of infection are of paramount importance. It is important not to overlook the importance of cancer-related fatigue. The level and nature of fatigue should be regularly assessed. Failure to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on the first day of chemotherapy increases the risk of CINV on subsequent days and in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. Well-established guidelines for the use of effective antiemetic regimens are available. Patients with leukemia may experience pain caused by the disease itself, complications of the disease, invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment effects or unrelated medical conditions. Management of pain therefore requires a multidisciplinary approach. Surviving cancer can have a profound and lasting impact on patients, affecting both physical and mental health, professional and personal identity, sexuality and financial standing. Patients surviving leukemia may require support in a number of areas. The aim of palliative care is to provide the best possible quality of life for patients with advanced and untreatable disease and their families.

Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited disease. Liver cysts are the most common extrarenal manifestation. Progression to end-stage kidney disease is slow, and does not occur in all patients. Alport's syndrome is an important but rare cause of hematuria. Deafness and eye abnormalities are common in men with Alport's syndrome.

The primary goal of CINV therapy is the prevention of nausea and vomiting. Patients should be individually evaluated for their specific risk factors as well as the level of anxiety present before the first course of treatment. Outcomes are improved by following international guidelines when selecting the antiemetic regimen to use in relation to emetogenicity of the type of chemotherapy involved. The triple-drug regimen of a NK-1 receptor antagonist (RA), 5-HT RA and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The two-drug combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone before chemotherapy is recommended for patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy; no antiemetic should be administered routinely for patients receiving minimally emetogenic chemotherapy. The final choice of antiemetic agent will depend on efficacy, toxicity and cost. To determine overall cost-effectiveness of any given regimen, the acquisition cost of the antiemetic agent should be weighed against the probability and cost of post-chemotherapy visits to the clinic or emergency department and/or admissions to hospital. The incidence and severity of CINV in children is similar ito that in adults. The use of antiemetics in children should follow the same principles as those used to treat adults.

Bladder cancer is a common tumor; each year approximately 17 000 people in the USA die from the disease, and 188 000 globally. Bladder cancer incidence has a male-to-female ratio of 4:1. The incidence increases with age, with a median age at presentation of 60-65 years. Bladder cancer has many etiological risk factors, most of which are avoidable; the most common cause is cigarette smoking. Some familial syndromes and genetic predispositions increase the risk of bladder cancer.

There are three major symptom clusters: positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms and behavioral disorganization. Cognitive impairments and negative symptoms have the greatest prognostic importance for functional outcome. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) provide the two principal diagnostic systems used to diagnose people with schizophrenia. It is important to rate social and functional outcomes, as well as symptoms.

Preventing asthma attacks is the most effective means of controlling asthma. Identifying risk factors that trigger asthma attacks and removing allergens and irritants from the patient's environment can reduce the frequency of symptoms and hospitalizations for asthma, and decrease the need for medication. Immunotherapy is helpful in some patients when one of the following applies: - specific allergens can be shown to be causative - allergen avoidance is not possible - symptoms are not controlled by conventional medication. A written self-management plan empowers patients to manage their asthma optimally. Failure to respond to treatment may result from non-adherence to the prescribed treatment. Attention must be paid to the patient's ability to take their inhaled therapy correctly. Identifying problems surrounding care and creating a patient partnership with agreed treatment goals can facilitate adherence.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a rare group of lymphomas that affect the skin. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the commonest type of CTCL and typically presents in the early stages with patches and plaques. Early-stage MF may progress to advanced disease with skin tumors and blood involvement, with lymph node or visceral spread. Some patients (30%) present with advanced disease. Early-stage MF has an excellent prognosis and long survival (10+ years), whilst the advanced stages are rapidly progressive in 1-4 years. Sézary syndrome is the erythrodermic form of CTCL that presents in advanced disease with leukemic blood involvement. Cutaneous lymphomas may be CD30+, and this group forms a spectrum from lymphomatoid papulosis with relapsing and remitting lesions to large cell anaplastic lymphomas that may grow rapidly. These types of CTCL have an excellent prognosis and should be differentiated from transformed MF, which also has large atypical CD30+ cells. Other forms of CTCL are rare and include subcutaneous panniculitis-like lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder.

Smoking should be regarded as a primary chronic relapsing disease. All serious attempts to quit should be maximally supported with behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Repeated efforts by the physician are required to provide sufficient motivation for a quit attempt. Relapses are common, and should engender repeated attempts. Smoking cessation activities should be an integrated part of every medical practice.

Smoking prevalence varies across countries from less than 20% to more than 60% in men, and from less than 5% to more than 30% in women. Smoking prevalence is higher in men than in women in almost every country. In industrialized English-speaking countries (which have all implemented tobacco control measures), smoking prevalence has declined markedly, and in countries such as the UK and Australia with strong anti-tobacco policies it continues to decline. In western industrialized countries, smoking prevalence is greater among people with lower educational level and greater socioeconomic disadvantage. Most smokers smoke every day, and in the USA and the UK 70% smoke within 30 minutes of waking. Most smokers start during adolescence; initial take-up and transition to regular smoking are linked to both genetic and social factors. In most developed countries, most smokers want to stop smoking, usually because of health concerns and cost, and try to do so many times.

Eye disease cannot be accurately diagnosed without a slit-lamp microscope examination. If in any doubt, refer the patient. Carry out a basic eye assessment by:- identifying the presenting symptoms- taking a complete patient history- performing as thorough an examination as you can with the equipment you have available. Test visual acuity (VA) in every patient who complains of blurred vision. Test the visual field to confrontation to detect disease that would be missed by testing for VA alone. Perform the 'swinging light test' to check for a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in all patients who complain of blurred vision, flashes, floaters or visual field loss. The presence of an RAPD signifies serious retinal or optic nerve disease. In patients with red eye/s, the use of a blue light and fluorescein drops may identify a corneal ulcer that is invisible with white light alone. Although useful for viewing the optic disc, the commonly available handheld direct ophthalmoscope is not a particularly good instrument for examining the retina. Patients who exhibit 'normal fundoscopy' with the direct ophthalmoscope can still have serious disease that is detectable only by examination with the slit-lamp microscope and retinal lenses. Use your patients' eye symptoms and signs to triage them according to their need for referral to an ophthalmologist: those with serious eye emergencies who require urgent referral, those with non-urgent problems who require routine referral and those whom you can observe or treat yourself. - identifying the presenting symptoms - taking a complete patient history - performing as thorough an examination as you can with the equipment you have available.

Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, and a leading cause of cancer death among women. The highest incidence rates are seen in non-Hispanic white women, and the lowest in African or Asian women. Survival rates in ovarian cancer are the lowest of any gynecologic malignancy, largely because the majority of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are the most important genetic factors contributing to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the genetic risk factors known at present account for less than half of the excess risk of the disease. Oral contraceptive use is strongly protective against ovarian cancer. Risk-reducing surgery (salpingo-oophorectomy) is recommended for high-risk women up to the age of 45 years. To date, large screening trials based on CA125 measurement and transvaginal ultrasound have failed to show any significant benefits in terms of reducing deaths from ovarian cancer.

Digital medicine holds the promise of bringing complex medical measurements, observations and interventions outside the clinic. Clinical research uses include interventional and non-interventional trials, although many practicalities and data management issues are yet to become commodities. Regulation of digital medicine varies widely across the globe.
Smoking is an essential vital sign; it is imperative that patients' smoking status be recorded and the record kept up to date. A physician's advice on smoking has a positive effect and need take as little as 30 seconds. The advice should focus, taking a small amount of time in routine consultations at least once a year, on telling all smokers about the best ways of stopping rather than berating smokers or just advising them to stop.

Depression is two to three times more common among people experiencing medical conditions, as physical illness increases the risks for depression and, vice versa, depression makes physical illness more likely. When depression and physical illnesses are combined, the course and outcome of both conditions are worsened, with increased disability, higher medical costs and greater likelihood of adverse outcomes (including death). People with depression are less likely to adhere to treatments for medical conditions or to adopt healthy behaviors and self-management for these health problems. Recognizing depression in people with physical health problems can be challenging, but being alert to the increased risk and using validated case-finding measures assist this process. There is a good evidence base for managing depression combined with medical conditions: selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are an appropriate first line drug treatment, and psychological therapies are effective.

Nivolumab should be considered as a second-line treatment option for patients with non-squamous cell histology whose tumors are positive for programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and all patients with squamous cell histology. Pembrolizumab should be considered as a treatment option for all patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive. Generally, programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors have a similar side-effect profile and efficacy. Combination strategies with both cytotoxic T-lymphoma-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antagonism and first-line chemotherapy offer better response rates; however, caution needs to be exercised with the inherent risk of increased toxicity. Strong PD-L1 staining is a biomarker for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition.

A structured behavioral support program involving several sessions concentrated in the first few weeks after the quit date can significantly increase smokers' chances of stopping permanently. Sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride (Zyban) and nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT, in the form of chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalator, lozenges, sublingual tablets, mouth spray or dissolvable oral strips) increase smokers' chances of stopping considerably. The highest quit rates can be achieved with either varenicline (Chantix/Champix) or dual-form NRT (patch plus one of the other forms of NRT). NRT, varenicline and bupropion are among the safest medicines available, although bupropion carries a small risk of seizure and allergic reaction (about 1/1000). Electronic cigarettes have become very popular and may help many smokers to stop smoking. They are much safer than conventional cigarettes, even if used long term. Concerns exist around the way some of them are being marketed and the variability in quality. Nortriptyline and cytisine are both effective at helping smokers to stop and are very cheap. Cytisine (available in much of Central and Eastern Europe for several decades and available over the counter) offers a safe and effective low-cost treatment that can be given with minimal supervision. It has yet to receive a marketing license in most of the world. A combination of behavioral support and medication quadruples the chances of a successful quit attempt; these treatments are among the most cost-effective life-preserving interventions available to health professionals. Hypnotherapy and acupuncture have received little research attention in relation to smoking cessation; to date, no specific effect in aiding smoking cessation has been found.

A structured behavioral support program involving several sessions concentrated in the first few weeks after the quit date can significantly increase smokers' chances of stopping permanently. Sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride (Zyban) and nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT, in the form of chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalator, lozenges, sublingual tablets, mouth spray or dissolvable oral strips) increase smokers' chances of stopping considerably. The highest quit rates can be achieved with either varenicline (Chantix/Champix) or dual-form NRT (patch plus one of the other forms of NRT). NRT, varenicline and bupropion are among the safest medicines available, although bupropion carries a small risk of seizure and allergic reaction (about 1/1000). Electronic cigarettes have become very popular and may help many smokers to stop smoking. They are much safer than conventional cigarettes, even if used long term. Concerns exist around the way some of them are being marketed and the variability in quality. Nortriptyline and cytisine are both effective at helping smokers to stop and are very cheap. Cytisine (available in much of Central and Eastern Europe for several decades and available over the counter) offers a safe and effective low-cost treatment that can be given with minimal supervision. It has yet to receive a marketing license in most of the world.

Early liquid peripancreatic collections without necrosis are called acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFCs). APFCs lasting for more than 4 weeks develop an encapsulating wall and are known as pseudocysts. Early collections associated with pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis are called acute necrotic collections. Those lasting for more than 4 weeks and developing an encapsulating wall are known as walled-off necrosis. In the revised Atlanta classification, acute pancreatitis is defined as mild, moderately severe and severe. Mild disease is defined by the absence of complications, severe disease as persistent (> 48 hours) organ failure; patients with other local and systemic complications are classified as having moderately severe disease. Mild disease is associated with an uneventful disease course. Moderately severe disease results in increased morbidity and severe disease is associated with maximum morbidity and increased mortality.

Precision medicine in oncology matches an individual patient to the correct treatment, based on the biological and molecular features of the patient's cancer. The FDA recognizes a pathway of three levels of biomarkers, based on the clinical evidence necessary to support NGS tests. Multidisciplinary MTBs, comprising various medical disciplines, facilitate the incorporation of molecular diagnostics and interpretation of results into therapeutic decision-making for a patient with cancer. A basket trial is a biomarker-driven study in which a single treatment and single biomarker are tested in patients with different histologies. An umbrella trial is a biomarker-driven study in which participants with a single histology and multiple biomarkers are each matched to a particular treatment.

Brain metastases (BM) are common in the natural history of patients with NSCLC. The Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) score, which is based on age, Karnofsky performance score, the presence of extracranial metastases and the number of BM, can guide clinicians' decisions. Surgical resection may be required for patients presenting with neurological symptoms or a large single lesion. Whole brain radiotherapy was the standard treatment for patients with a poor prognosis, but this has recently been challenged. Stereotactic radiosurgery could be given to patients with a limited number of small well-defined BM, as it provides excellent local control with limited toxicities. Systemic treatment (chemotherapy or targeted compounds) is a reasonable treatment option for asymptomatic patients.

The treatment of eating disorders requires a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, involving the primary care physician, psychiatrist and nutritionist. The ultimate goal of treatment is both psychological and physical health. Psychological health comprises: healthy eating behaviors with no restricting or purging; the elimination of obsessions regarding body image, bodyweight and food; normal adaptive functioning in school/work and interpersonal relationships; and coping with normative stressors. Physical health is measured by the restoration of ideal bodyweight and return of menses. There are many complications, acute and chronic, associated with eating disorders that require ongoing management. Weight gain is crucial in order to restore menses and increase bone density.

The treatment of lymphoma often involves multiple modalities: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and/or high-dose therapy with stem-cell support. Chemotherapy is administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously or intrathecally. Some side effects are common to all chemotherapy agents, such as fatigue, nausea and bone-marrow suppression, but some are agent specific. For complex chemotherapy regimens, indwelling venous catheters are often used but they carry the risks of infection and thrombosis. Radiotherapy kills cells by causing damage to the DNA. Side effects of radiotherapy include damage to local tissues in the radiation field and an increased risk of secondary cancers. These effects are minimized by using fractions (which also increases efficacy) and by careful planning. Monoclonal antibody therapy with rituximab (anti-CD20) has revolutionized the treatment of both high- and low-grade lymphomas, and indications for this agent are likely to expand. High-dose therapy with autologous stem-cell support is useful for patients with certain types of relapsed lymphoma and may be indicated as part of first-line therapy for very aggressive lymphomas. High-dose therapy with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is a toxic procedure, but it may result in cure, particularly in cases of low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A number of small-molecule pathway inhibitors are currently in development, several of which show very encouraging activity.

Depression has been evident as a problem for individuals and societies since antiquity, but public and professional awareness has markedly increased over the past half-century. Although much progress has been made in clarifying the clinical features and distribution of depression within populations, significant debate remains and there are ongoing difficulties about how to best understand and manage depression, particularly in its milder forms. Improved knowledge about the features, course and management of depression has enabled more prompt recognition, evidence-based treatment decisions and improved outcomes. However, depression is still both under- and over-diagnosed, and therapies are not always targeted appropriately: many depressed people do not receive treatment that could help them whilst prescribing for patients with mild or uncertain symptoms remains evident.

As several simultaneous statistical tests are usually conducted (exempli gratia for several different endpoints or time points, for the overall sample and several subgroups), the potential for a significant p -value to occur purely by chance increases. The overall type I error rate, known as the family-wise error rate must be controlled in every trial at 5%. The Bonferroni correction divides the 0.05 equally across all endpoints; for example, for four endpoints, the significance level for each endpoint would be 0.05/4 = 0.0125. The decision to do this must be made in the study protocol. The Hochberg approach places the p -values in order, from largest to smallest, and then assigns a different significance level to each; for example, <= 0.05 to the largest, <= 0.025 (0.05/2) to the next and 0.017 (0.05/3) to the next, and so on. In hierarchical testing (or closed testing), the endpoints of interest are ranked from most important to least important before the study begins. The endpoints are then tested in that order using 0.05 as the significance level. The statistical significance can only be claimed down to the first non-significant result. Attention should not be refocused on strong subgroup results because of the problem of multiplicity. If there is a good clinical argument that supports a strong effect in a subgroup, then that subgroup should be built into the confirmatory testing strategy from the beginning of the study. Forest plots are a good way of graphically displaying the results of subgroup analyses.

Gene therapy involves the addition of nucleic acid-based products to a cell, either to compensate for a pathogenic loss of a protein or suppress the expression of a toxic protein. The transfer of genetic material may be transient or permanent, with non-viral and viral vectors, and it can be executed in an ex vivo context or directly in vivo. Clinical translation of a gene therapy agent has many hurdles to overcome. These range from identifying the target gene and designing the drug for efficient specific delivery of the required levels of expression to considering the genotoxic and immunologic risks. Monogenic diseases lend themselves to treatment using gene therapies. Ex vivo manipulation of hematopoietic stem cells is paving the way to clinical approvals.

Tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) are useful for the management of hemorrhage following trauma and surgery in many different clinical settings. Tranexamic acid or EACA should not be given to patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or those who may be bleeding from the upper urinary tract. Desmopressin will often provide effective hemostatic therapy in mild hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease and some platelet disorders. A fibrinolytic inhibitor may be given concomitantly to inhibit the activity of the released tissue plasminogen activator. The antidiuretic effect of desmopressin lasts for 24 hours and can lead to clinically significant water retention and hyponatremia. It should not be given to those with atherosclerosis because of the risk of precipitating a thrombosis. Topical agents provide local hemostasis, but those that contain animal proteins or are prepared from human blood convey risks of antibody formation and infection transmission.

Risk is a poorly understood concept - it has negative connotations when in reality it is neutral. Risk measures the likelihood that an event will take place. Risk is a proportional quantity; change in risk can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. Consequence represents the severity of effect of an event. Decision-making involves balancing of risks and considering trade-offs.

Patients may experience unexplained symptoms for years before diagnosis: prodromal non-motor symptoms, such as impaired sense of smell, constipation and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, develop in the majority of patients. Care must be taken in delivering the diagnosis. It is best if the patient is accompanied by a spouse, partner or other family member, and information may need to be repeated 2-3 weeks later when the shock has subsided. It is important to address both non-motor and motor symptoms, and to treat both social and motor disability. Early treatment is important; quality of life deteriorates in those who delay treatment. Maintaining an active lifetyle, both physically and mentally, is important. All patients will eventually experience motor (and often non-motor) fluctuations, with a 'wearing off' of the benefit of their initial medication. Patients should be reassured that the increasing motor disability and complications of late-stage Parkinson's disease do not tend to occur until the eighth or ninth decade of life; not all patients will reach this stage of Parkinson's disease.

The diagnosis must be clearly established by radiological, endoscopic and/or functional tests. Risk factors such as smoking and alcohol should be discouraged. Medical measures must be optimized. Beside medical treatment, severe pain may need endoscopic or surgical intervention. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, which may develop within the chronic pancreatitis.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as a further UTI after resolution of initial bacteriuria. At least 20-30% of women will have a UTI at some time, 25% of whom will develop recurrent UTI. UTIs are relatively rare in men and are more likely to have a significant cause than in women. Urinalysis is quick and easy. A positive test should be followed up by microscopy, and the urine cultured to determine antimicrobial sensitivity. Treatment of UTIs is largely on the basis of symptoms and any underlying identified cause. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for recurrent UTI; prophylactic antibiotics and self-medication should also be considered. Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is characterized by suprapubic pain relating to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms such as frequency, in the absence of a proven UTI or other pathology. The diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) is confined to patients with bladder pain symptoms with characteristic cytoscopic and histological features. The etiology of BPS/IC is largely unknown. The roles of cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in the diagnosis of BPS/IC are controversial. Management of BPS/IC is largely conservative, and includes dietary advice, behavioral therapies, and oral and intravesical medication.

Combined oral contraceptives are not recommended for women with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) because of the risk of thrombosis. MPN increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including early fetal loss and pre-eclampsia. Antithrombotic therapy for pregnant women at risk of vascular complications consists of aspirin, possibly with phlebotomy in women with polycythemia vera. Low-molecular-weight heparin and cytoreductive therapy with interferon (IFN)-alpha may be considered in women at high risk of complications. Hormone replacement therapy should only be used in perimenopausal women with no other risk factors for venous thromboembolism or a history of thrombosis. There is currently no risk stratification specifically for children with MPN, although a history of life-threatening venous or arterial thrombosis should be considered high risk, warranting cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea or IFN-alpha) The treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis requires a multidisciplinary approach. All patients should receive long-term anticoagulant therapy, and patients with thrombocytosis require cytoreductive therapy; some patients may require invasive intervention. There are few data to inform treatment decisions in patients with MPN undergoing elective surgery. Best practice indicates optimizing blood counts and a clear plan for anticoagulants.

Accurate prognostication is important when considering the risk versus benefit associated with different approaches to treatment. The World Health Organization system classifies patients' 'risk' based on molecular pathology. Age is an important and independent adverse risk factor, and older patients (> 60 years) have particularly dismal outcomes with conventional treatment. Age and certain cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities increase the risk of multidrug resistance to chemotherapy. Understanding of the molecular genetics of acute myeloid leukemia has increased in the last decade, and several mutations, either alone or in combination, have been shown to have a significant bearing on prognosis. European LeukemiaNet includes these genetic abnormalities in its risk stratification. Molecular markers can be used within the cytogenetically defined risk groups to further refine the prognostic risk and may influence the choice of consolidation therapy. The presence of measurable residual disease after induction chemotherapy indicates a high risk of relapse.

Liver transplantation is effective for a wide range of liver diseases. Thorough assessment is mandatory and must cover physiological, social and psychiatric comorbidity. Many diseases recur after transplantation, but with variable consequences. Careful attention to the complications of immunosuppression is of great importance; possible opportunistic infections, drug interactions and side effects can occur. Limitations to lifestyle after transplantation are remarkably few.

Drug-induced liver injury is common and usually mild. Determining the temporal relationship between starting a drug and the development of symptoms and signs of liver disease is important. Discontinuation of offending agents usually results in prompt resolution of hepatic injury. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be appropriate for some medications, such as statins and isoniazid.

Various dermatological disorders can resemble psoriasis, including other inflammatory dermatoses, infections and neoplasms. Medical and family history and physical examination, along with laboratory findings, are all important in establishing the correct diagnosis.

Schizophrenia was first clearly identified in the 1890s. Its characteristic features were an early onset and a chronic course. Kraepelin described two characteristic psychopathological processes. Bleuler introduced the concept of primary and secondary symptoms.
Primary brain tumors and metastases have been diagnosed with increasing frequency over recent decades. This may reflect a true increase in incidence, but improved neuroimaging techniques and greater access to imaging account for part of this increase. Environmental risk factors for the development of brain tumors are poorly understood and are probably over-reported. Developments in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics are resulting in an exponential increase in our knowledge about all types of brain tumors.
An urgent CT scan of the abdomen should be performed if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Prognostic evaluation for the severity of the disease should be completed within the first 3 days of symptom onset. It should be determined whether gallstones are the cause of the attack; if so, urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy should be performed in severe cases; all cases of acute biliary pancreatitis usually require cholecystectomy. If severe acute pancreatitis with extensive necrosis is found beyond the first week, fine needle aspiration for bacteriology and fungi should be performed; if there is proven infected necrosis, pancreatic necrosectomy might be required. If the etiology is uncertain, endoscopic ultrasonography should be performed following resolution of the attack to exclude unusual causes of obstruction such as small stones or tumors.

Obesity is associated with potentially serious physical and psychological consequences; almost every system in the body may be affected (see The health risks of excess weight ). The distribution of excess body fat determines the nature of the adverse consequences of obesity. Obese patients should be assessed for obesity-related comorbidities. Consider and manage obesity in all patients presenting with problems that may be related to obesity, or where obesity may confer a risk (surgery, pregnancy). The metabolic consequences of excess weight may respond to as little as 5-10% weight loss; much greater weight loss is required for other comorbidities (exempli gratia obstructive sleep apnea).

The main goals of treatment for bulimia are abstinence from bingeing and purging, learning and maintaining healthy eating behaviors, and addressing any other psychological issues related to the condition. Psychological interventions are the mainstay of treatment; symptoms of bingeing and purging and other aspects of eating disorders respond better to psychotherapy than to medication alone. Up to 70% of patients benefit from a combination of cognitive-behavior techniques and pharmacotherapy. Higher doses of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are used for the treatment of bulimia than for depression, with careful monitoring of side effects. Fluoxetine is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bulimia; it is also licensed for this use in the UK. Regular moderate exercise may help patients to deal with the weight fluctuations that can be expected while their bodies adjust to new healthy eating patterns.

Persistent hyperglycemia is the primary factor responsible for nerve damage in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic neuropathy (DN) affects the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems. Maintenance of near-normal blood glucose levels is the best approach to primary and secondary prevention of DN. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and anticonvulsants are the medications of choice for neuropathic pain, but side effects are common. Pregabalin is specifically approved for DN. Duloxetine has also gained approval for DN in some countries. Combining medications that address different mechanisms (exempli gratia SNRIs or TCAs with gabapentinoids), while being mindful of drug interactions, can be helpful for treatment-resistant cases, and may enable smaller doses of one or both drugs to be given, which may reduce the total side-effect burden. Although efficacy in clinical trials is established, the use of opioids for the treatment of neuropathic pain remains controversial because of safety and overdose concerns, particularly in at-risk individuals, such as those with substance use disorder or psychiatric comorbidities, or those using benzodiazepines or other sedatives. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is pain that persists after the vesicular rash of herpes zoster has resolved. During an attack of acute herpes zoster (shingles), reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), previously dormant in the dorsal root ganglia, induces inflammation and neuronal destruction. TCAs and anticonvulsants are useful therapies for PHN; the physical, psychological and social consequences of PHN should also receive attention. Once developed, PHN is difficult to manage and thus efforts to prevent PHN are crucial via: prevention of VZV infection, boosting VZV immunity, treating at the time of acute herpes zoster infection, and effective treatment of the acute pain.

COPD results from pathological changes in the large and small airways (bronchiolitis) and in the alveolar space (emphysema). Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as the production of sputum on most days for at least 3 months a year over at least 2 consecutive years. Inflammation occurs in large and small airways, and in the alveolar space, most commonly involving a number of cells including neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ lymphocytes. Small-airways disease or bronchiolitis can result in inflammation and eventually scarring of the small airways; this is an important pathological change in COPD, which is difficult to assess by respiratory function tests, but may be a major source of airway obstruction. Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema is the most common form of emphysema, particularly in smokers, and is distributed mainly in the upper zones of the lungs. Panacinar (panlobular) emphysema has a more diffuse distribution, predominantly in the lower zones of the lungs, and is associated with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; it can also occur in some smokers. Bullae are emphysematous spaces over 1 cm in diameter. Combinations of these pathological changes to varying degrees in different individuals with COPD contribute to the airflow limitation. The lungs of patients with COPD show an amplified and persistent inflammatory response to the inhalation of particles and gases, particularly those in cigarette smoke. A protease:antiprotease and oxidant:antioxidant imbalance is part of this amplified inflammatory response. Once COPD is established, the inflammatory process persists even after smoking cessation.

Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema is the most common form of emphysema, particularly in smokers, and is distributed mainly in the upper zones of the lungs. Panacinar (panlobular) emphysema has a more diffuse distribution, predominantly in the lower zones of the lungs, and is associated with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; it can also occur in some smokers. Bullae are emphysematous spaces over 1 cm in diameter. Combinations of these pathological changes to varying degrees in different individuals with COPD contribute to the airflow limitation. The lungs of patients with COPD show an amplified and persistent inflammatory response to the inhalation of particles and gases, particularly those in cigarette smoke. A protease:antiprotease and oxidant:antioxidant imbalance is part of this amplified inflammatory response. Once COPD is established, the inflammatory process persists even after smoking cessation.
COPD results from pathological changes in the large and small airways (bronchiolitis) and in the alveolar space (emphysema). Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as the production of sputum on most days for at least 3 months a year over at least 2 consecutive years.

The most frequent presentation of acute pancreatitis (AP) is severe epigastric pain radiating to the flanks and/or back, nausea and vomiting. Most patients are diagnosed based on typical pain and increased serum pancreatic enzyme activity greater than three times the upper limit of normal. Diseases other than AP may be associated with increased pancreatic enzyme serum activity. Differential diagnosis is important as most of these conditions require specific treatment. Abdominal imaging is useful for confirming the diagnosis of AP in atypical cases, ruling out other conditions.

Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as a consolidation strategy is an option for patients who achieve a complete response with front-line chemotherapy. Phase II studies have shown that about 40% of patients who undergo ASCT at first remission are disease free at 5 years. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) provides long-term disease control in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and as a front-line consolidation for patients with more aggressive PTCL subtypes. Complications from alloSCT include serious infections resulting from immune suppression, and chronic graft versus host disease. In a randomized study, outcomes were similar with upfront ASCT and alloSCT, with more patients in the autologous arm relapsing and more in the allogeneic arm experiencing transplant-related morbidity and mortality.

Serotonin (5-HT ) receptor antagonists (RAs) (ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, dolasetron and palonosetron) have their main antiemetic effect during the acute CINV phase. Neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, rolapitant and netupitant) have their main antiemetic effect during the delayed CINV phase. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone in particular) have a significant role in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed CINV, and are an essential part of almost all antiemetic regimens in clinical practice. A combination of a triple antiemetic regimen of a 5-HT RA, an NK-1 RA and a corticosteroid is very effective in antiemetic prophylaxis for patients receiving cispatin, AC (anthracycline and cyclophosphamide)-based and highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) regimens. Recent data have shown that a combination of a triple antiemetic regimen of a 5-HT RA, an NK-1 RA and a corticosteroid is very effective in the prophylaxis of moderately emetogenic chmeotherapy (MEC) regimens, in particular carboplatin-based treatment. 5-HT RAs, NK-1 RAs and corticosteroids are not very effective in the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea.

The quality attributes - chemical, physical, and biological properties - of a biologic must be within a development corridor that defines the acceptable upper and lower limits of the marketed product. The regulations were originally developed to cover variation in batches of biologics resulting from manufacturing changes, including procedures to ensure that batches of originator biologics were within the development corridor.
The first approach to treatment is to look for contributing factors such as infection, metabolic disorders or non-PD-related psychoactive medications. Only clozapine and pimavanserin have proven efficacy for Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). While clozapine works quickly, pimavanserin requires 4-6 weeks to improve psychotic symptoms. Although clozapine doses are one-tenth to one-hundredth of those used in schizophrenia, the risk of granulocytopenia and agranulocytosis is thought to be unchanged, so close blood monitoring is still required. Quetiapine is widely used (on the basis of open-label reports) even though there is no clear evidence of efficacy and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including mortality risk. Cholinesterase inhibitors confer overall benefits in people with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, with some evidence of a specific beneficial effect in the treatment of psychosis. Further work is needed to determine potential benefits of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment for PDP in the absence of dementia. Trials of novel pharmacological and psychological treatment approaches are now being initiated; this is likely to be an evolving field over the next 5 years.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not one disease, but a syndrome that overlaps with frontotemporal dementia. ALS is primarily a progressive motor-predominant syndrome. There is significant variability in the clinical evidence of upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The initial regional patterns of body involvement vary, but generalized involvement over time is the norm. Variation in the speed of symptom progression is not closely tied to any single phenotypic classifier. Symptom onset is focal and tends to spread contiguously. Neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions of transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43) are the consistent histopathological feature in nearly all cases.

There is significant variability in the clinical evidence of upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The initial regional patterns of body involvement vary, but generalized involvement over time is the norm. Variation in the speed of symptom progression is not closely tied to any single phenotypic classifier. Symptom onset is focal and tends to spread contiguously. Neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions of transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43) are the consistent histopathological feature in nearly all cases.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered in addition to drug treatment reduces persistent positive symptoms. CBT can also abort relapses if targeted at early signs. Cognitive remediation is effective in reducing cognitive impairments, although generalization to global functioning is an issue.
Screening for diabetes should be undertaken annually with a fasting glucose level. Always consider diabetes mellitus in high-risk populations, including those with a family history, the obese, corticosteroid recipients and transplantation recipients.

Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may be due to anatomic stenosis or a spastic functional disorder, and is most common after cholecystectomy. A lot of controversy surrounds this topic. Data suggest that sphincterotomy is not more effective than a sham procedure in patients with type III dysfunction, leading some to suggest type III dysfunction may not be a real disease. Sphincter of Oddi manometry is the diagnostic gold standard for the dysfunction. Biliary or pancreatic duct pressure of more than 40 mmHg is diagnostic of biliary or pancreatic sphincter dysfunction, respectively. A low gallbladder ejection fraction of less than 35-40% on Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan with gallbladder stimulation may be diagnostic of gallbladder dyskinesia (functional gallbladder disorder), and is the best predictor of response to cholecystectomy. The pain of gallbladder dyskinesia is reproduced in some patients when cholecystokinin is administered.

Topical therapy is a key component of nearly all acne regimens. Topical therapy should be selected to help achieve medical adherence. Realistic expectations of therapy should be explained. Combining therapies or using fixed combination topical products improves efficacy by targeting more than one pathogenic feature and enhancing treatment adherence. Topical antibiotics can lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance. Topical antibiotics should not be used as single agents for the treatment of acne. Topical retinoids are useful as first-line agents. Any regimen containing an antibiotic (topical or oral), including a topical antibiotic/retinoid combination should be combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce and prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of P. acnes.

Early relapsing MS is a multifocal inflammatory demyelinating and degenerative disease that affects both the white and gray matter. MS leads to a diffuse change in the white matter, which explains the brain atrophy that occurs early in the disease course. Although still considered to be an organ-specific autoimmune disease, loss of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in newly forming MS lesions is a critical event that may trigger or amplify the inflammatory cascade that characterizes active demyelination. Resolution of inflammation, restoration of axonal impulse propagation and remyelination mediate recovery from discrete clinical relapses in early disease. Molecular reorganization of demyelinated axon membranes, characterized by a greater than normal sodium channel density, permits the restoration of continuous impulse propagation in non-remyelinated fibers. As the disease advances, the pathological complexity of MS increases. Multifocal adaptive inflammation is progressively replaced by a diffuse 'degenerative' phase, although these two facets of MS neuropathology are probably inextricably linked. Current therapies effectively target the inflammatory pathology that peaks in early disease but, until recently, have failed to arrest the progression of established 'neurodegeneration' or promote endogenous repair mechanisms such as remyelination; we are on the cusp of a new era in MS therapies, with the first remyelination study showing positive effects.

Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase suggest injury to hepatocytes. An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase suggests injury to structures of the biliary tree. Prothrombin time (after vitamin K) and serum albumin are used to assess the liver's ability to synthesize proteins. Increases in serum bilirubin occur for many reasons, but generally indicate severe disease. A liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver disease.

Stress incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine on exertion. It is far more common in women than in men. Risk factors for stress incontinence in women include pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and obesity. Prostatectomy is the main cause in men. Behavioral modification, including pelvic floor muscle exercises, is effective in women and men when taught correctly, and a number of devices are available to assist with training. The surgical procedure of choice in women is insertion of a retropubic or transobturator tape mid-urethral sling to provide support for the urethra. Other alternatives in women are colposuspension and injection of bulking agents. Options for management in men include injection of bulking agent into the urethral sphincter, insertion of a perineal sling or artificial urinary sphincter.

Onset of hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis in non-obese individuals under 25 years of age is suggestive of monogenic diabetes (more commonly referred to as maturity onset diabetes of youth - MODY). A positive family history of diabetes in two to three generations should raise this suspicion. Conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis and pancreatic carcinoma can cause hyperglycemia. Glucocorticoids can unmask a susceptibility to type 2 diabetes or cause hyperglycemia at high doses. Anti-HIV drugs increase insulin resistance. Pentamidine can cause ketosis-prone diabetes. Renal, cardiac and lung transplantation increases the risk of diabetes.

Kaplan-Meier curves are used to display data on a time-to-event endpoint. Cumulative incidence functions are used with a composite endpoint when there is interest in separating out the different components of the composite. Forest plots display results for subgroups in a clinical trial, or across a series of trials in a meta-analysis. The change in tumor burden from baseline over a treatment period or through to the end of follow-up at the individual patient level can be displayed in a waterfall plot. Swimmer plots also identify key events during treatment at the individual patient level. Box and whisker plots look at the distribution of data and can be used for laboratory parameters, vital signs and QTc intervals over time or across different tumor types. Relative risks for adverse events can be displayed for the most frequent adverse events to highlight where treatment differences lie. Concerning increases in laboratory parameters from baseline can be identified by plotting, relative to the normal range, the baseline value on the x -axis and the maximum value over time on the y -axis in trellis plots.

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. The highest prevalence is seen in affluent westernized populations. In many countries asthma, along with other allergic disorders, continues to increase in prevalence, especially in children and young adults. Death from asthma reflects poor access to healthcare in many countries. Asthma can occur at any time in life, although it most commonly develops in infancy and childhood. There is evidence that early life events, including those that occur in the womb, may be important in the initiation of childhood asthma in those genetically at risk. Although asthma disappears in 30-50% of children during puberty, it often recurs in adulthood. There is no evidence that regular use of corticosteroids in early life alters the natural history of asthma, though these medications are highly effective in disease control.

Comorbidity and obesity are baseline characteristics associated with worse outcomes. Early increases in serum blood urea nitrogen or hematocrit are associated with worse outcomes. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, particularly when persistent (>= 48 hours), is associated with an increased frequency of local and systemic complications. In general, scoring systems for predicting severity have a high negative predictive value and a low-to-moderate positive predictive value.

Any of the following symptoms require urgent ophthalmic referral:- flashing lights (other than the visual prodrome of migraine)- new-onset floating spots- visual field loss- visual distortion- photophobia (sensitivity to light)- pain in the eye (even if vision is normal and the eye is not red)- symptoms of temporal arteritis (if the patient is over 50). A combination of flashing lights and floating spots may indicate a retinal tear or detachment. Visual distortion is almost always a symptom of serious macular disease. Photophobia or eye pain may indicate early iritis or acute glaucoma. Urgent referral of patients with symptoms of temporal arteritis could save their sight or their life. - flashing lights (other than the visual prodrome of migraine) - new-onset floating spots - visual field loss - visual distortion - photophobia (sensitivity to light) - pain in the eye (even if vision is normal and the eye is not red) - symptoms of temporal arteritis (if the patient is over 50).
Four generations of biosimilar have been developed, from the simple hormone replacement molecules to complex monoclonal antibodies used for chronic inflammatory disorders and cancer, and more than 30 are now approved in the EU, but only six in the USA. There has been no indication that the biosimilars have any meaningful difference in safety or efficacy from their originator biologics, based on more than 700 million patient-days' exposure to European-approved biosimilars over the last 10 years. Uptake of biosimilars has varied by therapy area and geography, ranging from 1% to 90%; some surveys report persistent concerns among clinicians about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars. The introduction of the biosimilar filgrastim led to a dramatic increase in use whilst realizing cost savings because fewer patients required treatment for neutropenia; it also drove down the price of a long-acting version of filgrastim that was still patent protected. Managed programs in which savings from switching could be reinvested in staffing have realized substantial savings. Competitive pricing has also reversed health technology assessments for erythropoietins by improving the cost-effectiveness of treatment.

Chronic complications of diabetes may be microvascular or macrovascular. Many different types of neuropathy affect diabetic patients, with some being very debilitating. All diabetic patients must be screened for the presence of retinopathy and referred for ophthalmic review where necessary. Intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF agents are now considered the gold standard of therapy for eyes with center-involving macular edema and reduced vision. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic renal failure in western societies. Treatment of diabetic nephropathy with blood-pressure reduction and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors slows disease progression. Neuropathy and ischemia increase the risk of foot ulceration, which is associated with enormous healthcare costs. Major vascular disease accounts for more than half of all deaths in diabetes. Lowering of blood pressure to 130/80 mmHg is associated with a considerable reduction in vascular morbidity and microvascular disease. Failure of erection occurs in 38-55% of men with diabetes. It is important to recognize psychological stress and depression in patients with diabetes, as lifestyle changes associated with the condition can be overwhelming for some.

Lowering of blood pressure to 130/80 mmHg is associated with a considerable reduction in vascular morbidity and microvascular disease. Failure of erection occurs in 38-55% of men with diabetes. It is important to recognize psychological stress and depression in patients with diabetes, as lifestyle changes associated with the condition can be overwhelming for some.
Chronic complications of diabetes may be microvascular or macrovascular. Many different types of neuropathy affect diabetic patients, with some being very debilitating. All diabetic patients must be screened for the presence of retinopathy and referred for ophthalmic review where necessary. Intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF agents are now considered the gold standard of therapy for eyes with center-involving macular edema and reduced vision. Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic renal failure in western societies.

The preferred approach to revascularization depends on the extent and severity of the lesions, potential infarct complications and the patient's condition and comorbidities. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with superior restoration of myocardial blood flow, lower rates of reinfarction and mortality and less intracranial bleeding than pharmacological intervention with fibrinolytic therapy. The use of drug-eluting stents is preferred as they reduce the risk of reintervention compared with bare-metal stents. Approximately 10% of patients with acute coronary syndromes undergo coronary artery bypass grafting during initial hospitalization.

Myelofibrosis has the most diverse presentation of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and carries the worst prognosis. Approximately 30% of patients are asymptomatic initially but all patients eventually develop symptoms of bone marrow failure and progressive splenomegaly. The aims of treatment include reduction of anemia and splenomegaly and alleviation of constitutional symptoms. Risk stratification is currently based on the International Progression Scoring System (IPSS) or Dynamic IPSS but new systems that incorporate genetic and cytogenetic risk factors, such as the Mutation-Enhanced International Prognostic Score System (MIPSS70) and MIPSS70-Plus are being developed. Anemia can be treated in the short term with androgens, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and immunomodulators, but most patients eventually become transfusion-dependent. Splenomegaly can be managed using cytoreductive agents, splenectomy, radiation therapy or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Approximately 80% of patients treated with hydroxyurea will require additional therapy within about 1 year.- Splenectomy is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity but may be an option for patients with drug-resistant splenomegaly. The JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is indicated as first-line therapy in patients with splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms. Low-dose fractionated radiotherapy is the current standard of care for extramedullary hematopoiesis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is potentially curative but is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity and is therefore reserved for high-risk patients, possibly those who are transfusion dependent or who have an unfavorable karyotype. Treatment response should be monitored by blood counts, assessment of symptoms using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-Symptoms Assessment Form Total Symptom Score, and objective measurement of spleen volume. - Splenectomy is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity but may be an option for patients with drug-resistant splenomegaly.

Painless hematuria is the most common presentation of bladder cancer. A single episode of hematuria should prompt urgent referral to a urologist. Unexplained irritative symptoms may be due to bladder cancer, particularly carcinoma in situ. Recurrent infections may indicate an underlying tumor. Delay in treatment adversely affects prognosis. Hematuria clinics allow rapid diagnosis and reduce time to treatment.

Loss-of-function mutations can potentially be repaired through gene addition, exon skipping to restore the transcript reading frame, gene editing and upregulation of compensatory genes. Gain-of-function mutations can potentially be treated genetically through endonuclease-mediated gene editing, RNA interference using small interfering (si)RNA or short hairpin (sh)RNA, and antisense oligonucleotides targeting translation start codons, polyadenylation signals or out-of-frame exons. Ex vivo and in situ in vivo gene therapies are - particularly for eye disorders - associated with enhanced safety and targeted efficacy relative to direct systemic in vivo therapy. Non-viral vector delivery, despite generally having safer outcomes than viral delivery, is limited by transient transgene expression and the need for re-administration, which may lead to accumulated toxicological issues. Viral vector delivery has the advantage of persistence of transgene expression, though there are associated genotoxic and immunologic risks that limit efficacy and patient applicability. Preclinical research is focused on improving the safety profiles and manufacturing costs of viral vectors.

Symptomatic hypoglycemia is common in patients with type 1 diabetes. Hypoglycemia is a barrier to the achievement of tight glycemic control. Frequent hypoglycemia may lead to the development of hypoglycemia unawareness. There are many and varied causes of hypoglycemia. Death from hypoglycemia is rare.
Medical management of heart failure (HF) with preserved systolic function remains challenging, but in principle should target the underlying cause (exempli gratia blood pressure, coronary ischemia). Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists are the mainstay of therapy for symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The new angiotensive receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan and the selective sodium-potassium channel inhibitor ivabradine should be considered in patients who remain symptomatic despite therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB and beta-blocker. Inotropic agents are used short term in acute cases with severe cardiac dysfunction (cardiogenic shock) and can be supplemented by mechanical circulatory support (exempli gratia intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device). Acute HF is a medical emergency and the treatment has to be tailored to the underlying clinical problem (lowering blood pressure in severe hypertension, revascularization in acute myocardial infarction).

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the conducting airways. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of airflow limitation which, depending on the severity of the attack, can cause breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness, cough and, rarely, death Structural changes also occur in the airways; these are particularly evident in those with severe and chronic asthma. The structural abnormalities in asthma include thickened basement membrane, mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and mast cells within the airway smooth muscle. Airway inflammation in people with asthma is not uniform: in most it is eosinophil predominant, but in others neutrophil cell types predominate. The most prominent risk factors are allergen exposure in genetically susceptible individuals and maternal cigarette smoking. Genetic factors determine susceptibility to environmental factors, and it is the interaction between these that leads to clinical disease.

Genetic and environmental factors both play a role in the etiology of RA. A number of genetic associations with RA have now been identified. Smoking is an important environmental trigger that, in shared-epitope-positive individuals, stimulates the production of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs). Autoantibodies appear up to 15 years before clinical disease is manifest, suggesting a further influence of additional environmental triggers at a later time point. Subclinical inflammation starts to manifest approximately 5 years before disease onset.

Up to 40% of patients with anorexia are readmitted to the hospital at least once for weight restoration and nutritional rehabilitation; the length of stay becomes longer with each successive hospitalization. Cognitive-behavior therapy and other psychotherapeutic techniques are an integral part of most multimodal treatment programs for anorexia, for both outpatients and inpatients. Patients with anorexia can be treated with antipsychotic medication in dire situations and in crises, as these medications become effective relatively quickly. Appropriate targets are the patient's obsession regarding weight and body shape (which often resemble a delusion), extreme anxiety regarding re-feeding, and psychotic states. Some second-generation atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole have a more favorable side-effect profile than the traditional antipsychotics, including a higher ratio of serotonin-to-dopamine blockade and weight gain. Tricyclic antidepressants are not recommended for the treatment of patients with anorexia because of the potential for arrhythmia at low bodyweight, a risk of lethal overdose and concern surrounding sudden death in young people. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can target anxiety and depression if efficacy is not of immediate concern. They have a more manageable side-effect profile than the atypical antipsychotics, but treatment should be monitored carefully for suicidality, weight gain or loss, emotional activation and agitation. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of SSRIs in preventing relapse in weight-restored individuals.

Although the in-hospital mortality is higher in patients with STEMI than those with UA/NSTEMI, the 6-month mortality rates are similar and the 4-year mortality rates are two times higher in patients with UA/NSTEMI. Early invasive strategy followed promptly by revascularization is increasingly preferred over conservative strategy. Antithrombotic therapy is a fundamental strategy in patients with UA/NSTEMI; however, proper risk assessment is essential to determine an optimal strategy that achieves a maximum anti-ischemic effect associated with an acceptable bleeding risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) and a P2Y receptor blocker is the standard of care in patients with UA/NSTEMI; however, optimal duration of therapy is controversial. Guidelines uniformly recommend starting all UA/NSTEMI patients (without contraindications) on an anticoagulant as soon as possible after presentation. The benefits of triple therapy of ASA, P2Y receptor blocker and warfarin/oral anticoagulant have not been clearly established. The role of direct oral anticoagulants for long-term therapy is being studied in large-scale trials. Since patients with UA/NSTEMI have a high risk of recurrent ischemic events, active long-term management strategies are crucial.

Urgently refer all patients (of any age) with new-onset double vision to an ophthalmologist, ideally to be seen the same day. Double vision may be due to disease of the orbit, extraocular muscles, neuromuscular junction, ocular motor nerves or brain. It is often very difficult to accurately diagnose the cause on examination. Brain aneurysms - which can be fatal if they are not urgently diagnosed and treated - are a not infrequent cause of double vision in adults; patients often present with partial or complete third nerve palsy. Pupil size is not a reliable indicator of whether an aneurysm is present. Overall, the most common cause of diplopia in adults is ischemic third, fourth or sixth cranial nerve palsy. Temporal arteritis should always be excluded.

Psoriatic arthritis is often underdiagnosed and undertreated; however, it is important to recognize this disease because advances in therapy offer the prospect of more complete disease control. The classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis are highly specific and sensitive. Traditional oral therapies may be effective for some clinical domains of psoriatic arthritis. All available anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and demonstrate significant ability to control signs and symptoms, improve function and quality of life, and inhibit progression of structural damage of joints. New therapies with a different mechanism of action from TNF inhibition, ustekinumab and apremilast, have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis; other promising therapies are in development. Optimal management requires a team approach between dermatologist, rheumatologist and primary care provider.

Issues that may reduce the effectiveness of CINV control by healthcare professionals include underestimation of the incidence of CINV, concerns about the adverse effects and cost of antiemetic agents, and insufficient following up after chemotherapy. Patient factors that may reduce the effectiveness of CINV control include under-reporting of symptoms and poor adherence to medications. Incorporating antiemetic guidelines in electronic medical record prescribing orders may help to ensure prescription of optimal antiemetic regimens by healthcare professionals. Clinicians must emphasize the importance of continuing medications at home and completing the full course of treatment. Telephone follow-up by oncology nurses with patients 24-48 hours after chemotherapy will provide important patient information.

Receptor-targeted therapies ('biologics') target specific molecules involved in the immunopathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. The biologics currently available or in clinical trials are all given by injection (subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous). Evidence to date suggests that biologics have fewer organ-specific toxic effects than traditional systemic agents. Reduction in the inflammatory systemic components of other organs (exempli gratia joints and heart) is a positive development. A number of exciting new agents are in various stages of development and clinical trials. Cost and long-term safety will be important in determining the future role of biologics in the treatment of psoriasis. Biosimilar agents, soon to be introduced, could help to reduce cost issues considerably.

Pathological anticoagulants A pathological anticoagulant should be suspected when major unprovoked bleeding occurs in a previously well person. Pharmacological anticoagulants Serious bleeding associated with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may be controlled by platelet transfusion and, if minor but troublesome, with desmopressin. A decline in hemoglobin in a patient receiving an anticoagulant should prompt an exhaustive search for a source of bleeding. Coumarins should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients with poor oral intake. The direct factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors currently available do not have specific antidotes and should be used cautiously in patients at risk for bleeding (those with renal failure, liver disease, previous stroke or history of hemorrhage). Thrombolytic agents Thrombolytic agents are associated with a risk of intracranial hemorrhage of nearly 1%; they should be administered in intensive care units and stopped immediately if signs of bleeding appear.

Coumarins should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients with poor oral intake. The direct factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors currently available do not have specific antidotes and should be used cautiously in patients at risk for bleeding (those with renal failure, liver disease, previous stroke or history of hemorrhage). Thrombolytic agents Thrombolytic agents are associated with a risk of intracranial hemorrhage of nearly 1%; they should be administered in intensive care units and stopped immediately if signs of bleeding appear.

A number of product characteristics and manufacturer processes need to be considered when adopting a biosimilar. A biosimilar may have effects that impact nursing time, patient comfort and ease of use, and these should be evaluated at the outset. Economic estimations should address the potential direct and indirect costs of the biosimilar versus the reference drug.

Patients with heart failure (HF) should undergo regular monitoring for early diagnosis of anemia and appropriate investigation to determine the cause. Therapeutic intervention should be tailored to the individual, taking into account the velocity of hemoglobin fall, the presence or absence of concomitant renal dysfunction and the cause of the anemia. Despite inherent diagnostic limitations it is important for clinicians to establish the presence of pulmonary disease and to introduce early therapy for both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HF in order to limit their negative impact on morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing is important as treatment with continuous positive airway pressure in symptomatic patients is effective. HF therapy is challenging in the context of comorbid renal disease, as vasodilators may precipitate an increase in serum creatinine and potassium levels; however, current evidence supports the use of these drugs in patients with CRS type 1 providing the initial increase in serum creatinine and potassium are less than 30% and 5.6 mmol/L, respectively. Acute ischemic hepatitis may develop in HF with low-output state and is generally reversible. Clinical depression is not uncommon in patients with HF and is associated with a marked increase in HF morbidity and mortality. Initial screening for depression is therefore important.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level should reliably fall to below 0.1 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy. Recurrence after prostatectomy is generally defined as PSA above 0.2 ng/mL and rising. Recurrence after radiation therapy is usually defined as PSA that is at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir. For the average patient, metastases do not develop until 8 years after a PSA rise is detected, with death some 5 years later, so watchful waiting is an appropriate option for some men with recurrence. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT can be used to evaluate men who have a PSA rise after local treatment. Following prostatectomy, patients who have a high likelihood of local disease can be offered salvage radiotherapy. Following radiotherapy, patients who have recurrence in the prostate only may be offered a salvage treatment such as radical prostatectomy, High-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) or cryotherapy, but all of these carry the risk of side effects. Progressive PSA rises following initial therapy suggest micrometastatic disease, which should be treated with hormone therapy; however, the timing of this treatment is controversial. More evidence is needed from clinical trials to inform us of the most effective treatment options in these situations.

Identifying depression is the necessary first stage to enable ongoing monitoring, risk assessment, support and clinical management; however, many people with depression are not identified in primary care or medical settings. A combination of patient, clinician and contextual factors operate to hinder depression identification, but these factors can all be modified to improve the process of condition recognition. Interventions to improve recognition that do not incorporate changes to the context and organization of care are likely to have only weak effects on depression outcomes. The best evidence indicates the effectiveness of a combined approach involving education for clinicians and patients, systematic use of case-finding tools, and organizational changes to improve depression management capacity and sustain practice changes.

A diagnostic biomarker of most immediate value in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) would be one that can help the neurologist distinguish atypical (exempli gratia LMN-predominant) cases from other disease states for earlier therapeutic trial enrolment. Neurofilaments are a leading candidate, especially if the blood-based assays become sensitive enough to supersede the need for cerebrospinal fluid testing. Urinary p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) levels have also shown promise. Threshold-tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation is sensitive to the cortical hyperexcitability that characterizes the syndrome of ALS. Motor unit nerve estimation and electrical impedance myography are emerging developments beyond standard electromyography. Multimodal structural and functional brain imaging may provide more sensitive markers of broader motor system dysfunction in the longer term.

The differential diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency includes a heterogeneous group of acquired and congenital hemolytic disorders. The direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemias. False-positive and false-negative results should be taken into account. Several infectious, microangiopathic, mechanical, toxic and pharmacological causes of acquired hemolytic anemias should also be considered. Patient history and blood smear examination are fundamental in the diagnosis of congenital membrane defects, including hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and stomatocytosis. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis are recessive anemias to be considered and diagnosed mainly by molecular analysis. A complex group of enzyme defects (mostly recessive) are diagnosed by testing the enzymatic activity in the peripheral blood and by confirming the causative mutation at a molecular level (homozygous or compound heterozygous).

Inherited genetic mutations are associated with about 15% of ovarian cancers, depending on the histological subtype. Most guidelines recommend that all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer should be referred for genetic counseling and testing, irrespective of their family history. Cascade screening of close blood relatives of individuals found to carry specific genetic mutations can markedly reduce testing costs, because it is only necessary to test for the specific mutation. Referral rates to genetic counseling services are low, despite numerous guideline recommendations, because there are still significant funding issues.
Urgently refer patients who present with any of the following signs:- acute red eye with proptosis (forward movement of one or both eyes) (possible orbital cellulitis)- bilateral optic disc swelling (possible papilledema from brain tumor or accelerated hypertension)- unequal pupils plus double vision (possible partial third nerve palsy from posterior communicating artery aneurysm)- an abnormal (dull or white) red reflex and/or white pupil in children (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract). It is very important to perform ophthalmoscopy, looking for optic disc swelling, on all patients who complain of headache; bilateral disc swelling may be the first and only sign of a brain tumor. - acute red eye with proptosis (forward movement of one or both eyes) (possible orbital cellulitis) - bilateral optic disc swelling (possible papilledema from brain tumor or accelerated hypertension) - unequal pupils plus double vision (possible partial third nerve palsy from posterior communicating artery aneurysm) - an abnormal (dull or white) red reflex and/or white pupil in children (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract).

Patients with acute coronary syndromes, particularly NSTEMI, remain at heightened risk for long-term recurrent cardiovascular events. The goal of secondary prevention strategies is to reduce cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, the burden of angina, and other ischemic events. More than 90% of the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with modifiable risk factors. Secondary prevention trials are therefore mainly targeting the modifiable risk factors such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity and smoking. Despite many secondary prevention programs, patients with CAD do not achieve treatment targets regarding lifestyle changes, risk factor modification and therapeutic strategies, and there are huge gaps in applying evidence to routine practice. Strict adherence to medications, improved awareness and education programs targeting patient and healthcare providers are needed.

The aims of treatment in polycythemia vera (PV) are to reduce the risk of primary or recurrent thrombosis and to control symptoms, but without increasing the risk of hemorrhage or disease transformation. Current treatment strategies focus on reducing the elevated hematocrit resulting from excessive red blood cell production, and aspiring to decrease the risk of thrombosis. Treatment is stratified according to the level of risk. All patients should receive low-dose aspirin and undergo regular phlebotomy to reduce the hematocrit. These measures may be sufficient in low-risk patients whereas those at higher risk may require cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha or other agents. A significant proportion of patients develop resistance to hydroxyurea, necessitating repeated phlebotomy at increasingly shorter intervals to control the hematocrit, indicative of inadequate disease control. The Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib may be useful in patients with hydroxyurea-refractory PV.

Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is characterized by an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 40%. The European Society of Cardiology has defined a new category of heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), characterized by an EF of 40-49%. Left ventricular HF is the most common type of HF. Symptomatic HF affects 2-3% of the global population. The financial burden associated with HF is likely to rise over the next 20 years. Coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease and diabetes mellitus are the four most important predisposing conditions for the development of HF.

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) ameliorate CNS inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), effectively reducing the relapse rate and the accumulation of new brain lesions identified on MRI. Early introduction of DMT, even at the clinically isolated syndrome stage, may be advantageous. Conversely, immune-directed DMT is not effective in patients with established secondary progressive MS. DMTs can be given in injectable, oral or intravenous form. Newer DMTs, such as natalizumab, alemtuzumab and fingolimod, are significantly more effective than injectable agents, but carry modest risks that must be considered when making treatment choices in individual patients. A treatment escalation strategy is appropriate for most patients with mild to moderate disease. Clinical and radiological parameters should be carefully monitored for evidence of disease activity in this paradigm. Induction therapy for MS is a new concept, using one of the 'stronger' MS medications, to 'reset' the disease course. Early institution of efficacious newer-generation therapies should be strongly considered in patients with rapidly evolving MS. Cytotoxic immunosuppression and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are reserved for patients with MS that is refractory to available DMT.

Early institution of efficacious newer-generation therapies should be strongly considered in patients with rapidly evolving MS. Cytotoxic immunosuppression and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are reserved for patients with MS that is refractory to available DMT.
Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) ameliorate CNS inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), effectively reducing the relapse rate and the accumulation of new brain lesions identified on MRI. Early introduction of DMT, even at the clinically isolated syndrome stage, may be advantageous. Conversely, immune-directed DMT is not effective in patients with established secondary progressive MS. DMTs can be given in injectable, oral or intravenous form. Newer DMTs, such as natalizumab, alemtuzumab and fingolimod, are significantly more effective than injectable agents, but carry modest risks that must be considered when making treatment choices in individual patients. A treatment escalation strategy is appropriate for most patients with mild to moderate disease.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) account for approximately 65% of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs); lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) make-up 25%, and the remaining 10% are rare diseases. Clinicopathological correlation is crucial in the diagnosis of CTCLs, as the histological findings do not always correspond with the clinical behavior, and many benign dermatoses can mimic the histopathology of MF and other CTCLs. CTCL is generally subdivided into neoplasms with indolent and those with aggressive clinical behavior. Indolent forms have a good prognosis and prolonged course, and often lack systemic symptoms. They are usually treated with skin-directed therapies. Aggressive forms have a poor prognosis, and are associated with systemic symptoms that warrant systemic treatment. They generally display a cytotoxic immunophenotype. CTCL is a relatively rare group of diseases with an estimated incidence of 6.4 per million persons. Onset most often occurs around the sixth decade of life in white people, with earlier onset in African-Americans. African-Americans have statistically significant higher incidence of both MF and non-MF CTCL, and often present with more advanced disease. Patients with CTCL have an increased risk of secondary malignancies. No familial link in CTCL has been identified.

Urinary tract obstruction is common and can lead to irreversible kidney failure if not recognized. An infected obstructed urinary system is a urologic emergency. Renal cell carcinoma often presents late, while transitional cell carcinoma of the kidney pelvis causes obstruction and presents early. Targeted therapies are expanding the treatment options for both benign and malignant kidney tumors.

At least 2.3 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is more common in women than men (2-3:1), and the incidence of MS in females is rising. The prevalence of MS is increasing worldwide, with a greater prevalence in populations of northern European descent. There is a 'latitudinal gradient' of MS, that is, a higher prevalence and incidence of MS in areas of higher latitude (remote from the equator). There is an association between low levels of vitamin D and prevalence (and possibly severity) of MS. Most people with MS have been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). People who have had infectious mononucleosis have a twofold higher risk of developing MS. The rate of MS is higher in smokers and in those with exposure to passive smoking than in those who have never smoked. MS has a heritable component, but the condition is not related to a single gene (multiple gene interactions are likely to be involved); the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele DRB1*1501 has a strong association with MS in Caucasians.

T cells develop in the thymus and are part of the innate and adaptive immune system. They recognize and respond to specific antigens, producing a tailored response to invading pathogens. Mature T cells express a surface T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes fragments of antigen as peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Thymocytes do not express CD4 or CD8 initially (double-negative) but become double-positive during development, after which one molecule is downregulated. CD8 + T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) recognize antigens presented by the MHC class I molecules found on nucleated cells. CD4 + T cells, of which there are several subtypes, recognize antigens presented by MHC class II molecules, which are only present on specialized antigen-presenting cells. Natural killer (NK) cells derive from the same common lymphoid progenitor as T cells but develop primarily in the bone marrow. They produce inflammatory cytokines and directly kill infected cells without prior priming or activation. While NK cells are typically considered part of the innate immune system, recent evidence suggests that they are also important in adaptive immunity.
Biologics have provided major advances in treatment of many chronic diseases but are a burden on health budgets that is predicted to increase with changing demographics. Biosimilars provide a lower-cost option to replace original-brand products. In the era of biosimilars, payers, clinicians and patients can benefit from a greater choice of biologics and, through price reductions, access to these treatments can increase. Prescribing a biosimilar is in keeping with the concept of rational prescribing, which includes a cost imperative.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. It can affect the ocular, bulbar, facial, neck, respiratory and limb muscles. The symptoms of MG may be exacerbated by concurrent illness, over-exertion of the muscle, the use of certain medications, and as the day progresses. All patients suspected of having MG should be tested for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies. If these antibodies are present, no further diagnostic testing is usually required other than the use of imaging to determine if a thymoma is present. AChR-antibody-negative patients with predominant bulbar involvement are often tested for muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies and, where available, antibodies to clustered AChR. (It should be noted, however, that clustered AChR antibody testing is available only at a few specialist centers, and is not routinely performed in general laboratories.) Patients who are antibody negative should be tested for a decrementing response on repetitive nerve stimulation, elevated jitter values on single fiber electromyography or a positive edrophonium test. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are often the initial therapeutic intervention in patients with MG. Most patients with MG require additional treatment with either thymectomy or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy. Consideration of additional therapeutic options is warranted for patients who are identified as being refractory to conventional treatment.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are usually caused by driver mutations in the JAK2, MPL and CALR genes. The most common JAK2 mutation is V617F, which activates downstream signaling via erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and thrombopoietin receptors. This mutation is associated with all three MPNs, whereas MPL and CALR mutations activate mainly the thrombopoietin receptor and hence are only associated with ET and PMF. Numerous other somatic mutations have also been implicated in the initiation and progression of MPN, including mutations that affect intracellular signaling pathways, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors and RNA splicing. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) refers to the acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenia and dysplastic hematopoiesis. Rarely, CHIP can progress to acute myeloid leukemia, either directly or via myeloid neoplasia or myelodysplastic syndrome; it can therefore be considered a precursor of hematopoietic neoplasms. Inflammation appears to play a key role in the development of PMF and other MPNs. Other factors, particularly older age and genetic predisposition, may also influence the initiation and development of these conditions.

The value, type and role of follow-up in cancer care is not well defined and prospective randomized trials are scarce. The type of follow-up depends on whether the patient has undergone fertility-sparing surgery. Serial CA125 measurements have failed to show any survival benefit over observation alone. Follow-up should involve holistic aspects and psycho-oncologic support. Palliative surgery should be performed only after all conservative management options have been exhausted. Short bowel syndrome is a common complication after palliative surgery for bowel obstruction in relapsed disease.

Suicide is strongly associated with depression, but despite depression being more common among adult women, men are around twice as likely to kill themselves in most countries, and three to four times more likely in many high-income nations. Self-harm is most common in adolescent girls and young women and usually does not involve an intention to endanger life. Nonetheless, a history of self-harm is an important predictor of future suicide, increasing the risk by 50-100-fold compared with people who have not self-harmed. In addition to previous self-harm, risk factors for suicide include depression, substance misuse, a family history of suicide, male sex, being separated or divorced, and being in custody. Assessment practice following self-harm needs to be sensitive and skilled, focusing on the presence of risk factors for suicide and basing care plans on clearly defined risks and the capacity of the individual and their support network to manage problems and take responsibility for safety.

'Intended-copy' biologics manufactured in countries with less stringent regulation than the EU and USA may not be true biosimilars and clinical equivalence cannot be assumed. Inaccurate use of terminology has clouded the distinction between biosimilars and intended-copy biologics.

Hip and knee replacement surgery is well established and may be one of the most effective therapies for these joints. Other surgical techniques include joint preservation and joint fusion but currently are not widely adopted in the setting of severe hip or knee osteoarthritis. Appropriate education, advice and rehabilitation should be provided, both preoperatively and postoperatively, for people undergoing surgery.

Breast cancer is becoming understood as a constantly evolving series of defects in cellular regulation and control. Growth, invasion and metastasis are related but distinct regulatory processes. The mix determines the clinical course in an individual. Most breast lumps are benign, especially those in women younger than 50 years of age. Staging of breast cancer, including examination of lymph nodes, is a prognosis-estimating procedure. Axillary surgery is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic as it achieves local control. New evidence is emerging that the systemic response to the trauma of surgery may induce angiogenesis at the site of latent/occult distant metastases. This may well be amenable to perioperative manipulation of the tumor microenvironment. Gene array techniques are bringing modern molecular biology into the clinic.

Approximately 70% of patients (those with mild or moderate disease) can be managed using topical therapy alone. Time spent detailing the practicalities of topical therapy with patients is crucial to achieving a successful therapeutic outcome. A wide variety of topical therapies is available; topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs, or a combination of both in a single preparation, are considered first-line therapy for most patients. Efficacy and cosmetic acceptability are key determinants of patients' adherence to therapy. Consideration should be given to the body site being treated, since this influences which active ingredient and formulation to prescribe.

General non-pharmacological strategies, including self-care education, treatment adherence, symptom recognition, weight control, sodium and fluid management and healthy lifestyle choices are as important as heart failure (HF)-specific medications. Patients with HF appear to benefit from exercise as much as others, with a documented improvement in quality of life and a tendency towards reductions in morbidity and mortality. Patients with a private driving license are generally restricted from driving only if they have advanced or uncontrolled HF; those with a commercial driving license are banned from driving until further testing. Most patients who have had an episode of acute HF should be able to fly, if stable, in 6 weeks. There should be no restriction for patients with chronic HF, although those with NYHA class III or IV should consider airport assistance and request the availability of in-flight oxygen. In general, there is no convincing evidence that electromagnetic interference, cosmic radiation or vibration have an important effect on the function of pacemakers or implantable cardiac defibrillators.

Typical examples of time-to-event analyses include overall survival, progression-free survival, disease-free survival and duration of response. Censoring is a common feature of all time-to-event endpoints. Observations are said to be censored when the event of interest has not happened by the end of the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier curves plot the probability of being event free over time. The curves from different treatment groups can be plotted against each other to show the differences in outcome. Treatment differences are often expressed as a hazard ratio (HR). An HR of 1 means the risk in the two groups is the same. An HR > 1 means that the risk in one group is higher than the other, and vice versa. The logrank test compares the two Kaplan-Meier curves to provide a p -value for the difference in total survival experience of the two groups. This test can only be used if there is a constant HR, id est the Kaplan-Meier curves start together at time zero and then separate out gradually with time. If the HR is not constant, a treatment difference can be expressed as the difference between two restricted mean survival times (which is equal to the area between two Kaplan-Meier curves). The stratified logrank and the Cox proportional hazards model are two ways of adjusting for imbalances in baseline factors. Baseline variables that are important prognostic factors (exempli gratia age and stage of disease) should be taken into consideration in all statistical analyses, even in randomized studies.

Electrophysiological studies, disease severity rating scales and patient-reported outcome measures are all tools with which disease activity and response to treatment can be measured in myasthenia gravis (MG). There is no reliable correlation between serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titers and clinical severity in generalized MG; better prognostic biomarkers for MG are needed to better assess response to treatment over time. Measurement of jitter on single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) may be a useful biomarker of disease activity in MG. Absolute or percentage change in mean jitter from one electrophysiological study to another has a potential role as a biomarker provided the parameters of the study, such as time of day and time after medication, are kept the same. The quantitative MG score, which can be completed in 20-30 minutes and requires no specialized equipment, is the best studied objective outcome measure in MG. It is recommended for use in all prospective studies of therapy for MG. Other useful tools for assessing response to treatment include the MG activities of daily living score (MG-ADL), MG composite scale (MGC), revised MG quality of life 15 scale (MG-QOL15R), MG impairment index (MGII) and MGFA assessment of post-intervention status (PIS).

Engineered endonucleases can be designed to target virtually any DNA sequence of choice using bioinformatics tools. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages associated with each type of endonuclease. The endonuclease-mediated double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA is repaired by two mechanisms: efficient but imprecise non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or inefficient but precise homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ and HDR mechanisms can be exploited to repair loss-of-function mutations or disrupt gain-of-function mutations. Ex vivo and in situ in vivo applications of gene editing are being tested in the clinic, with a number of systemic in vivo trials starting.

The investigation of a patient with suspected bladder cancer should include urinalysis, cross-sectional upper-tract imaging and cystoscopy. Expert pathological review of biopsy specimens is critical to determining appropriate treatment. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) is used to stage invasive disease. Urinary markers are not yet sufficiently sensitive for diagnosis but may be useful in following up patients with superficial disease.

Tobacco smoke exposure accounts for 90% of all lung cancers. Smoking prevention and cessation represents the major target for prevention of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The National Lung Screening Trial showed that low-dose CT screening of high-risk individuals reduced the risk of lung cancer-related mortality by 20%. The management of solitary pulmonary nodules is dependent on their risk stratification, evidence of growth on interval imaging (ideally using volumetric measurement) and patient comorbidities and choices.

Heart failure (HF) has a poor prognosis with an annual mortality of 25-50% depending on severity of symptoms and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Poor prognostic signs include impaired renal function, marked prolongation of QRS, hypotension and hyponatremia. The search for reversible factors is always indicated. The model of palliative care for advanced HF needs to be very flexible, individualized to the needs of the patient and their family. Good communication skills are the key to effective palliative care delivery. Primary care, cardiology and palliative care teams should work in collaboration to deliver an effective phase-specific treatment in advanced HF. End-of-life planning and decision making are essential and should be discussed early in the process.

Systemic antibiotics remain useful therapy for inflammatory acne. Antibiotic-resistant Propionibacterium acnes is an emerging problem, and prescribing should take this important factor into account. Antiandrogen hormonal therapy may be helpful in female patients. Oral isotretinoin should be considered in patients with severe scarring acne and those who have relapsed or are not responding to conventional therapy. Oral isotretinoin is teratogenic; careful monitoring is mandatory. Mood changes, depression and suicidal ideation have been described in patients taking isotretinoin, but the drug has not been shown to be the cause; nevertheless, patients should be informed of the possibility.

T-cell lymphomas comprise only 5% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases in Western countries. T-cell lymphomas often involve the skin. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas present with widespread small-volume lymphadenopathy, but with marked systemic symptoms. Most T-cell lymphomas are aggressive and often progress during treatment.

The different types of CINV are classified according to the time interval at which nausea and vomiting occurs in relation to the administration of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy agents vary in their emetogenicity; for example, cisplatin has high emetogenic potential and causes CINV in almost all patients who do not receive antiemetic prophylaxis. Important individual patient characteristics contribute to the risk of developing CINV. Despite guideline-directed antiemetic prophylaxis, CINV can occur with relatively high frequency in high-risk patients (20-25% acute CINV, 50-70% delayed CINV, 50% breakthrough CINV and 30% refractory CINV). The guideline-directed use of antiemetic agents has been shown to prevent emesis in approximately 50-70% of patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The prevention of nausea has been much less successful with currently approved agents.

Most patients with ovarian cancer present at advanced stages of disease, and thus require chemotherapy. The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is the standard of care for the front-line treatment of ovarian cancer. Options for adjuvant therapy include standard chemotherapy, dose-dense chemotherapy and intraperitoneal treatment. A key component in the choice of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy is the ability to cytoreduce, ideally to 'no gross residual tumor'. Women who have a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to less than 1 cm (ideally to no visible disease) should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among the current standards of care, the choice of therapy is generally based on a number of considerations, including patient characteristics, physician preference and regulatory status.

Mycosis fungoides (MF) can be categorized according to nine stages, from IA to IVB. Stages IA-IIA are considered early-stage disease and have a good prognosis, while stages IIB-IVB are advanced stage disease and progress rapidly. Early-stage lesions of the skin include patches and plaques. Advanced-stage skin lesions include tumors and erythroderma. Some patients with early-stage disease will have near-normal life expectancy, while advanced-stage survival is 1-4 years. Poor prognostic indicators for survival in MF include increasing age, raised lactate dehydrogenase, lymph node involvement and large cell transformation in the skin.

Adjuvant hormonal treatment and chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence of breast cancer by 33% and improves survival. The absolute benefit for an individual woman depends on her initial risk. For women with strongly estrogen-receptor(ER) positive breast cancer, endocrine treatment is the mainstay of treatment, and the additional benefit of chemotherapy should be calculated. Postmenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer should be offered an aromatase inhibitor as part of standard adjuvant treatment. Trial evidence supports a further 5 years of hormone therapy in patients who have already received 5 years of tamoxifen -tamoxifen for premenopausal women and an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women. Women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer should be offered anti-HER2-targeted therapy (provided there are no medical contraindications) as part of standard adjuvant treatment. Taxane-based chemotherapy is recommended for women at high risk (node positive and high-risk node negative). Well-designed and managed clinical trials remain the preferred context for treatment.

If a patient presents with a red eye of unknown cause, with one or more of the 'five Ps' (see page 22 ), they have a 'bad' red eye. Refer all patients with 'bad' red eye immediately and urgently - emergency treatment can often save the patient's sight. Do not prescribe any treatment for a 'bad' red eye. Underlying causes of 'bad' red eye include acute glaucoma, iritis, infective corneal ulcer, scleritis and endophthalmitis. If a patient presents with one or two red eyes, but without pain, photophobia or blurred vision, and the eyes are otherwise normal on examination, they have 'good' red eye/s. You can treat these patients yourself; however, they should be referred if they do not begin to improve within 2 weeks, or if their condition worsens. Underlying causes of 'good' red eye/s include bacterial, viral and allergic conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, episcleritis, dry eyes and blepharitis. The only eye drops you should prescribe without an ophthalmologist's opinion are artificial tears, antibiotics (for bacterial conjunctivitis) or mast-cell inhibitors (for allergic conjunctivitis). Do not prescribe steroid eye drops without advice from an ophthalmologist, as they can exacerbate infections, and cause cataracts and glaucoma.

A greater understanding of MS pathogenesis, from genetic susceptibilities and mechanisms of immune-mediated tissue injury through to the molecular basis of impaired tissue repair, has facilitated the development of new treatments for the disease. The spectrum of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) available to the MS clinician is expected to significantly expand over the next 5-10 years. Therapies being investigated include novel small-molecule immunomodulators, targeted immune-directed monoclonal antibodies, hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem-cell therapies, re-engineering of previous MS medications and molecules that promote remyelination and repair. Treatments such as autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be appropriate for the treatment of patients with highly active relapsing disease that has not responded to other DMTs, or as an inducing agent to 'reset' the course of MS. Laquinimod may have a novel mechanism of action that targets innate immune cells; it appears to affect disability progression and brain volume loss more than relapse rate. Anti-LINGO antibody is the first remyelination-promoting therapy to reach Phase II clinical trials in optic neuritis. Treatments that overcome molecular obstacles to remyelination may complement immune-directed therapies for MS in the future. Progressive MS may soon have a number of therapeutic options; the first is likely to be ocrelizumab. Ocrelizumab may soon receive FDA approval as the first DMT for progressive MS.

Next-generation sequencing has identified distinct DNA mutations in AITL and Tfh-related lymphomas, and recurrent mutations in other PTCL subtypes. Whole-genome studies should provide further insight across all PTCL subtypes. The integration of gene sequencing and multiomic analysis should help to identify vulnerabilities beyond aberrations of genetic sequences for drug targeting. The use of needle biopsies in patients with PTCL yield limits samples for molecular studies. However, circulating tumor DNA from peripheral blood may be an alternative. Patient-derived xenograft PTCL models may facilitate the development of new treatments and increase our understanding of PTCL biology. Given the high rates of chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes for most patients with PTCL, novel precision medicine strategies are needed. A plethora of new drugs is in development, including monoclonal antibodies against T-cell receptors, cytokines and chemokines, small-molecule inhibitors, and agents that reverse epigenetic dysregulation.

Education, self-management and exercise are important components of treatment. Muscle strengthening if weak and then aerobic exercises are the key to good management. Use of proper footwear, and weight reduction in overweight individuals, will reduce biomechanical loading of joints and improve symptoms. Use of aids such as a walking stick or devices to aid everyday activities (exempli gratia for opening jars) can also help symptoms and improve participation. The effects of many non-pharmacological therapies are difficult to discern because of differences in study designs and heterogeneous outcomes.

Pharmacotherapy should only be used as an adjunct to lifestyle modification. Pharmacotherapy is more effective for the maintenance than induction of weight loss but must be used on an ongoing basis to maintain the effect. Pharmacotherapy improves the cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity. Orlistat has been shown to be safe and effective, and to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, over a 4-year period. Bariatric surgery is among the most clinically effective and cost-effective procedures in medicine. The majority of cases of diabetes resolve after bariatric surgery. Adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are performed laparoscopically.

Pharmacotherapy is more effective for the maintenance than induction of weight loss but must be used on an ongoing basis to maintain the effect. Pharmacotherapy improves the cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity. Orlistat has been shown to be safe and effective, and to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, over a 4-year period. Bariatric surgery is among the most clinically effective and cost-effective procedures in medicine. The majority of cases of diabetes resolve after bariatric surgery. Adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are performed laparoscopically.

Patients may be started on a biosimilar or switched from an originator biologic. The decision to prescribe a biosimilar in place of a biologic is a clinical one, and has long been practiced with the epoetins and recombinant growth hormone. The demonstration of compatibility with the originator biological provides clinicians with the confidence to switch to a biosimilar. Switching does not require any dosage modification, although patients may need to be taught how to use a new injection device. The prescription should state the brand name and international non-proprietary name of the biologic or biosimilar, and in some countries the prescriber must indicate that substitution is not permitted. Substitution of a biologic with a biosimilar at pharmacy level is not permitted in the EU. The batch number must also be recorded. Clinicians' concerns that switching risks problems with immunogenicity are unfounded; indeed, numerous medicines agencies have concluded that biosimilars licensed in the EU are interchangeable and that switching would not be expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. Furthermore, microheterogeneity in the originator biologic means that a patient is exposed to slightly different molecules over the course of treatment.

Symptomatic collections can be divided into symptomatic sterile collections and infected collections. Bulky sterile collections may become symptomatic or clinically relevant because of pain and/or compression of adjacent structures. Infected pancreatic/peripancreatic necrosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Sterile symptomatic collections are mostly managed non-invasively. Drainage is indicated in infected collections or in symptomatic sterile collections that persist despite initial conservative treatment. Currently, initial endoscopic drainage (plus/or percutaneous drainage in collections distant from the digestive tract) followed if needed by endoscopic necrosectomy seems the treatment of choice to drain collections. Video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement is a good alternative to endoscopic necrosectomy. Open necrosectomy should be avoided if possible.

Extranodal lymphomas must be monitored during and after treatment to assess response to therapy. Staging is mandatory in the management of lymphoma. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a valuable staging investigation for patients with many subtypes of lymphoma. When staging investigations have been completed, the patient and relatives must be fully informed of the nature of the condition and the likely treatment plan, and given opportunities to ask questions. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of management. Neutropenic sepsis is a life-threatening complication of chemotherapy and requires urgent assessment. Fertility is an important consideration in any patient of childbearing age receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients who relapse should be considered for re-biopsy and complete restaging.

Five immunotherapies have recently been approved for the second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, and two have also been approved in the first-line setting. There is good evidence that second-line treatment after cisplatin-based chemotherapy is generally well tolerated, efficacious, and can confer a survival advantage. First-line treatment is also efficacious, particularly in patients less likely to tolerate cytotoxic chemotherapy. So far there is no strong evidence that immunotherapies targeted at the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis differ substantially in terms of efficacy or toxicity. A survival benefit has been shown with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy but not atezolizumab (likely a reflection of the study design); however, survival data from the trials of the other immunotherapies are not yet mature. Combination strategies are being explored; these may be more active than monotherapies but are likely to be more toxic and more costly. Current tissue-based programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) assays do not reliably predict response or lack of response to PD-1-targeted therapy. The management of advanced and metastatic bladder cancer will evolve as the results of further trials emerge.

Pain management during the acute first 4-week phase of low back pain should consist of RICE (rest, ice, corset/brace, exercise) unless 'red flags' are present. No X-ray or laboratory investigation is indicated unless 'red flags' are present. Treatment will depend on assessment of pain severity (severe, moderate, mild, minimal). Multidisciplinary treatment should be strongly considered in chronic pain management. Medications during the acute phase can include paracetamol (acetaminophen), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants. Short-term opioids for severe pain can also be considered. The visual analog scale (VAS) for measuring pain is very helpful. Bed rest is rarely indicated, but restful postures and ergonomic considerations to promote comfortable ambulatory activities should be encouraged. Graduated and progressive home reconditioning along with pain control measures is indicated. Spinal manipulation once or twice weekly for up to 4 weeks may be helpful for acute low back pain. Evidence for the benefits of manipulation for chronic low back pain is lacking. Acupuncture may be helpful. A trial of six to eight treatments should help determine acupuncture efficacy. Corsets are of equivocal benefit for acute pain management and should be limited in their use.

Novel therapeutic management approaches for patients with glioblastoma are needed, but the selective targeting of oncogenic mutations that has transformed the therapeutic landscape in other cancers has yet to be exploited in the treatment of glioblastoma. The need to penetrate the blood-brain barrier is a complicating factor. Ivosidenib, a small-molecule IDH inhibitor, vemurafenib, an inhibitor of BRAF V600E, and marizomib, a pan-proteosome inhibitor, are currently in early trials in patients with brain tumors. Dendritic cell immunotherapy is emerging as a promising addition to the multimodal treatment of glioblastoma. The final survival results of a large Phase III trial are awaited. The use of drug-induced interleukin-12 gene therapy is currently being evaluated in patients undergoing resection for recurrent high-grade glioma.

A carefully taken history is the best screening test for a coagulation disorder. If a bleeding tendency is suspected, the platelet function analyzer-100 test, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the prothrombin time (PT) may identify the cause. Thromboelastography may be useful in patients with massive bleeding. The management of surgical bleeding includes meticulous local hemostatic measures, as well as replacement of red cells, fibrinogen and platelets. Consider vitamin K therapy in every postoperative patient with a prolonged prothrombin time.

A thorough evaluation of pain history and a detailed examination are the foundations for a rational treatment plan. Persistent pain is a disease entity per se that can undermine many dimensions of health-related quality of life. The patient's pain history should document the onset, location, radiation, duration, type (character) and intensity of pain, exacerbating or alleviating factors, previous treatments and response to them, and the meaning of the pain to the patient and their family. Assessment of patients with chronic pain should include a physical examination with particular attention to neurological and musculoskeletal function, a psychosocial assessment and, when appropriate, diagnostic testing such as imaging. Particular attention must be paid to risks for addiction and/or overdose before prescribing, and during a course of, opioid analgesics.

Kidney stones are common and are most often associated with hypercalciuria. Stones can be asymptomatic or cause a variety of clinical problems. Stones may require surgical intervention, but recurrence after surgery is common. High fluid intake and a low-salt and low-oxalate diet are the mainstays of management. Low-calcium diets should be avoided. Thiazide diuretics and potassium citrate are used in some patients.

The incidence of new cases of schizophrenia is 1-2 per 10000 population per year. The condition exists in all countries and cultures, but incidence and prevalence rates vary markedly. Rates are higher in ethnic minority groups. Onset is usually in early adult life; 20% will recover completely. Urban environments in childhood appear unexpectedly important in causing schizophrenia. Life expectancy in people with schizophrenia is 15 years less than the general population, mainly because of increased cardiometabolic disease.

Acne (acne vulgaris) typically occurs around adolescence. Acne can present in the neonate, and may persist beyond adolescence in susceptible individuals. Patients with infantile acne may experience resurgence at puberty. Midfacial comedones in prepubertal acne correlate with relatively worse prognosis. There may be a link between geographic location and the prevalence of acne, with lower prevalence of acne in rural compared with urban populations.

MRI can suggest a diagnosis of a brain tumor, but surgery is always necessary to provide tissue for pathological diagnosis (except in the case of diffuse pontine glioma). Stereotactic biopsy is a safe procedure for obtaining diagnostic tissue, but sampling error may result in the tumor grade being underestimated. Image-guided surgery facilitates radical resection of intracranial tumors. Elderly patients with poor neurological function are at highest risk of morbidity and mortality following craniotomy for tumor resection. Following surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment for long-term control of most intracranial neoplasms. Radiotherapy is associated with considerable brain side effects, including late toxicities such as dementia and cerebral radionecrosis. Conformal radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy are emerging techniques designed to provide maximal radiation dose to the tumor while sparing normal surrounding tissues. Inherent or acquired drug resistance and the blood-brain barrier are important factors limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with brain tumors. The chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide has revolutionized the treatment of gliomas, and is now firmly established as a component of initial management for glioblastoma. Novel agents that target angiogenesis are the most promising of targeted therapies for malignant gliomas.

Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 provide specific criteria for the diagnosis of bulimia and anorexia. Structured interviews allow the reliable and valid assessment of the key behavioral features and associated psychopathology of eating disorders. Patients with eating disorders are likely to present with profound weight loss or weight fluctuations, malnutrition and a number of medical complications associated with recurrent vomiting, as well as social problems. Comorbid psychological problems include depression, anxiety and obsessive behavior, and substance misuse in patients with bulimia. Laboratory tests may help to identify the degree of electrolyte imbalance caused by frequent purging and to determine overall nutritional status and need for hospitalization.

Rheumatoid arthritis can be assessed using objective clinical scores such as swollen-joint counts, biochemical and radiological parameters such as acute-phase response and joint X-rays, and subjective measures of pain, function and participation. Most information is captured in composite scores such as the disease activity score (DAS). Quality of life is of overriding importance to the patient, and should always be considered during routine assessments. A number of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are being developed that quantify symptoms such as fatigue and sleep.

Spirometry is the most important measurement in COPD and is essential for diagnosis. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are recorded in absolute values (liters) and also as a percentage of the predicted values for the individual depending on age, height, sex and ethnic origin. An FEV over 80% of the predicted value is considered to be normal. This does not exclude the presence of disease. A post-bronchodilator FEV :FVC ratio below 0.7 indicates chronic airflow limitation and is a diagnostic criterion for COPD. A standardized technique must be employed in spirometry assessment. It is critical that the expiratory flow trace reaches a plateau to prove that the patient has reached the FVC. Reversibility testing to bronchodilators is useful in differential diagnosis to distinguish those with marked reversibility indicative of asthma. There is no standard assessment of reversibility; generally, however, an improvement in FEV of both 200 mL and 12% over the baseline is interpreted as a positive result. Peak expiratory flow rate is not the best assessment of airway obstruction in COPD and may underestimate the degree of airway obstruction. Further tests of lung volumes and the diffusing capacity in the lung for carbon monoxide may be helpful in some cases.

Clinical recognition of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) requires a careful assessment of the clinical presentation and history, application of appropriate imaging techniques and measurement of biomarkers. A patient's symptom description is a critical diagnostic step, and typical symptoms such as chest heaviness, oppression and retrosternal burning are important angina symptoms. A 12-lead ECG should be performed and reviewed by an experienced clinician in all patients with suspected ACS within 10 minutes of first medical contact (id est on first contact with emergency medical services either outside or in hospital). If the likelihood of ACS is high but the 12-lead ECG is normal, a 17-lead ECG may be performed to reveal 'true posterior' ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Early risk stratification is strongly recommended. Optimal risk stratification requires a multivariable approach. Clinical validated risk-stratification models such as the TIMI or GRACE risk scores are useful for assisting in management strategies and timing of invasive treatment in patients with suspected ACS. Invasive and non-invasive management strategies for ACS reduce the recurrence of ischemic events, but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Major bleeding and the need for transfusion are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality as well as a long-term risk of death or MI; gastrointestinal and femoral access site bleeding are the most frequent bleeding complications.

A patient's symptom description is a critical diagnostic step, and typical symptoms such as chest heaviness, oppression and retrosternal burning are important angina symptoms. A 12-lead ECG should be performed and reviewed by an experienced clinician in all patients with suspected ACS within 10 minutes of first medical contact (id est on first contact with emergency medical services either outside or in hospital). If the likelihood of ACS is high but the 12-lead ECG is normal, a 17-lead ECG may be performed to reveal 'true posterior' ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Early risk stratification is strongly recommended. Optimal risk stratification requires a multivariable approach. Clinical validated risk-stratification models such as the TIMI or GRACE risk scores are useful for assisting in management strategies and timing of invasive treatment in patients with suspected ACS. Invasive and non-invasive management strategies for ACS reduce the recurrence of ischemic events, but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

The hemolytic anemia associated with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency can range from mild to severe, with hemoglobin levels typically in the range of 6-12 g/dL. It can be exacerbated by hemolytic episodes and aplastic crises. Gallstones are a common complication of PK deficiency and the risk persists after splenectomy. Cholecystectomy should be considered at the time of splenectomy regardless of the presence of gallstones. Many patients with PK deficiency will have prenatal and neonatal complications including hyperbilirubinemia, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation and perinatal anemia. Transfusion-independent iron loading can occur at any age and with any severity of anemia. Annual monitoring of iron is indicated in all patients with PK deficiency, regardless of transfusion status. Chelation may be intermittently prescribed. Other complications of PK deficiency can include low bone density, extramedullary hematopoiesis, pulmonary hypertension and leg ulcers. In pregnant women with PK deficiency, recommendations for management include close fetal monitoring, consideration of transfusions (because hemolysis is exacerbated) and avoidance of iron-containing supplements.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is very common and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is vital to determine whether AF is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent or permanent because the treatment aims are different for each patient group. Stroke risk and major bleeding risk in AF are multifactorial and can be assessed by the CHADS /CHA DS -VASc and HAS-BLED scores, respectively. The direct oral anticoagulants are gradually replacing warfarin as first-line anticoagulant treatment for AF. Radiofrequency ablation is now the preferred option for many patients with AF. AF ablation is still evolving as an interventional procedure, with the arrival of new mapping software and the continual evaluation of ablation methods and techniques. In most patients, AF is not cured by ablation. In many patients, AF is a progressive condition that may be associated with long-term recurrences of AF after apparently successful ablation procedures.

The clinical presentation of MS depends on the location of inflammatory lesions in the CNS. Pathology in the optic nerve, spinal cord and brainstem can result in a broad range of signs and symptoms. However, the majority of deep white matter lesions in the hemispheres are clinically silent. People with MS do not always present with the first episode of demyelination. It is therefore important to determine whether the patient has experienced a prior neurological disturbance of any sort (exempli gratia mild or temporary visual blurring). Depending on MRI findings, MS can be diagnosed at the first presentation because of demyelination within the CNS; this is termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). To diagnose MS, lesions must be shown to be present, separated by space and time. The number of asymptomatic demyelinating lesions on MRI at the time of CIS strongly predicts the likelihood of the patient developing clinically definite MS. The pattern of MS - relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive or progressive relapsing - will guide prognosis and choice of disease-modifying therapy. These definitions are in flux; one study suggested the term 'active' to indicate ongoing inflammation on brain MRI independent of the clinical course. Rarer alternative causes of inflammatory demyelination within the CNS such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) should be considered and excluded in the diagnostic work-up of MS. Red flag features that suggest an alternative diagnosis include involvement of the peripheral nervous system, atypical MRI findings or systemic features of disease. MRI is the most important investigation in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS. MS progression can be measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and with MRI.

These definitions are in flux; one study suggested the term 'active' to indicate ongoing inflammation on brain MRI independent of the clinical course. Rarer alternative causes of inflammatory demyelination within the CNS such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) should be considered and excluded in the diagnostic work-up of MS. Red flag features that suggest an alternative diagnosis include involvement of the peripheral nervous system, atypical MRI findings or systemic features of disease. MRI is the most important investigation in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS. MS progression can be measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and with MRI.
The clinical presentation of MS depends on the location of inflammatory lesions in the CNS. Pathology in the optic nerve, spinal cord and brainstem can result in a broad range of signs and symptoms. However, the majority of deep white matter lesions in the hemispheres are clinically silent. People with MS do not always present with the first episode of demyelination. It is therefore important to determine whether the patient has experienced a prior neurological disturbance of any sort (exempli gratia mild or temporary visual blurring). Depending on MRI findings, MS can be diagnosed at the first presentation because of demyelination within the CNS; this is termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). To diagnose MS, lesions must be shown to be present, separated by space and time.

Diet for healthy weight and optimized glucose control is one of the cornerstones of diabetes self-care. Increased physical activity and reduced sedentariness are fundamental to physical health and healthy weight in diabetes control. Suitable management plans for people with diabetes will include addressing nutrition and physical activity, using the skill sets of allied health professionals including dietitians and exercise physiologists, where available. If these specialists are not available or easily accessible, others involved in patient care, including general practitioners, diabetes educators and endocrinologists are ideally placed to provide lifestyle advice to people with diabetes.

Patients should be referred for presurgical evaluation after failure of two or more regimens using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), particularly if they have a resectable lesion. Essential presurgical evaluation includes long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, MRI with a dedicated protocol, and neuropsychological assessment for language and memory functions. Most patients (70-80%) with mesial temporal sclerosis can become seizure free after anterior temporal lobectomy. Vagus nerve stimulation is a therapeutic option for patients with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures, particularly those with non-resectable seizure foci. The ketogenic diet is effective adjunctive therapy for children with drug-resistant epilepsy. The ketogenic diet should only be used under expert medical and nutritional supervision. Up to one-third of patients with epilepsy take herbal or dietary supplements for general maintenance of health or the control of symptoms such as difficulty sleeping or depression. Thus, knowledge of the products taken by the patient may provide the clinician with information on AED side effects or comorbid mood disorders. Clinicians must take a thorough history from patients regarding the use of alternative medicines, and check reliable databases for information on safety as well as possible effects on seizure frequency and serum AED concentrations.

All patients with adenocarcinoma should have mutation testing for EGFR and ALK-MET at diagnosis. EGFR mutations at any stage should have treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor until symptomatic progression. Patients with ALK-MET or ROS1 translocations respond well to crizotinib. Second-generation drugs are becoming available. Other driver mutations and targeted therapies need acceleration into the clinic for patient benefit.

The immune response to the presence of cancer cells is a cyclical process that is potentially self-propagating. However, the existence of numerous negative regulators allows tumor cells to evade the immune system. Tumor immunoediting has three components, known as the 'three Es': elimination, equilibrium and evasion:- during the initial elimination phase, some cancer cells are recognized as altered by the immune system and are destroyed- during the equilibrium phase, some cancer cells persist, but the immune response is sufficient to prevent proliferation- eventually, however, selective pressure leads to a predominance of cells that are able to avoid the immune response - escape. The immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and CTLA-4 are key factors in the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. However, there are multiple other potential targets, some of which have inhibitory activity and others agonistic activity in T-cell activation. Solid tumors consist of multiple cell types that together contribute to the development of a microenvironment that favors tumor growth and evasion of the immune system.

Patients with arrhythmias can present in a variety of ways. Occasionally, it may be important for the patient to distinguish increased awareness of heart beat from true cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with palpitations and known structural cardiac disease should be evaluated without delay.

Psoriasis is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy. Before beginning therapy, the patient should have a realistic expectation of the outcome. All systemic medications used for psoriasis can have limiting side effects and toxicities. Patient assessment should include reference to important comorbidities. Rotational, combination and sequential therapeutic strategies can reduce side effects and increase efficacy, while maintaining longer-term control of the psoriasis and reducing the frequency and severity of inevitable relapses.

'Red flags' are a set of findings that suggest that back pain is non-mechanical and may be due to fracture, malignancy, infection or systemic inflammatory disease The visual analog scale (VAS) is a simple linear scale to measure pain intensity and response to therapy. The pain drawing provides a simple way for the patient to indicate the region of the pain and often suggest etiology. A classic example involves groin tenderness as a marker of probable hip joint disease rather than a back-referred disorder. Ergonomic factors should be assessed, and this can often be readily done by observing the patient's movement in the clinic and during examination. Palpation of key painful areas of the spine, facet joint areas, iliac crests, buttocks (sciatic outlet - piriformis region) and trochanteric bursae will often indicate the nature of the pain and/or significant areas of referred pain that may respond to different forms of therapy. The patient's gait and body motion can be observed in the clinic to detect sciatic scoliosis; short leg; hip, knee or foot arthritis or weakness; and/or foot drop as markers of relevant pathology.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Age is the main risk factor for AML, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); the prevalence of these leukemias increases with age. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) most commonly affects younger people; over 50% of patients with ALL are under 20 years of age. The main risk factor for AML, CML and CLL is age, with recurrent genetic mutations accumulating over time. Predisposing conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis increase the risk of AML and CLL, respectively. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is present in up to 10% of the population aged over 65. Although this increases the risk of hematologic malignancies, most individuals with CHIP do not develop a hematologic disorder. Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of AML and ALL. The risk is greatest in early childhood, when transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) develops. However, TAM spontaneously remits in most cases; only about 10% of cases, with additional genetic mutations, go on to develop AML. Although most cases of AML are sporadic, arising from the steady accumulation of genetic mutations with age, some individuals have a germline inherited genetic predisposition to the disease. Environmental exposures to chemicals such as benzene, high-dose ionizing radiation and previous chemotherapy increase the risk of leukemia to varying degrees.

Smoking causes substantial mortality and morbidity, killing an estimated 6 million people worldwide each year. The main causes of death from smoking are lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking also increases the risk of a wide range of disabling conditions, such as age-related blindness, deafness and dementia. Smoking impairs fertility and increases the risk of fetal and neonatal death. Stopping smoking reduces the risks; a healthy smoker who stops before 35 years of age has a near-normal life expectancy. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and acts, among other things, as a central nervous system stimulant. Nicotine at the level associated with smoking has relatively few adverse health effects and does not cause cancer. Smoking cessation causes temporary withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability, restlessness, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating and increased appetite. Many smokers experience permanent weight gain when they stop smoking.

The nervous system is dynamic and plastic; noxious stimuli trigger biological processes that lead to amplification or inhibition of the noxious signal. Nociceptive input activates descending pathways that inhibit spinal noxious transmission. These descending pathways are potential targets for analgesic drugs. Neuropathic pain is produced by a lesion of the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). Nerve injury produces hyperexcitability and spontaneous generation of ectopic impulses in axons and neurons. Ectopic peripheral nerve activity contributes to the central hyperexcitable state and enlargement of neuronal receptive fields. After nerve injury there may be a loss of spinal inhibition control resulting from loss of neuronal inhibitory processes and persistence of glia-induced neuronal hypersensitivity. The connectivity of sympathic fibers to injured neurons contributes to the activation of pain by stress. All three of these maladaptions may play a major role in chronic neuropathic pain. Increased understanding of chronic pain pathophysiology is leading to new pharmacological targets for treatment. Increased understanding of the causal pathway from acute to chronic pain (chronification), provides targets for early preventive interventions following onset of pain-causing injury or disease. New imaging (especially of the brain) is increasing knowledge of pathophysiological CNS neuroplasticity changes and showing the effects of biobehavioral training to reverse these changes.

Increased understanding of the causal pathway from acute to chronic pain (chronification), provides targets for early preventive interventions following onset of pain-causing injury or disease. New imaging (especially of the brain) is increasing knowledge of pathophysiological CNS neuroplasticity changes and showing the effects of biobehavioral training to reverse these changes.
The nervous system is dynamic and plastic; noxious stimuli trigger biological processes that lead to amplification or inhibition of the noxious signal. Nociceptive input activates descending pathways that inhibit spinal noxious transmission. These descending pathways are potential targets for analgesic drugs. Neuropathic pain is produced by a lesion of the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). Nerve injury produces hyperexcitability and spontaneous generation of ectopic impulses in axons and neurons. Ectopic peripheral nerve activity contributes to the central hyperexcitable state and enlargement of neuronal receptive fields. After nerve injury there may be a loss of spinal inhibition control resulting from loss of neuronal inhibitory processes and persistence of glia-induced neuronal hypersensitivity.

Increasing evidence suggests that serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) in the fallopian tube are the most common precursor lesions of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common type of epithelial ovarian cancer. Intraperitoneal dissemination is the most characteristic feature of ovarian cancer. Borderline ovarian tumors constitute a separate tumor entity and can present with the same histological subgroups as the invasive form of the disease.
Supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) refer to a reciprocating regular tachycardia involving the atrioventricular (AV) node region, an accessory pathway or a discrete atrial substrate. SVTs usually occur in young, otherwise healthy, adults, but may be seen at any age. Intervention is not usually needed if symptoms are infrequent and non-intrusive, providing a diagnosis of SVT has been confirmed. Where ventricular pre-excitation is present on electrocardiography (exempli gratia patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome), referral for cardiological assessment and risk profiling is strongly recommended. Regular antiarrhythmic therapy is not advised in asymptomatic WPW. In symptomatic patients with WPW syndrome, even if symptoms are minimal, ablation is recommended. Pharmacological treatment is aimed at slowing conduction through the AV node and/or the accessory pathway. First-line treatment is catheter ablation; in the presence of normal ventricular function, antiarrhythmic agents are also considered (flecainide, propafenone or sotalol).

Voiding problems occur when normal smooth emptying of the bladder is impeded, through obstruction or impaired detrusor contractility. Benign prostatic enlargement secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a process of normal aging in men, is the most common cause of outlet obstruction. In women, pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can cause obstruction. Rarer causes include posterior urethral valves, urethral stricture and bladder neck obstruction, which may be congenital or secondary to increased voiding pressures as a result of urethral abnormality. Uroflowmetry and urodynamic investigations are useful in the diagnosis of outlet obstruction but are not indicated for all men thought to have BPH. Transurethral ultrasonography and measurement of postvoid residual volume may also provide useful information. Videourodynamic investigations can be helpful in women with POP and suspected obstruction. Obstruction due to BPH can be treated with alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. Surgery (transurethral resection, vaporization or incision of the prostate) may be needed. Surgery is often required for bladder neck obstruction and urethral stricture.

The majority (> 80%) of women with epithelial ovarian cancer will become apparent and diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease. There are no reliable imaging tools to accurately describe the stage of the disease or tumor dissemination patterns, especially in fine nodular peritoneal carcinomatosis and microscopically involved lymph nodes. Comprehensive surgical staging accurately defines the disease stage, resulting in more reliable prediction of prognosis and more appropriate management strategies and systemic treatment.

Every trial has the potential to yield a false-positive or a false-negative result - the false positive is known as the type I error and the false negative the type II error. Potential for the false positive is controlled at 5%, the significance level, while the false negative is controlled via the power. Power is equal to 100% − type II error. The type II error is the false negative, missing a real difference, while the power is the true positive, capturing a real difference. Power can be calculated at the planning stage, in advance of running the trial, by making various assumptions about, in particular, the magnitude of the treatment effect. The sample size calculation is based on the requirement to detect a prespecified treatment difference, often referred to as the clinically relevant difference, with a certain level of power, usually 80%, or at least 90% in a Phase III pivotal trial. As many oncology studies are powered on a primary time-to-event endpoint - power being determined by the number of patients with events - many oncology studies are event driven, with the statistical analysis taking place once the required number of patients with events have been reported. It is possible to increase the sample size if the event rate is lower than anticipated - if this is done in a blinded way, there is no statistical penalty or implication for the statistical method to be used for analysis.

Whatever the reason for a patient's presentation, the presence of obesity should be acknowledged and tackled. The initial approach is crucial: an individual can be permanently engaged or alienated depending on the opening gambit. The best initial screening method is to look at the patient: an obese abdomen is a simple physical sign to pick up but can be indicative of potentially serious underlying disease. Waist circumference is directly proportional to the amount of visceral fat. It has gained recognition as a more accurate indicator of cardiometabolic risk than body mass index and is being increasingly embraced in routine medical practice. Decreased waist circumference in the absence of weight loss can keep a patient motivated.

Counseling can be helpful for all people with multiple sclerosis (MS): it will involve explaining the nature of the disease, the risks and benefits of therapy and the effect MS will have on all aspects of life, including career, family, travel and insurance. Common concerns raised by patients include life expectancy, heritability of the disease, long-term planning and effect of pregnancy. Healthcare teams need to stress the importance of overall health and wellness in MS given the known consequences of comorbidities in patients. A multidisciplinary team is important for the coordination of patient care, and comprises neurologists, primary care providers, specialist nurses, physician assistants, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, social workers, psychologists and continence nurses. Advanced practice clinicians (APCs) are a reliable source of information about all aspects of the condition. They have an important role in helping patients recognize the signs and symptoms of relapse, providing practical advice on living with MS and providing a link with other services. Concerns about employment can become a great source of stress. Employers have an obligation to aid people with MS as much as possible to remain in employment. Functional capacity evaluation and neuropsychological testing can help determine a person's employability.

Psychosis is generally due to an interaction between PD medications and PD pathology. Although dopamine stimulation may cause Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), anticholinergics and amantadine cause identical symptoms. The importance of 5HT2A serotonin receptor stimulation is supported by the usefulness of pimavanserin as an antipsychotic drug. Visual hallucinations in PDP have been linked to alterations in visual circuitry in the brain in both functional MRI and MRI connectivity studies, as well as to alterations in both dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter circuits. Cholinergic mechanisms may be more important in both hallucinations and delusions arising in people with dementia with Lewy bodies. Psychotic symptoms are not simply related to drug levels in the brain; they also reflect the state of alertness.

Most cases of Parkinson's disease are recognizable at an early stage, but can be misdiagnosed if tremor is absent. Characteristic motor symptoms include tremor, bradykinesia, a hurried shuffling gait, freezing episodes, rigidity and a bent posture. Non-motor symptoms include depression, dementia, sleep disorders, bowel and bladder problems, fatigue, apathy and pain; although common, these symptoms are often overlooked. There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, but DaTSCAN with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is becoming widely available, and can help to support a clinical diagnosis. Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease show a significant and sustained response to dopaminergic agents. Brain imaging is not typically used to diagnose Parkinson's disease, but may help to rule out tumors, vascular disease and normal-pressure hydrocephalus; transcranial ultrasound scanning reveals characteristic hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra. All patients with a 'suspected' diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be referred untreated to a specialist who can reliably differentiate between Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes. A shared care strategy can then be implemented, with ongoing care by the primary care team.

No features on plain chest radiography are specific for COPD. The features usually described are those of severe emphysema, but no abnormality may be visible, even in patients with marked disability. CT scans can be used to quantify emphysema, either by visual assessment of high-resolution scanning or by CT lung density measurements. CT scanning is the best way to detect and assess bullous disease. CT scanning is the standard way to assess patients for volume reduction surgery. Echocardiography, particularly continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography, can be used to assess pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with COPD.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and acidosis. Infection is the most common precipitating factor in DKA. Treatment of DKA is by fluid and electrolyte replacement, intravenous insulin and treatment of the underlying cause, when known. The overall mortality of DKA is 3-4%. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) occurs in older patients with type 2 diabetes. HHS is similar to DKA, but without ketosis and acidosis. Treatment of HHS is similar to the treatment of DKA.

Visceral pain results from activation of sensory afferent nerves that innervate the stomach, kidney, gallbladder, urinary bladder, intestines, pancreas and other visceral organs. Sensations arising from visceral stimulation are generally more diffuse, more difficult to localize and more unpleasant than those associated with somatic pain. Visceral pain is more likely than somatic pain to be associated with autonomic signs such as pallor and sweating, or symptoms such as nausea. Pain syndromes such as male chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis, endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome are thought to be maintained by the persistent activation of visceral fibers, and central sensitization. Management includes identifying and avoiding factors that aggravate the underlying condition and individual clinical trials of medication. Neuromodulatory techniques have been reported as helpful in selected cases.

Surgery is recommended when optimal drug treatment options have failed to control symptoms. Neurosurgery is an unpleasant experience for the patient; the main complications are stroke and infection. For patients with young-onset Parkinson's disease who have had 'on/off' symptoms for many years, the procedure of choice is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus to reduce dopaminergic therapy and control dyskinesias. Lesional surgery is an alternative to deep brain stimulation for patients unlikely to attend regular follow-up or who have to travel long distances, or in instances where the cost of a stimulator is prohibitive. Pallidotomy is appropriate for severe dyskinesia. Thalamic deep brain surgery (VIM nucleus) is the most effective procedure for controlling parkinsonian tremor. In the future, nerve-cell transplantation could replace dopaminergic treatment if sources of dopamine cells other than 6-10-week-old fetuses can be found; trials using porcine fetal cells, stem cells that generate dopamine and other such cells (exempli gratia retinal cells) are under way.

For patients with young-onset Parkinson's disease who have had 'on/off' symptoms for many years, the procedure of choice is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus to reduce dopaminergic therapy and control dyskinesias. Lesional surgery is an alternative to deep brain stimulation for patients unlikely to attend regular follow-up or who have to travel long distances, or in instances where the cost of a stimulator is prohibitive. Pallidotomy is appropriate for severe dyskinesia. Thalamic deep brain surgery (VIM nucleus) is the most effective procedure for controlling parkinsonian tremor.

All patients with von Willebrand disease should be characterized by laboratory investigation as fully as possible. Desmopressin is safe and effective therapy for many patients. When a clotting factor concentrate is indicated, it should contain high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor.

A seizure is a symptom of brain dysfunction. Depending on the pattern of onset, seizures are broadly classified into partial (focal) and generalized types; classification is important for identifying the underlying cause, prognosis and best approach to management. Epileptic syndromes are defined by clinical features, aided by appropriate investigations that include EEG and brain imaging. Benign rolandic epilepsy occurs in otherwise neurologically normal children and generally has an excellent response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Long-term AED treatment for children with simple febrile seizures is not recommended. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is often drug resistant but may be successfully treated by temporal lobectomy. Genetic mutations affecting ion channels have been identified in a range of rare idiopathic epilepsy syndromes.

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by the refusal to maintain a normal bodyweight by self-starvation. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by significant binge-eating and subsequent purging to control bodyweight. Eating disorders often remain secret; sufferers experience shame and isolation, which can hinder recovery. Other eating disorders include binge-eating disorder and night-eating syndrome.
The treatment of localized prostate cancer is controversial. Active surveillance is increasingly used for very-low- and low-risk disease. Only about one-third of men managed with active surveillance will go on to require curative treatment. Radical prostatectomy probably offers the best prospect of long-term cure but carries the disadvantages of possible sexual dysfunction and incontinence. In the case of high-risk cancer, surgery may be considered as part of a multimodal therapeutic approach. External-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) can be curative but may be associated with rectal or bladder complications. Brachytherapy can be combined with EBRT in higher-risk individuals. Treatment with EBRT and hormonal therapy is more effective than radiotherapy alone in men with intermediate- and high-risk cancer. In a large international trial, the antiandrogen bicalutamide, 150 mg/day, reduced objective progression by 31% but gynecomastia was common.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment is not indicated for bladder cancer that is T2 or higher. Surgical resection (radical or partial cystectomy) is the mainstay of treatment for patients suitable for surgery. Adequate node dissection should be performed at the time of cystectomy. For patients being managed with curative intent, chemoradiotherapy should be considered as an alternative to surgery, with appropriate multidisciplinary input. Cytotoxic drugs are used in the context of chemoradiotherapy with the intention of improving local disease control rather than achieving distant control. Toxicity is greater with combined chemotherapy and radiation than with radiation therapy alone. Patients treated with palliative intent are probably best offered radiation therapy only if surgery is not appropriate.

Breakthrough CINV within 5 days of chemotherapy administration remains a significant clinical problem despite the development of effective agents for the prevention of CINV. Olanzapine has been shown in a phase III clinical trial to be an effective treatment. A change in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen should be considered for those patients who develop refractory CINV. If the patient has a poor experience with CINV in the first cycle, anticipatory CINV may develop requiring behavioral therapy. Optimum control of CINV during the first course of chemotherapy may prevent breakthrough, refractory and anticipatory CINV. Each patient should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen based on the specific type of chemotherapy and their individual risk factors before the first course of chemotherapy.

The type of statistical method used to analyze trial data depends on the type of endpoint being measured. Common endpoint types are continuous, score, binary, ordered categorical, count and time to event. Summary statistics provide a simple descriptive value for a data sample, which enables comparison of data sets. The mean (arithmetic average) is the most common measure used for continuous and score data with a normal or symmetric distribution. The median is the preferred measure for data with a skewed distribution. Proportions are compared for binary and ordered categorical endpoints. The standard deviation is a measure of patient-to-patient variability. The standard error is a measure of the extent of sampling variation. A 95% confidence interval is a range of values within which the true population value lies 95% of the time. The null hypothesis usually states that treatment effects are equal. The alternative hypothesis is that they are not equal. These hypotheses give two-sided p -values. One-sided p -values can be obtained when looking for differences only in one direction. The p -value is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates whether to accept the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis. For two-sided testing, a p -value <= 0.05 shows that there is statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis, id est there is a statistically significant difference between the treatments. The odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) are used to express the difference between binary endpoints. OR > 1 or RR > 1 indicates that the odds or risk of an event occurring, respectively, are higher in the treatment group. The two-sample t -test is used to analyze data with a normal or approximately normal distribution. Skewed data sets can be transformed (exempli gratia by log) before analysis with the t -test, or analyzed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U -test.

In the acute setting the investigation of polyarthritis is guided primarily by the differential diagnosis. There are no pathognomonic tests for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and investigations may be completely normal at presentation. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are highly specific for RA and have a sensitivity of up to 75%. Conventional X-rays may provide diagnostic information but are less sensitive than MRI and high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS), although MRI and HRUS continue to be validated. In the chronic setting, investigations are useful for determining disease activity, monitoring therapy and documenting and monitoring joint damage.

Induction therapy for most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises intensive anthracycline/cytarabine (Ara-C) combination chemotherapy aimed at achieving a complete response (CR). However, almost all patients who achieve a CR after induction therapy will ultimately relapse without post-remission therapy. Post-remission therapy for AML, comprising one or more courses of chemotherapy, or autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), is given to eliminate any residual disease and achieve a cure. The ideal donor for HSCT is a sibling with complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. Unrelated donors who are a good match or related donors with some matching may also be suitable, but the risk of graft-versus-host disease is increased. Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprises chemotherapeutic induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy with central nervous system prophylaxis. Treatment options for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) include disease control with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or palliative therapy with cytotoxic agents and, less commonly, HSCT. TKIs are the initial treatment of choice for almost all patients with newly diagnosed CML. Treatment decisions for patients with CML depend on the phase of the disease, response to TKI treatment, age and eligibility for HSCT. The standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is observation rather than immediate treatment. Treatment is indicated for patients with more advanced or symptomatic disease to ameliorate symptoms and improve survival.

However, almost all patients who achieve a CR after induction therapy will ultimately relapse without post-remission therapy. Post-remission therapy for AML, comprising one or more courses of chemotherapy, or autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), is given to eliminate any residual disease and achieve a cure. The ideal donor for HSCT is a sibling with complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. Unrelated donors who are a good match or related donors with some matching may also be suitable, but the risk of graft-versus-host disease is increased. Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprises chemotherapeutic induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy with central nervous system prophylaxis. Treatment options for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) include disease control with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or palliative therapy with cytotoxic agents and, less commonly, HSCT. TKIs are the initial treatment of choice for almost all patients with newly diagnosed CML. Treatment decisions for patients with CML depend on the phase of the disease, response to TKI treatment, age and eligibility for HSCT. The standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is observation rather than immediate treatment. Treatment is indicated for patients with more advanced or symptomatic disease to ameliorate symptoms and improve survival.

With all cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), histopathology and clinical correlation is crucial in reaching the diagnosis. Malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) are derived from skin-homing resident effector memory T cells, while in Sézary syndrome (SS), the malignant cells are derived from central memory T cells. Both MF and SS usually display a CD3+, CD4+, CD7-, CD8- immunophenotype; however, CD8+ predominant cases of MF do exist. Histopathology of MF is characterized by small- to medium-sized T lymphocytes with epidermotropic cerebriform/pleomorphic nuclei, Pautrier's microabscesses, haloed lymphocytes along the dermal-epidermal junction and papillary dermal fibrosis. Tumor-stage MF has a more dense, diffuse and nodular infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes and can lack epidermotropism. Large cell transformation can occur in plaque- and tumor-stage disease. These cells are more than 4 times the size of a normal lymphocyte and must account for more than 25% of the atypical infiltrate. They can be either CD30+ or CD30-, with the latter leading to a poorer prognosis. Patients with early patch-stage MF generally do not need full systemic work-up; however, patients with plaque- and tumor-stage MF and SS need complete systemic work-up performed for staging. T-cell receptor polymerase chain reacton (TCR PCR) is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of MF, SS and other CTCLs. It is not 100% specific; however, in the correct clinical and histopathological setting it can be useful in determining monoclonality of the malignant lymphocytes. Matching clones identified from different samples are more useful in the diagnosis.

Precision medicine has become a key strategy in ovarian cancer. There is great hope that targeted therapies will offer improved outcomes. Targeted therapy generally involves identifying a gene or protein that is overexpressed in cancer and can be reasonably targeted with acceptable toxicity. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors - olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib - appear to be comparable in efficacy, but have differing toxicity profiles. Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is the most successful targeted therapy strategy in ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab has shown activity as a single agent in recurrent ovarian cancer in both platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease. A number of immuno-oncologic therapies, including inhibitors of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), have shown efficacy in various solid tumors and are under active development in ovarian cancer.

Central pain results from lesions in the brain and brainstem or spinal cord. The most common causes are stroke and traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), though there are many other causes. More than 8% of patients who have had a stroke develop central pain. This is probably an underestimate because communication problems may impede diagnosis of pain. Onset of post-stroke pain may occur up to several years after the injury. Within 2 weeks of SCI, 12% of patients have below-level neuropathic pain which is 'central'; by 6 months, 20% have central pain. Mean onset time is 1.8 +- 1.7 years (wide variation). The pathophysiology of central post-stroke pain (CPSP) involves a key role for lesions in diverse areas of the brain, including several different thalamic nuclei. One such lesion results in disinhibition of a nociceptive pathway that projects to the anterior cingulate cortex (limbic system) - this pathophysiology is associated with the burning quality of CPSP. The pathophysiology of SCI pain involves a 'spinal generator' and a 'supraspinal generator/amplifier'. Treatment of central pain is extremely challenging and requires a multimodal approach based on a biopsychosocial model. Differential diagnosis of pain type is crucial. New innovative physical/psychological treatments show promise of addressing maladaptive brain neuroplasticity changes. Pharmacotherapy, based on only a small number of controlled studies, have demonstrated efficacy of amitriptyline for CPSP (although not yet studied, a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs] may be preferable because of their lower toxicity) and pregabalin in both SCI and CPSP. Short-term efficacy has been reported for systemic (intravenous infusion) lidocaine (lignocaine), propofol and ketamine, but there is no evidence of long-term efficacy. Dorsal root entry zone lesioning can provide long-term relief of central pain after brachial plexus avulsion.

Acne and scarring can cause significant psychosocial disability. Psychological changes should be noted, assessed and taken into account when managing acne. Perception studies have identified that people with acne and/or scarring are perceived more negatively. Validated and recognized questionnaires are available to assess the psychological disability caused by acne. A small number of patients with body dysmorphic disorder have acne as their prime dysmorphic symptom. The acne in these patients is usually mild or non-existent and the patient's complaint does not correlate with the physical signs. Acne excoriée may be alleviated by psychotropic drug treatments, psychological therapy, hypnosis or habit reversal therapy. Acne may be associated with anorexia nervosa.

'Evergreening' is a process by which manufacturers of originator products introduce minor changes to protect their drug development data from being made available to other companies. US state laws govern drug substitutions by the pharmacist. In Europe, national patent laws may mean that one biosimilar, approved by the European Medicines Agency, is available with different names in different European countries - these are bioidenticals.
Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively common form of lymphoma that predominantly affects young people and is curable. There are two main types with distinct immunophenotypes and clinical pictures: classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (nLPHL). Diagnosis is by biopsy and identification of Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in cHL, or lymphocytic and histiocytic cells (LandH) in nLPHL. HRS cells are typically CD15+ and CD30+; LandH cells have a characteristic B-cell phenotype. Treatment of early-stage cHL involves two to four courses of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD), often with involved-field radiotherapy. Treatment of late-stage cHL involves six to eight courses of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD). The cure rate is 90-95% for early-stage disease and 75-80% for late-stage disease. Because of the high cure rates, a major aim of future treatment strategies is to reduce the long-term effects of treatment, such as secondary cancers and heart disease.

Fibrinogen deficiency Congenital hypofibrinogenemia predisposes to venous thromboembolism, postoperative and postpartum hemorrhage and placental abruption. As fibrinogen has a long half-life of 5 days, effective prophylaxis can be readily achieved for surgery and throughout pregnancy. Factor VII deficiency Bleeding is uncommon in factor (F)VII heterozygotes. Individuals with severe FVII deficiency are usually homozygous and originate from consanguineous marriages. Bleeding is common in patients with severe FVII deficiency; it can be severe, and can include intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment with recombinant human FVIIa is effective and should be given prophylactically. FXI deficiency Family members should be fully investigated for both FXI clotting activity and the mutation(s) in the gene, because compound heterozygotes are common. Unlike hemophilia A, the level of FXI is not a good predictor of bleeding risk. FXI concentrates should be used with caution, because they predispose to arterial and venous thromboembolism. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective therapy, but exposure to normal FXI in plasma or concentrates carries a risk of inhibitor development in those with type 2 disease.

Low-grade B-cell lymphomas are more common in the elderly and treatment is usually aimed at alleviating symptoms rather than curing the disease. Some low-grade lymphomas, such as follicular and mantle cell lymphomas, have characteristic immunophenotypes and cytogenetics that enable clear diagnosis. Other low-grade lymphomas are hard to diagnose definitively because of the lack of specific markers (exempli gratia marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma). Knowledge of the cause of the lymphoma has in some cases led to improved treatments (exempli gratia Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma).

Other low-grade lymphomas are hard to diagnose definitively because of the lack of specific markers (exempli gratia marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma). Knowledge of the cause of the lymphoma has in some cases led to improved treatments (exempli gratia Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma).

The correct diagnosis of the etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is important to prevent recurrence. Endoscopic ultrasonography is very useful in patients with an obscure etiology after anamnesis, laboratory findings and conventional ultrasonography. Diabetes, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, recurrence and progression to chronic pancreatitis are frequent consequences of AP.

Neuropathic bladder dysfunction can be classified according to the site of the lesion as suprapontine, suprasacral spinal or peripheral. Suprapontine lesions are largely associated with Parkinson's disease, dementia and cerebrovascular accident. They usually lead to detrusor overactivity but coordinated sphincter function is preserved. Suprasacral spinal lesions are associated with spinal cord injury, spina bifida and tumors, and interfere with the reflex control of the bladder from higher centers, resulting in detrusor overactivity and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Increased intravesical pressure can damage the ureters and, ultimately, the kidneys. Peripheral lesions affecting the nerve roots cause bladder areflexia or acontractility, such that the bladder fails to empty without straining. Sphincteric weakness may also contribute to incontinence. Management of detrusor overactivity aims to enable low-pressure storage of urine and bladder emptying without obstruction, achieved by antimuscarinic drugs, injection of botulinum toxin or surgery. Some patients require catheterization to ensure bladder emptying. Options are intermittent self-catheterization, if the bladder can store urine adequately without leaking (often achieved with antimuscarinic drugs), or a urethral or suprapubic indwelling catheter.

Risk-adapted treatment is based on accurate determination of stage, grade, number of tumors and presence of carcinoma in situ, and stratified as primary versus recurrent disease. Tumors can be classified into low-, intermediate- and high-risk based on these factors; these risk strata drive treatment decisions and surveillance recommendations. Low-risk tumors may recur but are unlikely to progress. Peri-operative single-dose chemotherapy reduces recurrence, and patients may only need cystoscopic follow-up. Intermediate-risk tumors are more likely to recur and have a modest progression risk. A course of intravesical chemotherapy will reduce the risk of recurrence but not of progression. Optimized mitomycin treatment is associated with optimal outcomes. Induction with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) followed by maintenance for 1 year is also a standard of care. High-risk bladder cancer is likely to recur and, unless adequately treated, to progress. It is fatal in up to 30% of patients. Intravesical BCG induction plus maintenance for 3 years is standard of care. Radical cystectomy is indicated for patients with high-risk disease that is unresponsive to BCG, if the patient is medically fit and accepts the risks.

The thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are a group of disorders that share common clinical characteristics and findings, but with differing pathobiologies that lead to the TMA presentation. Individuals with hemolytic uremic syndrome and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome typically present with more severe renal injury or renal failure compared with individuals with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Quinine, ciclosporin and tacrolimus can induce TMAs via an immune-mediated mechanism (quinine) or dose-dependent toxicity. Systemic disorders that can secondarily present with TMA findings include disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis/infection and autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus). Diseases that present with significant thrombocytopenia mimicking a systemic TMA that should be considered in the differential diagnosis include myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

In pregnancy, it is important to be aware of the complications that may be associated with severe coagulation disturbance (exempli gratia pregnancy-associated hypertension) and to monitor the blood count and coagulation screen in these patients. Before attributing a platelet count of 100 x 10 /L or less to the benign condition of gestational thrombocytopenia of pregnancy, other causes of a reduced platelet count should be excluded. In primary immune thrombocytopenia, the platelet count tends to fall as pregnancy progresses and treatment may be necessary to maintain it above about 50 x 10 /L. After delivery, the platelet count in the neonate should be monitored for about a week as it can fall profoundly in the first few days of life.

For most people and clinicians, osteoarthritis (OA) refers to a clinical syndrome of joint pain, functional impairment and impaired quality of life. Although radiographic OA is common, it is not always symptomatic. Joint pain is common, increasingly so with age; individuals frequently have multiple joint pains. People with OA are more likely to have comorbid conditions than the general population and comorbidities can exacerbate the impact of OA on an individual. OA has a large impact on the individual and society.

The prognosis for patients with malignant gliomas is influenced most by histology, tumor grade and age. Increasingly, genetic aberrations are being identified at the molecular level in a variety of gliomas, and these abnormalities will assume substantial prognostic and therapeutic importance as greater knowledge of their significance is acquired. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive of all gliomas. Surgery is the principal initial treatment for gliomas. The benefit of extensive surgery versus limited resection or biopsy is controversial. Postoperative radiotherapy delays tumor progression and prolongs life for patients with malignant glioma. Concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy with radiotherapy for glioblastoma is now the standard treatment for most patients with glioblastoma following surgery. This treatment is associated with significant long-term survival in responding patients. Patients who have tumors with hypermethylated O-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promotor regions appear to benefit most from this treatment strategy. The role of this regimen is unclear in elderly patients or patients with poor performance status with glioblastoma. The use of this regimen in anaplastic gliomas is being investigated. Chemotherapy is often administered for tumor recurrence or progression but is palliative and of limited benefit for most patients. More effective drugs are needed for this indication. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a chemosensitive tumor. The appropriate timing of chemotherapy is controversial. Anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors that harbor co-deletion of 1p and 19q have a more favorable prognosis, and respond more consistently and durably to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Observation may be an appropriate initial strategy for patients with low-grade gliomas. The timing and extent of surgery for low-grade glioma is controversial. Increasingly, radiotherapy is deferred until clinically necessary, and lower doses are usually administered. The role of initial chemotherapy for low-grade gliomas is unclear, but is an option for a subset of patients with this diagnosis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a worrisome complication of advanced liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma often has few specific symptoms or signs. Hepatocellular carcinoma should be suspected in patients with an unexpected worsening of liver disease. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is of unclear utility, but is widely practiced. Regular checking of serum alpha fetoprotein levels and hepatic ultrasound scanning are acceptable. Curative treatment by resection or transplantation is an option, but not always possible. Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, transarterial chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are all treatment options.

Eating disorders not otherwise specified is the category of diagnosis given to cases that do not fulfill all DSM-IV criteria for anorexia or bulimia; subtypes of this category include binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES). There is a higher prevalence of BED than anorexia or bulimia in men. The peak age of onset for BED is somewhat later than that for bulimia, and BED has an overall better prognosis. Individuals with NES wake several times throughout the night to eat, consuming over one-third of their total energy intake after their evening meal. Feeding disorders in young children are categorized as feeding disorder of infancy and childhood, rumination disorder or pica.

Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in patients with glioblastoma. If the patient is fit enough, then light-to-moderate exercise or physical therapy should be encouraged. Short-term steroids may be useful, provided patients are warned of the potential short-term adverse effects. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are suitable treatment for patients with depression during glioblastoma treatment. These drugs do not appear to affect the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy or compromise survival. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) can be used for the assessment of depression in patients with glioblastoma with the caveat that results may be skewed in patients with hemiparesis, hemianopia, hemisensory neglect or dysphagia. Although seizures are a common symptom in patients with glioblastoma, prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs outside the perioperative phase is not advised. First-generation antiepileptic drugs may interact with other medications; the preferred antiepileptic agents are lamotrigine, levetiracetam, pregabalin and valproic acid. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with intrinsic brain tumors. Glioma is not a contraindication to standard anticoagulation in patients with established thrombosis, but prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended. Instead, clinicians and patients need to be vigilant for any signs or symptoms of VTE. Steroid treatment (usually dexamethasone, 8-16 mg per day) will decrease tumor-associated edema and improve symptoms. Lower doses may be equally effective.

There is a significant multifactorial delay in the presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to the neurologist, at which point the diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds alone. There are very few credible ALS mimic disorders (and even fewer that are reversible). The ALS spectrum comprises lower motor neuron-predominant, upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant and symmetric limb syndromes. Fasciculation as a primary symptom and without associated weakness is nearly always benign. Incidental spinal spondylosis is common among those with ALS and, if not carefully considered, it may lead to diagnostic delay and inappropriate surgical intervention. Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block is much rarer than ALS and has a younger age of onset, most commonly manifesting as unilateral 'finger drop'. Primary lateral sclerosis is very rare, has a younger age of onset and has at least 4 years before it can be differentiated confidently from UMN-predominant forms of ALS, which progress more slowly. ALS is the most common cause of progressive dysarthria followed by dysphagia.

Early in the course of the disease, patients most need clear information, advice and counseling. Multidisciplinary therapy and input from a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist (PDNS) should be available to all patients at all stages of the disease. The PDNS is ideally placed to recognize when palliative care is needed, and to initiate and support the appropriate care. Physiotherapy is particularly useful at a stage when balance problems become obvious. In early Parkinson's disease, patients should be encouraged to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables to stimulate a sluggish bowel. Although a large protein intake may compete with levodopa absorption, patients should not restrict their total protein intake. Hallucinations often presage cognitive decline with memory difficulties and disorientation, the most difficult problems for both patients and carers; drugs that are most likely to cause hallucinosis should be withdrawn immediately. Bladder symptoms, sleep problems and sexual problems are common, and need to be addressed. Skin problems are common, but patients rarely complain of them; drug rashes may necessitate withdrawal of the offending agent. Patients and carers should be given the chance to discuss end-of-life issues at the appropriate time with suitably trained professionals.

Patients with poor left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction < 35%), who are symptomatic on optimal medical treatment, with broad QRS complexes (> 120 ms) and left bundle branch block should be referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy. With evolving technology, the complication rate of left ventricle assist devices and total artificial hearts will decline and their use will significantly increase as a bridge to transplantation and as destination therapy. Assuming that the candidate pool (patients with end-stage heart failure [HF]) continues to grow, the burden on healthcare systems worldwide could become significant. Cardiac transplantation remains a viable option in selected individuals with end-stage HF despite the shortage of donor organs; steady improvement in survival after cardiac transplantation has been observed.

Switching between biological drugs is a key mechanism for driving down costs. 'Interchangeable' has different meanings in the USA and Europe. In the USA, interchangeability is the automatic substitution of prescriptions at a pharmacy level, whereas in Europe it refers to a physician-led decision, often at the level of the medicines formulary committee. European regulators support the safety of biosimilar switching as part of an annual tender process. In Europe, individual countries may have patent laws that prevent the extrapolation of indications for biosimilars, even if the indication has been approved by the European Medicines Agency. Similar regulations allowing for limited indications because of patent protection are also occurring in the US market.

The immune system has two components: innate immunity, involving mechanisms present throughout life, and adaptive (acquired) immunity, which is conferred by immune responses following exposure to an antigen, and is specific to that antigen. Innate immunity is primarily conferred by phagocytic cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow, principally macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils. There are two forms of adaptive immunity: cellular immunity mediated by T cells originating in the thymus, and humoral immunity mediated by B cells originating in the bone marrow. In cellular immunity, T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.- Activation of CD4+ T cells leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells, including APCs.- Activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells triggers clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells, which release enzymes and toxins that lyse the membrane of antigen-bearing cells and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). Humoral immunity involves the production by B cells of antibodies against specific antigens. Immune tolerance is a state in which the immune system is unresponsive to a stimulus that would normally provoke an immune response. This may be central or peripheral, depending on where tolerance develops. Immune tolerance is an important mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system.

Surgery is the preferred treatment for all patients with early-stage (I-II) NSCLC, with radiotherapy reserved for those unsuitable for surgery. Stereotactic body radiotherapy is an alternative to surgery in peripheral stage I-II tumors less than 5 cm. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is preferred to sequential chemoradiotherapy in stage IIB-IIIB disease. Postoperative radiotherapy is recommended when residual disease is present; it can also be discussed in patients with complete resections with pN2 disease. Patients with advanced disease and poor performance status should receive 10 Gy in 1 fraction for palliation of intrathoracic disease.

Cigarette addiction involves powerful motivations to smoke that undermine and overwhelm the desire to avoid smoking because of its social, financial and health costs. Cigarette addiction stems primarily from nicotine dependence.- Repeated rapid intake of nicotine from cigarettes sets up a powerful association between smoking and situations in which smoking typically occurs.- It also creates 'nicotine hunger' so that when brain nicotine levels fall, the smoker experiences a need to smoke.- It creates unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, including mood disturbance, because of physiological adaptation. The withdrawal symptoms are relieved by smoking, thus generating the feeling of a need to smoke whenever these symptoms are experienced, even if they are caused by something else. Addiction to cigarettes is demonstrated by the fact that fewer than 5% of serious attempts to stop smoking succeed without behavioral support or pharmacological treatment.

Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with a prevalence of approximately 200 per 100 000 individuals. The incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease increases sharply with age. Men are 1.5 times more likely than women to develop the disease. Pathologically, Parkinson's disease is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration including that of neuromelanin-containing neurons, as well as deficits in the serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic systems that result in the manifestation of motor and non-motor symptoms. Lewy bodies in the remaining nigral neurons are a pathological hallmark of the disease after death. The cause of neuronal degeneration is uncertain. Braak has suggested that the condition may begin in the olfactory bundle and lower brainstem, and studies are under way to identify specific non-motor biomarkers of the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD), late-onset hyposmia, constipation and major depression are all risk factors for Parkinson's disease. At present, there are no guidelines for genetic testing in Parkinson's disease. Genetic tests for common mutations such as LRRK2 Gly2019Ser mutations in at-risk individuals (European, North African and Ashkenazi Jewish), glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) mutations, or Parkin (autosomal recessive) are usually available if they are thought to be clinically relevant and necessary. Where possible, advice from a genetic counselor must be obtained before genetic testing.

Pathologically, Parkinson's disease is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration including that of neuromelanin-containing neurons, as well as deficits in the serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic systems that result in the manifestation of motor and non-motor symptoms. Lewy bodies in the remaining nigral neurons are a pathological hallmark of the disease after death. The cause of neuronal degeneration is uncertain. Braak has suggested that the condition may begin in the olfactory bundle and lower brainstem, and studies are under way to identify specific non-motor biomarkers of the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease. Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD), late-onset hyposmia, constipation and major depression are all risk factors for Parkinson's disease. At present, there are no guidelines for genetic testing in Parkinson's disease. Genetic tests for common mutations such as LRRK2 Gly2019Ser mutations in at-risk individuals (European, North African and Ashkenazi Jewish), glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) mutations, or Parkin (autosomal recessive) are usually available if they are thought to be clinically relevant and necessary. Where possible, advice from a genetic counselor must be obtained before genetic testing.
