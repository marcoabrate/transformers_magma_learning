The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods.
There are a range of treatments that may be effective for depression, and matching management intensity to the level of depression severity - termed 'stepped care' - is a widely adopted framework for care.
For milder forms of depression, self-help, relaxation, sleep hygiene, exercise and problem-solving therapy are likely to be effective; for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants or a structured psychological treatment (cognitive-behavior therapy) is indicated; combined antidepressants and psychological therapy may be most appropriate for severe depression.
Depression is complex, and understanding and helping requires a sensitive weighing up of the many factors that are relevant to the individuals and families affected.
Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the first-choice medication but prior treatment history, medical history and drug interactions are key considerations in treatment selection.
The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age, and women are at higher risk than men.
Transabdominal ultrasound is the imaging test of choice, with an accuracy of over 95%, for the diagnosis of gallstones in either acute or chronic cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
Acalculous cholecystitis may occur in critically ill patients; the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.
Patients with gallbladder polyps more than 1 cm in size should be considered for cholecystectomy owing to the increased risk of malignancy.
Gallbladder cancer is the most common gastrointestinal cancer in Native Americans in the USA and also has a very high incidence in certain Latin American countries, particularly Chile.
Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life.
When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions.
The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures.
Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures.
Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace.
Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients.
Patients with epilepsy may have difficulty in finding affordable life insurance.
Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures without unduly limiting activities.
The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. Some patients with PK deficiency may tolerate a lower level of hemoglobin than those with other anemias due to increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.
Splenectomy is beneficial in increasing the hemoglobin level and decreasing the need for transfusions in most patients with PK deficiency.
The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors.
Given the potential risks associated with splenectomy, physicians should participate in shared decision making with their patients to determine whether to pursue splenectomy and at what age.
The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis in PK deficiency is similar (approximately 10%) to other non-malignant hematologic conditions.
This wider choice of AEDs permits pharmacological treatment to be better matched to the individual patient's circumstances.
Sixteen new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy since the late 1980s.
AEDs differ substantially in their mechanisms of action, spectra of activity, and pharmacokinetic and side-effect profiles.
Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and place a huge burden on healthcare resources.
Most exacerbations of COPD are managed at home, but those with suspected respiratory failure should be admitted to hospital.
The main etiologic factors in acute exacerbations are bacterial infection, respiratory viruses and air pollution.
Exacerbations can be prevented by inhaled corticosteroids and vaccination against influenza.
Treatment includes oxygen, increased use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and short-term oral glucocorticosteroids.
Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.
People with schizophrenia exhibit gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices.
People with schizophrenia have decreased volume of subcortical structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus and thalamus.
A subgroup of patients may exhibit progressive changes in brain structure over the course of their illness.
Men with schizophrenia have been found to have greater volume reductions in the temporal lobes than women.
Hallucinations, delusions and positive formal thought disorder are associated with decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus.
Diffusion tensor imaging studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal connections among cortical and subcortical structures.
Comprehensive genomic profiles offer a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor. The interpretation of the different variants reported, with attention focused on their clinical significance and usefulness for cancer patients, can support oncologists to make informed cancer treatment decisions.
The clinical and pathological significance of several molecular variants, including SNVs, CNVs and indels, remains unknown.
WES or wide gene panels may be employed to assess TMB status to guide immunotherapy decisions.
Some therapies are indicated for MSI-H cancer, and others are in clinical trials. Careful attention should be paid to the accuracy of the MMR evaluation (IHC, PCR or NGS).
RNA-based molecular approaches play a pivotal role in the identification of targetable gene fusions and splice variants.
Having a close relative with schizophrenia increases one's own risk 15-fold.
Identical twins show a 45% concordance rate.
Copy number variants are rare major genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
Individual vulnerability genes exist, which are each of small effect and interact with other genes and with environmental factors.
A growing number of susceptibility genes have been identified, some of which also predispose to bipolar disorder.
Usually (in 80% of patients) there is a significant smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. For those with lesser smoking histories or for younger individuals, consider an alternative diagnosis or a genetic predisposition (exempli gratia alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency).
The most common symptom in COPD is breathlessness on exertion.
Clinical indicators include signs of overinflation, prominent use of accessory muscles of respiration, weight loss, expiratory wheeze, cyanosis, peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure. These are usually apparent only in severe disease.
COPD occurs, though less commonly, in those who do not smoke.
Dyspnea may be discounted by patients until disease is severe, as breathlessness can be avoided by restricting activity.
Physical signs often present only at an advanced stage of the disease.
The systemic effects of COPD result in a number of comorbidities that impact on the morbidity and mortality of the disease.
The full spectrum of COPD can now be better identified using new classifications of disease that take into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation.
Thrombocytopenia may occur with some inherited disorders of platelet function, such as the Bernard-Soulier, gray platelet and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes.
Platelet transfusion has limited indications and should be used sparingly, because it may transmit infection or sensitize the recipient to platelet antigens.
Inhibitors of platelet function, such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), should be avoided in individuals with disorders of platelet function and those with thrombocytopenia.
In immune thrombocytopenia, bleeding is uncommon if the platelet count exceeds 10 x 10 /L and aggressive interventions (exempli gratia high-dose corticosteroids, splenectomy) are not usually indicated.
Gestational thrombocytopenia is common and requires no treatment, but it must be distinguished from primary immune thrombocytopenia.
Epilepsy has many underlying etiologies.
A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures.
A witness's account is essential for accurate diagnosis of epilepsy and classification of seizures.
Structural brain imaging is essential in the diagnostic work-up for patients with seizures suspected of having a focal onset.
Electroencephalography can support diagnosis and help with the classification of seizures and syndromes.
MRI is the imaging modality of choice for detecting structural abnormalities in the brain.
Functional neuroimaging techniques are mainly used as supplementary investigations in patients being considered for epilepsy surgery.
The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are based on abnormalities of peripheral blood counts and alterations in bone marrow morphology.
The diagnostic approach to essential thrombocythemia (ET) generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis.
In contrast to ET, polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and in primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
The presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include symptomatic splenomegaly, anemia, constitutional symptoms (exempli gratia fatigue, pruritus), thrombosis and bleeding.
In addition to the risk of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life.
An individual patient's risk of vascular complications and disease progression depends on multiple clinical and molecular risk factors. Since the level of risk will influence treatment decisions, effective risk stratification is essential for effective management of MPNs. Risk stratification models have been developed for all three MPNs.
Better subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare wedge resection and segmentectomy.
New M1c staging for multiple metastases in one or several organs and the use of the term M1b for oligometastatic disease has the potential to provide rational selection criteria for clinical treatment trials.
Ground glass opacity (GGO) visualized on high-resolution computed tomography should trigger careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy.
Some locally advanced lung cancers benefit from multimodality therapy, which can include surgery.
Tumor types that occur in the ampullary and periampullary regions may have a much better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Patients with inherited neuroendocrine tumors require genetic counseling and long-term follow-up for pancreatic and other tumor types.
Solitary metastases to the pancreas may be worth resecting.
Neuroendocrine tumors should usually be removed surgically.
Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team.
Cystic pancreatic tumors need to be differentiated from pancreatic pseudocysts, but only a minority need resection at the time of diagnosis.
Pathological diagnosis is critical to select appropriate therapy.
Aggressive therapy may improve outcome in elderly patients.
It may or may not be necessary to modify specific therapies for the elderly because of the risk of toxicity.
Clinical trials are needed to address issues specific to elderly patients with brain tumors.
Neurocognitive outcome is of particular concern in elderly patients with brain tumors.
A wide range of targeted agencies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently in the late stages of development, including FLT3 inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, giltertinib, sorafenib), hypomethylating agents (guadecitabine, oral azacitidine), the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat, the blc-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the E-selectin inhibitor GM-1271.
Key to all approaches to the treatment of AML is the need to achieve disease control, and continued consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation when feasible.
Immunologic therapies, antibody-drug conjugates and antibody-based approaches are also being explored in AML.
The approval of enasidenib based on single-arm Phase I/II data is challenging the dogma that large randomized controlled trials in a general AML population are required. Trials of new targeted agents are likely to be in small, clearly defined patients with subtypes of AML.
The Beat AML trial is using early and comprehensive genetic characterization to assign patients to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations, each receiving a tailored treatment. This approach will hopefully speed up the development of promising agents.
Acne is a hormonally mediated disease.
Four main factors are implicated in the etiology of acne:- high sebum production- hyperkeratinization of the intrafollicular duct- colonization by Propionibacterium acnes- inflammation.
There are many myths about the factors that influence acne; patients should be made aware of the appropriate facts (see Table 8.1, pages 83-4 ).
Assessment of functional class, based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic heart failure (HF) as it is linked to outcome.
The hemodynamic profile of acute HF varies according to the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold).
Atrial arrhythmias contribute to a reduction in functional capacity, while ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF.
Also key to the diagnosis of HF is the assessment of ejection fraction, underlying etiology and precipitating factors, and the role of coronary artery disease.
Investigations in patients with HF include blood tests, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and other imaging techniques.
Functional testing is of particular value in patients deemed suitable candidates for devices or transplantation.
Positive symptoms are hypothesized to be due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway.
Negative symptoms are hypothesized to be due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway.
The dopamine hypothesis remains the major neurochemical hypothesis of schizophrenia.
Altered glutamate activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of negative and positive symptoms and cognitive impairments.
Disturbances in the cholinergic and GABAergic systems have been hypothesized to underlie cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.
Epstein-Barr virus and CD30 are expressed in several subtypes of PTCL.
Detailed immunophenotypic analysis is necessary to accurately diagnose PTCL subtypes.
Many patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas present with systemic symptoms, and extranodal involvement is common.
PET scanning can be helpful to diagnose extranodal disease.
The International Prognostic Index and the PTCL-specific index are useful prognostic tools.
In patients without history of chronic headaches, determine whether an acute new headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition.
In chronic headache:- use a headache diary to differentiate headache type and establish pattern of triggers to enable self-management strategies- institute preventive measures such as trigger avoidance, stress control and medication- institute abortive regimen appropriate for headache type- migraine: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress control, triptans- tension/myofascial: NSAIDs, stress control, icing, stretching- avoid regular frequent analgesic use to reduce incidence of transform (rebound) headache physical dependency.
The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of the surrounding brain tissue and from the effects of increased intracranial pressure due to increasing tumor size and surrounding edema.
The trajectory of the disease varies widely from patient to patient depending on the location of the tumor and other patient- and treatment-related factors. Patients with glioblastoma should be treated on an individual basis according to their symptom burden at different phases of the disease course.
The most prevalent symptoms of glioblastoma are neurological in nature. Apart from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life (exempli gratia anorexia, weight loss) in patients receiving palliative care for other forms of cancer are less common in patients with glioblastoma.
Seizures and cognitive deficits tend to be seen throughout the trajectory of the disease. Headache and dizziness are more common in the early diagnostic phase, and nausea/vomiting, visual deficits and anorexia are more prevalent during treatment. Confusion, dysphagia, dyspnea, aphasia, drowsiness and fatigue are more prevalent at the end of life.
The incidence of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is approximately 2.6 per 100 000.
Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is the most common, with an incidence of approximately 1.0 per 100 000, followed by polycythemia vera (PV) (0.8) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (0.5).
Recent data from the UK suggest that the incidence of ET and PV is similar in men and women, whereas PMF is twice as common in men.
MPNs primarily affect older individuals: the median age at diagnosis is 70-74 years.
ET and PV are associated with near-normal life expectancy whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival.
Risk factors that may increase the risk of MPNs include higher body mass index, smoking and some occupational exposures.
Surgery is one of the cornerstones of treatment for ovarian cancer.
The key aims of surgery are tumor removal and accurate staging.
Multivisceral surgery is needed to achieve complete tumor resection.
Surgery for relapsed disease is associated with significant prolongation of progression-free survival in prospective studies; data for overall survival are not yet mature, but in retrospective series patients who are tumor free after surgery at relapse have significantly longer overall survival than those with residual tumor.
Peritoneal carcinomatosis is associated with lower complete debulking rates at relapse, but not with inferior overall survival in tumor-free patients who undergo surgery.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relatively rare cancer. It is due to proliferation of immature myeloid cells, which interfere with the production of normal red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients typically require transfusion support and are at risk for potentially fatal infection. AML is uniformly fatal without treatment.
AML is the most common acute leukemia in older adults, with median age at diagnosis of 67-69 years.
Long-term survival of patients with AML is poor: about a quarter of patients survive 5 years but only 10% of older patients.
Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time.
Most cases of AML are idiopathic; however, prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents increases the risk of AML.
Inherited risk is uncommon but is likely to be more frequent than is currently understood.
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease.
Early intervention prevents permanent injury, but interrupting alcoholism can be difficult.
Patients with ALD typically have mild to moderate elevations in aminotransferases, with AST > ALT.
Patients with ALD are often malnourished; improving nutrition is an important treatment goal.
Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis may benefit from corticosteroids or pentoxifylline.
The epidemiology of lymphoma is difficult to study owing to the existence of so many different subtypes of the disease, each with its own epidemiology and associated causative factors.
The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s but has plateaued in recent years.
An understanding of the epidemiology has, in some instances, led to an understanding of causative factors such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.
Various other subtypes of lymphoma have been linked with infection, particularly immunosuppression-related lymphomas caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas caused by various bacterial infections.
Large cohort studies are required to verify many of the potential causative factors.
Autoimmune liver disease can target the hepatocyte or any element of the bile duct system.
Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is potentially treatable if diagnosed before the development of cirrhosis.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and is unpredictable; late disease can be managed effectively with liver transplantation unless complicated by cholangiocarcinoma.
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease, with a presymptomatic period of up to 20 years.
Liver transplantation is an excellent treatment for end-stage AIH and PBC.
Gaps remain in our understanding of the epidemiology of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency because many cases are believed to go unreported.
About one quarter of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency will have a previously unrecorded mutation in the PKLR gene.
Approximately 70% of mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense mutations.
Some mutations are seen more frequently in specific regions and populations.
Acquired PK deficiency very rarely can occur secondarily to other blood diseases.
Diabetic pregnancy is associated with fetal morbidity.
Miscarriage rates are high in diabetic pregnancy.
The congenital malformation rate is 5.1-9.8%.
Both growth restriction and growth acceleration may complicate diabetic pregnancy.
Fetal macrosomia increases the likelihood of birth injury.
Strict glycemic control improves the outcome of diabetic pregnancy.
GDM is becoming increasingly common, particularly in certain ethnic groups.
Treatment of GDM is associated with improved fetal outcome.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance with onset during pregnancy.
Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness or TLoC).
Syncope can be benign, such as vasovagal (neurocardiogenic), although it may still be disabling for some patients with recurrent fainting spells. Syncope can also be serious with a potentially fatal outcome, such as ventricular arrhythmias or heart block.
Recurrent presyncope (the sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness) is common and may culminate in syncope over time.
Syncope in patients with known structural heart disease, particularly impaired left ventricular function, carries a significantly worse prognosis with an increased risk of sudden death.
The differential diagnosis is complicated by the fact that patients with cardiac syncope often do not remember the loss of consciousness and therefore only consider that they have had a fall. Always try to find a witness to the incident.
Instances of sudden unheralded blackout without prodromal symptoms and with brief loss of consciousness are almost certainly cardiac in origin.
Syncope with or without palpitations requires prompt referral.
Not all patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) need or want dialysis, and some may be managed conservatively.
Hemodialysis requires excellent vascular access; problems with access cause significant morbidity.
Peritoneal dialysis is an excellent modality for many patients, especially early in ESKD.
Most patients will require several modalities of renal replacement therapy in their lifetime.
Transplantation offers the best long-term outcomes, but at the expense of long-term side effects from immunosuppression, including cancers and cardiovascular disease.
Most women on dialysis are infertile. Fertility is restored after transplantation, but pregnant transplant recipients have an increased risk of hypertension, miscarriage in the first trimester and premature delivery.
Public health preventative measures are likely to have the greatest influence on bladder cancer outcomes globally.
Earlier diagnosis will shift the pattern of disease towards more favorable stage and grade cancers.
Outcomes in advanced disease are likely to improve through the uptake of new therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as better application of existing evidence and treatments.
Multidisciplinary management and extended supportive and palliative care measures will increasingly be adopted and improve cancer outcomes and quality of life.
Improved biological characterization of tumors may point towards more appropriate and patient-specific treatments, including those aimed at specific molecular targets.
Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately.
Fear over the toxicity of levodopa has resulted in levodopa phobia in some patients; however, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited.
Dopamine agonists are useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa therapy; some, such as rotigotine, may offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation in practice and specifically offer night-time and early morning benefit.
Impuse control disorders have emerged as a major complication of mostly dopamine agonist treatment, and monitoring is a must.
Treatment decisions should be based on the degree of disability, occupational needs, age, patient/clinician preference and adherence issues; neuroprotection remains a theoretical argument, while dyskinesias and wearing off are an important consideration in younger patients.
Trial data indicate that treatment of Parkinson's disease could be initiated with levodopa, oral dopamine agonists or a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor. The PD MED study seems to suggest that initial therapy with levodopa offers a small but persistent benefit compared with the alternatives, and initial MAOB inhibitor treatment is at least as effective as a dopamine agonist.
The findings of the PDLIFE study suggest that early initiation of treatment may be beneficial in terms of health-related quality of life.
The treatment of non-motor symptoms is important at all stages of Parkinson's disease. The results of the PANDA study may help people with Parkinson's-associated pain.
Most patients with blurred vision have benign, slowly progressive conditions and can be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. However, blurred vision may also be the first symptom of potentially sight- or life-threatening disease, and patients suspected of having a serious cause of blurred vision must be referred urgently.
All people over 40 should be encouraged to have regular eye checks by their optometrist to look for early signs of glaucoma and other eye disease. Chronic glaucoma is usually asymptomatic until it is very advanced.
Please check that all your practice's diabetic patients are enrolled for regular eye screening to detect diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy is best treated at an asymptomatic stage to prevent visual loss.
Always consider temporal arteritis if a patient over 50 complains of sudden loss of vision or transient blurring of vision.
Different sample types (histological or cytological) have distinct advantages and disadvantages; these are a key issue in molecular analysis.
Standardization in molecular reporting is very important.
Laboratories should pay careful attention to costs and reimbursement systems for molecular analysis.
Discussing a patient's results and management at an MTB meeting may help to overcome challenging issues.
There are several syndromes associated with an inherited predisposition to a variety of brain tumors. However, the vast majority of brain tumors are not inherited.
Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate surveillance of individuals at high risk of developing an occult brain tumor or associated disease and for genetic counseling.
Recent advances in the molecular biology of familial brain tumor syndromes have suggested new therapies that have the potential to dramatically change the manifestations of these diseases.
Cysts are common imaging findings; location, imaging characteristics and other features may help to establish the most likely diagnosis.
Dermoids and epidermoids are benign congenital lesions that typically produce symptoms as they gradually increase in size. Total or subtotal resection is the treatment of choice.
Colloid cysts should be resected using modern microneuro-surgical techniques.
Early neurodevelopmental, non-genetic risk factors exist for schizophrenia.
Like genetic factors, environmental factors are many and varied.
Birth complications increase the child's risk of schizophrenia in later life fourfold.
Psychosocial risk factors are being re-established as important risk factors.
Cannabis use increases the risk of schizophrenia as well as relapse.
Evidence for specific gene-environment interactions is beginning to emerge.
Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks.
Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy. Increased use of relievers (short-acting beta -agonists) indicates inadequate disease control.
Asthma therapy should be tailored to disease severity; current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment.
Any exacerbation should prompt a review of maintenance medications.
If recommended treatment fails, adherence and diagnosis should be re-examined before treatment is escalated.
All patients with asthma should have a written asthma action plan.
Behavioral therapy, alongside diet and lifestyle advice, is one of the three key components of obesity management.
A person's degree of motivation and expectations should be assessed.
Techniques include goal setting, self-monitoring and stimulus control.
Binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome are specific eating disorders and should be treated accordingly.
After an initial response to androgen ablation, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value starts to rise as a result of androgen-insensitive cell clones.
As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen.
Immunotherapy for CRPC may be best implemented before significant symptoms appear.
The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy. The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone is now also licensed for use before chemotherapy, and trials of other antiandrogens prior to chemotherapy are under way.
When docetaxel chemotherapy has failed, second-line therapies such as cabazitaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone (a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis), enzalutamide (an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor) and radium-223 (targeted alpha therapy) have been shown to improve survival and quality of life.
External-beam radiotherapy may provide useful control of pain from bone metastases.
The monoclonal antibody denosumab and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have been reported to significantly delay bone-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer.
The Janus kinase 2 inhibitor pacritinib was superior to best available therapy in patients with myelofibrosis in terms of spleen and symptom responses.
A variety of new therapies directed against diverse molecular targets are currently being evaluated.
Other potential therapeutic targets include signaling pathways, histone deacetylase, telomerase, DNA methyltransferase and blockade of erythropoietin inhibitors.
The use of ruxolitinib in combination with new therapies may offer a further potential approach to treatment.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for Leber congenital amaurosis and spinal muscular atrophy are now approved medicines in the USA and rely on in vivo injection to, respectively, the subretinal space and systemic circulation.
Multiple gene therapies for hemophilia, based on hepatic AAV gene transfer, have elevated coagulation factor activities in patients to the normal or near normal range. These are now being evaluated in Phase III trials.
Gene therapy, using gene-modified cells or in vivo gene transfer, has now been successful for diverse diseases and modes of gene transfer.
After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies for blood cancers, targeting the CD19 antigen, are in use to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adults.
Obesity significantly affects cardiometabolic status and risk.
The metabolic syndrome defines the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors under the umbrella of obesity.
Lipid disorders and hypertension are exacerbated by obesity and add to cardiovascular risk.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the comorbidity most closely linked with obesity. Weight loss prevents the disease in those at risk and improves glycemic control when it is present.
Weight loss rapidly and effectively reduces cardiovascular risk and the burden of atrial fibrillation, and improves cardiac function.
