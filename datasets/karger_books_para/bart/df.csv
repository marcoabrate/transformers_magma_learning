9781905832729,ch_2,The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system.,"Continence is maintained by a complex interaction between the bladder, the urethra, the pelvic floor muscles, the endopelvic fascia and the nervous system. The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system, pressure increasing slowly and steadily as the bladder fills, normally at a rate of 0.5-5 mL/minute. It can usually hold 500-600 mL urine. A first need to void is felt when the bladder contains 250-300 mL. Continence is maintained as long as the urethral pressure exceeds the bladder pressure.",114,13,0.11403508771929824
9781905832729,ch_2,"Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord, the micturition center in the midbrain and the somatic and parasympathetic nervous systems.","During normal voiding, voluntary relaxation of the striated musculature in and around the urethra precedes contraction of the detrusor (bladder) muscle. The bladder neck and proximal urethra (often referred to as the 'bladder outlet') become funnel shaped. This relaxation/contraction combination reduces outflow resistance and increases intravesical (in the bladder) pressure, causing the bladder to be emptied forcibly. Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord and the micturition center in the midbrain. Both the autonomic and somatic nervous systems are involved. The innervation of the bladder is shown in Figure 1.2. The main neurological pathways that affect bladder contraction are parasympathetic. The sacral reflex center is situated in S2 to S4, and the pelvic nerve and its branches lead from here to the detrusor muscle. Excitation of these nerves stimulates the release primarily of acetylcholine, which acts on muscarinic receptors to cause detrusor contraction.",216,38,0.17592592592592593
9781905832729,ch_2,"Voiding requires a coordinated contraction of the detrusor (bladder smooth musculature), simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary). Continence requires the converse.","During normal bladder filling, there is no excitatory input from the micturition center in the brain to the sacral micturition center or from the sacral micturition center to the pelvic nerves. The detrusor (bladder) is quiescent. There is a gradual increase in the tone of the external sphincter (striated muscle), mediated through impulses via the pudendal nerve. Voiding depends on coordinated excitation of the sacral parasympathetic nerves and simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary); continence requires the converse (Table 1.1). Storage and voluntary emptying of the bladder are also influenced by psychological and sociocultural factors. Adults are trained to void in a socially acceptable place and women may not want or like to void in any other place than their homes because of concern about unsafe or unsanitary toilet facilities. Using a toilet away from home can cause psychological stress, suppression of the desire to void and infrequent voiding. Voiding position and posture (exempli gratia squatting or sitting) used by women to empty the bladder differs by cultures or by health status. Negative perceptions of the physical environment of toilets can alter toileting stance or suppress the desire to void.",279,54,0.1935483870967742

The term encompasses histological cellular proliferation (microscopic BPH) and consequent prostate enlargement (macroscopic BPH). The term BPE indicates benign prostatic enlargement, usually due to BPH, while BPO indicates benign prostatic obstruction, a common cause of bladder outlet obstruction. Microscopic BPH is seen in about 25% of men aged 40-50 years, 50% of men aged 50-60 years, 65% of men aged 60-70 years, 80% of men aged 70-80 years and 90% of men aged 80-90 years. It is estimated that 25-50% of men with microscopic and macroscopic BPH (BPE) will develop lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPO. However, far fewer men complain about these symptoms than of BPH, and even fewer seek help because of these symptoms. The cause of BPH is not fully understood. The hormonal theory postulates that estrogen-androgen synergism associated with aging drives prostatic growth.

The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is now established for glioblastoma. A recently completed randomized phase III study has demonstrated improved survival for patients receiving chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment. This trial demonstrated that daily temozolomide chemotherapy for the duration of radiotherapy (75 mg/kg/m /day for 42 consecutive days) followed by adjuvant temozolomide for 6 cycles (150-200 mg/m /day for days 1-5/28 days) was more effective than radiotherapy alone for patients with glioblastoma following surgery. In this study, more than 25% of patients who received temozolomide and radiotherapy had a 2-year survival compared with 10% for those receiving radiotherapy alone. Additionally, nearly 50% of patients who had tumors with a methylated phenotype had a 2-year survival following combined modality therapy. A recent analysis of this trial has shown prolonged survival and long-term control in a significant subset of patients, demonstrating that the benefit of this regimen can persist for years for some patients with this otherwise rapidly fatal cancer. Despite this very important therapeutic advance, most individuals with glioblastomas will experience tumor recurrence within 2 years of the initial diagnosis. Tumor recurrence is usually local and confined to the brain. At recurrence, further surgery and chemotherapy can extend life in a minority of patients. The most common chemotherapeutic agents in current use for malignant gliomas are listed in Table 5.3. A number of experimental treatments are under investigation for glioblastoma, including immunotherapy, viral therapy, signal-transduction inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents. The most promising new agent for glioblastoma is bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Bevacizumab is the most advanced of a variety of antiangiogenic therapies for cancer (see Table 3.4), and has recently been approved for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in several countries including the USA and Canada. When administered to patients with glioblastoma, bevacizumab has the potential to reduce cerebral edema (thereby reducing the need for corticosteroids), and to cause very dramatic reduction of tumor enhancement on MRI scans. While the use of bevacizumab can improve symptoms and delay progression in a significant fraction of patients with glioblastoma, the impact of this agent on survival remains unclear. Bevacizumab is generally well tolerated, with the most common toxicity being hypertension. It has the potential to interfere with wound healing and induce venous thromboembolism, intracranial hemorrhage and bowel perforation, though these serious complications are very uncommon. Studies are under way to further define the use of bevacizumab in patients with glioblastoma, including very large phase III trials in patients with newly diagnosed disease.",623,123,0.19743178170144463

9781908541062,ch_3,Genetic and environmental factors both play a role in the etiology of RA. A number of genetic associations with RA have now been identified.,"Non-MHC genes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized our understanding of complex diseases such as RA. The human genome sequencing project highlighted the abundance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human DNA. These are single base-pair differences in DNA sequence between different individuals, which do not usually change the function of the gene. The development of high-throughput genotyping technologies has enabled large-scale GWAS in which hundreds of thousands of SNPs that span the entire genome are rapidly compared in patients with a particular disease and matched controls. SNPs that appear more commonly in individuals with the disease in question should lie within or close to genes that are associated with the disease. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium published the first GWAS of RA and, with subsequent studies, has identified and confirmed a number of genes associated with the disease. These include genes encoding proteins such as protein tyrosine phosphatase-22 (PTPN22), an important regulator of lymphocyte activation, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), a downregulator of T cell activation, and STAT4, a signaling molecule downstream of the interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 receptor. Table 2.1 lists genetic loci that have been reproducibly linked to RA in populations of European descent. It has been estimated that approximately 35% of the genetic risk for RA has now been established, most of which is attributable to the MHC.

If the individual smokes, the OR increases to approximately 23 times. PTPN22 also contributes to RA risk in this model, which clearly demonstrates the influence of smoking on RA development (Figure 2.3). Smoking appears to interact with the shared epitope, leading to the production of ACPA, perhaps via the citrullination of proteins in the lung, thereby increasing their immunogenicity. (Citrullination is the post-translational modification of an arginine to form citrulline [ see 6.i ].) Other airborne exposures, for example to silica dust and coal dust, have also been associated with the development of RA.

By interacting with membrane receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) on osteoclast precursors, RANKL results in their differentiation and activation, ultimately leading to bone destruction.

Furthermore, it is now recognized that the pathology of atherosclerosis bears many resemblances to that of RA, in terms of cellular and pro-inflammatory mediators, as well as in the destructive enzymes that result in plaque rupture. Therefore, whether enhanced atherosclerosis is purely secondary to RA manifestations or intrinsically linked to its pathogenesis awaits further study.

RA occurs in all societies, with no clear geographic or climatic influence. On the other hand there is variation between communities. For example, there is a high prevalence (approximately 5%) in some Native American populations such as the Pima Indians. Similarly, a low prevalence has been reported in certain rural Chinese and Japanese communities. In Africa, a lower prevalence was reported in a rural than in an urban community. This could reflect a genuine difference in prevalence but could also be explained by other factors, such as a lower mortality from RA-associated infections in the town-dwellers or differences in the age structure of the two communities. Historically, RA has been considered a chronic disabling disease that does not shorten lifespan. This is untrue, however, and various studies have reported a standardized mortality ratio of between 1.3 and 3.0 compared with the general population. Consequently, life expectancy in severe RA is reduced, on average, by 7 years for men and 4 years for women.

Indirect costs represent the consequences of unemployment and reduced productivity. Intangible costs reflect the psychosocial consequences of RA that impact on psychological wellbeing and quality of life.

Unusual symptoms reflect the involvement of joints such as the crico-arytenoid joint of the larynx, with resultant hoarseness. Inflammation of synovium at extra-articular sites leads to tenosynovitis and bursitis. Tenosynovitis further compounds functional impairment, particularly of the hands and wrists. Bursitis causes pain at juxta-articular sites: for example, at the hip, where trochanteric bursitis is common. The tempo of onset is also variable, ranging from an acute dramatic presentation in up to one-third of cases to the classic insidious clinical picture, where symptoms may have been present for weeks or months before the patient sought medical advice.

Citrullinated epitopes are found in many peptides and proteins and are formed by the post-translational deimination of arginyl residues by the enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase (PADI). Autoantibodies recognizing these epitopes are named anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs), and recognize targets that are potential RA autoantigens, such as citrullinated filaggrin, fibrin, fibrinogen, collagen, alpha-enolase and vimentin. The identification of the ACPA targets that are most closely associated with RA is an area of active research because this should provide clues to etiology and pathogenesis. Several commercial assays are now available for ACPA detection, most of which use second-generation cyclic citrullinated peptide mixtures (CCP2) as the substrate.

A normochromic normocytic anemia suggests poorly controlled disease, as does a low serum albumin. There is no indication to repeat RF titers or ACPA in a seropositive patient, because they do not necessarily correlate with disease activity, but a seronegative patient may convert to seropositivity during the course of their illness. Any patient with poorly controlled disease, particularly if taking glucocorticoid therapy, should be considered for osteoporosis screening by dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or an alternative modality. It is reasonable to repeat radiology of involved joints every 1-2 years to document stabilization or progression of joint damage. Other radiological investigations should be guided by the clinical picture. For example, HRUS is increasingly used to document the presence or absence of synovitis in some cases of established RA where the clinical picture is complicated by a second condition, such as fibromyalgia.

9781908541062,ch_8,"Rheumatoid arthritis can be assessed using objective clinical scores such as swollen-joint counts, biochemical and radiological parameters such as acute-phase response and joint X-rays, and subjective measures of pain, function and participation.","Composite scores. RA is a complex disease and cannot be assessed using a single measure. Therefore, in accordance with the variable manifestations and outcomes of RA, composite assessment criteria have been devised, although debate continues regarding the 'minimal data set' needed to provide a reliable picture of the individual patient. The ACR response criteria were designed for assessing outcomes in the clinical trials setting. These measure changes from baseline in the number of tender and swollen joints, acute-phase response, a functional measure (exempli gratia HAQ score), visual analog scale for pain, and global assessment of disease by patient and physician, also on a visual analog scale. A 20% improvement in swollen and tender joint counts, and in three of the remaining five parameters, represents an ACR20 response. This is the minimum required for efficacy in most trials. ACR50 and ACR70 responses are calculated in a similar fashion. While useful for monitoring clinical trials, these scores have not been validated in the routine clinical setting. Furthermore, they relate to a particular baseline, and a given improvement may be more difficult to achieve from a less active baseline. Thus, a 20% improvement from a baseline of five swollen joints may be more difficult to achieve than from a baseline of 20 swollen joints. In contrast, the disease activity score (DAS; Figure 7.3) provides a continuous variable which does not require reference to a baseline. The DAS is a complex measure that was derived by studying a number of disease activity criteria in patients with variable disease activity, and applying assorted statistical measures, including discriminant analysis and multiple regression analysis. Because of its continuous nature, a patient can be assigned a meaningful DAS at any stage of their disease, and inter-patient comparisons can also be made. Increasingly, the DAS is being used in the routine clinic setting. It provides a longitudinal quantitative measure of RA activity by which to judge the effectiveness of current management and the need for adjustment. In the clinical trial setting, improvement targets can be defined as both a reduction in DAS and also a target level of DAS, providing for good, moderate and nil improvements.

JAK3 plays a crucial role in regulating leukocyte function, becoming activated following IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor. Once activated, JAK3 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the receptor, leading to the recruitment of specific signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The STATs are then phosphorylated and reorient as dimers; they are released from the receptor and translocate to the nucleus where they act as powerful regulators of gene transcription.

Disorder represents the crystallization of these interactions into syndromes which, in this case, are a developmental outcome, not simply the burgeoning of a latent biological deficit, as reductionist models of psychopathology would have it.","Societal influences. The preoccupation with body image and the drive to attain thinness that are characteristic of eating disorders relate to the idealized representation of the human figure within a given culture, and to the pressure to conform from peers and the media. In Western countries, the body dimensions of female cultural icons, such as fashion models and actresses, have become progressively thinner over the past decades, with a concomitant rise in disordered eating among women. Mounting evidence implicates the mass media in the promotion of body-image and eating disturbances, with the emphasis on dieting and other weight-control behaviors often targeted at women rather than men, thus paralleling the gender distribution of eating pathology. A longitudinal prospective study of ethnic Fijian adolescent girls demonstrated an increase in key indicators of disordered eating following novel prolonged television exposure to the aesthetic ideal. The internalization of societal pressures has been shown to have a clear effect on body dissatisfaction and eating dysregulation in population samples. The first diet in adolescent girls is most frequently triggered by comparison with others' appearance and their own self-ideal. Societal influences and internalization of the thin ideal may lead directly to body dissatisfaction and unhealthy eating, or may be mediated by more general psychological processes such as intrapersonal (self-esteem, mood, personality) or interpersonal functioning and/or emotional regulation and coping.

As mentioned in Chapter 1, the classification of 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' (EDNOS), the third diagnostic category of eating disorders in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), is given to cases that do not fulfill the full criteria for anorexia or bulimia, and is the most frequently given diagnosis for eating disorders. Examples of EDNOS diagnoses are. female patients who meet all the criteria for anorexia yet menstruate regularly. individuals who meet all the criteria for anorexia but despite significant weight loss maintain weight in the normal range. individuals who display combinations of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors but at lower frequencies than those stipulated in the criteria. EDNOS also includes two subsets of disorders that have been defined by specific diagnostic criteria and have received increasing research interest: binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES). Binge-eating disorder, or non-purging bulimia, is characterized as recurrent episodes of binge eating, accompanied by a sense of distress, and feelings of disgust, depression or guilt, without the subsequent inappropriate compensatory behaviors (purging or non-purging) associated with bulimia. Hence, BED is often associated with overweight or obesity. There is increasing consent in the literature to consider BED as its own diagnostic category because of its distinct features, treatment and prognosis compared with bulimia. The overall prevalence of BED has been estimated as 3.5% in women and 2.0% in men. Compared with anorexia and bulimia, the sex ratio is less uneven, with males making up about 40-50% of EDNOS diagnoses with a BED subcategory. Age of onset for BED is slightly higher than for bulimia, ranging from 17 to 32 years, with a mean of 25 years.

This is accompanied by a palpable localized region of deep, tender muscle induration.

This classification system, viewed by the ILAE as a work in progress, divides seizures into two major groups: partial and generalized (Table 2.1). Partial (or focal) seizures originate in a focal region of the cortex (Figure 2.1). They can be subdivided into those that do not impair consciousness (simple partial) and those that do (complex partial), which is useful for identifying patients whose safety may be compromised by loss of consciousness from their seizures. Partial seizures can also be classified according to their clinical manifestations, such as focal motor, and can spread rapidly to other cortical areas through neuronal networks, resulting in secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (Figure 2.2).",218,38,0.1743119266055046

The FVIII gene (also known as F8) is large at 186 kb in length and this may partly account for a greater risk of mutation (and therefore higher prevalence of hemophilia A) than that of FIX (also known as F9), which is only 34 kb. A large number of different mutations have been described that result in varying reductions in FVIII/FIX activity. Major disruption of either gene leads to severe hemophilia, whereas minor defects, such as a single base change, often result in a molecule that retains some of its functional activity and causes only mild hemophilia. About 50% of cases of severe hemophilia A result from a major inversion in intron 22 of the F8 gene, with a homologous region of the chromosome that lies 400 kb distant to the gene (known as the 'flip-tip' inversion, Figure 6.1). In those without a family history, this inversion may have occurred in meiosis during spermatogenesis in the patient's maternal grandfather. In the laboratory, with the current polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing techniques, it is now possible to characterize the specific mutation in each family. It is important to do this, because the clinical features are related to the mutation (exempli gratia the likelihood of an anti-FVIII antibody developing following treatment is higher with certain mutations), and because it makes identification of female carriers in the family much more straightforward.",327,24,0.07339449541284404

Following binding to thrombomodulin, thrombin activates the anticoagulant protein C, which also becomes depleted, predisposing to microvascular thrombosis.

In many countries, a marked increase in asthma deaths occurred in the 1960s, after which mortality decreased. In the UK, the mortality rate increased slightly during the 1980s, but the most recent data indicate that death rates are now falling. The greatest increase in mortality during the late 1970s and 1980s was seen in New Zealand (Figure 2.5). The reasons for this are unclear; the use of high doses of short-acting beta -agonists (SABAs), especially high-dose fenoterolin, has been associated with the increased mortality, but the evidence is inconclusive. Ethnic and socioeconomic factors may be at least partly responsible. In New Zealand, a large proportion of the increased mortality occurred in Maoris, and during the same period a similar increase occurred among black Americans living in inner-city areas of the USA. Studies of asthma deaths during this time suggested that a majority were preventable with the best available current treatment, and that factors such as poor access to healthcare may have been partly responsible.

These clinical measures of disease severity have been shown to correlate well with pathological markers of airway inflammation such as eosinophil numbers. However, classification of asthma by severity is not necessarily predictive of the amount or types of treatment required to achieve best asthma outcomes. Recent research using non-hierarchical and cluster approaches to diagnosis are identifying multiple disease phenotypes with varying inflammatory and cytokine profiles and differing physiological features, responses to treatment and natural histories. This level of complexity has yet to translate into treatment strategies, leaving us with treatment algorithms based on asthma control: an assessment of daytime and night-time symptoms, limitation of activities, the need for rescue reliever therapy, lung function, and exacerbation frequency and severity (see Chapter 4).",174,23,0.13218390804597702

They are the mainstay of effective asthma treatment, improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths. Studies have consistently shown that these agents reduce pathological signs of airway inflammation, so that lung function and symptoms improve, bronchial hyperresponsiveness decreases, and the frequency and severity of exacerbations are reduced. Corticosteroids interrupt the signaling pathways for pro-inflammatory molecules by decreasing the expression of genes for a variety of inflammatory mediators and by increasing the expression of genes for anti-inflammatory mediators.",181,41,0.2265193370165746

They include SABAs, LABAs with a rapid onset of action, short-acting theophylline and short-acting anticholinergic agents. The most effective forms are those that are delivered by inhalation directly to the airways. Short-acting beta -agonists. Inhaled SABAs, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, are used to control bronchoconstriction, and are the treatment of choice for the management of acute exacerbations and the prophylaxis of exercise-induced asthma. Oral preparations are also available and may be suitable for patients who are unable to use inhaled medication. In general, oral administration is less desirable than inhaled administration because systemic side effects such as tachycardia are more pronounced when the drug is delivered orally. Concern has been expressed over the long-term safety of repeatedly inhaling short-acting beta -bronchodilators. Several points are worth making in relation to the use of these quick relievers. They are certainly the best drugs for relieving acute bronchospasm and associated symptoms, but their increased use by a patient is a sign of worsening asthma and the need for greater use of controller (preventer) drugs. The use of one canister of a metered-dose inhaler per month should certainly sound alarm bells. Regular use of SABAs is not recommended, as a refractory response may develop, and it has been suggested that asthma may worsen. In addition, it is now known that genetic beta -adrenoceptor polymorphisms influence the effectiveness of these drugs, particularly with regard to tachyphylaxis or the development of refractoriness; therefore SABAs should only be used for quick relief on an 'as-required' basis.",398,57,0.14321608040201006

As asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening and are inevitably disruptive to patients and their carers, in these instances prevention of exacerbations should be the major focus of treatment. Factors indicating a high risk for future exacerbations include a past history of severe or life-threatening asthma attack, exacerbation occurring despite adequate preventative treatment, impaired interval lung function and cigarette smoke exposure. Current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma treatment, depending on disease control (Table 4.5), in both adults and children (Figure 4.6).

Routinely, the substitution of a spacer device with an MDI can improve medication delivery and consequently asthma control. A further consideration is in those with low lung function and consequent poor inspiratory flows who may not reach required inspiratory flow to achieve drug deposition with dry powder devices. So the first step in uncontrolled or poorly controlled asthma is the assessment of medication use and adherence. For the majority of individuals with uncontrolled asthma this will rectify the problem. In some instances measurement of blood corticosteroid levels can be performed, or dose counters used to formally assess adherence to medications where this is in doubt.",197,17,0.08629441624365482

Physical examination may point to a different pulmonary abnormality such as interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension. In these instances chest imaging, such as an X-ray, CT scan or echocardiography may be relevant. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a condition that complicates severe asthma due to airway colonization by fungi, leading to an exuberant immunologic response.

Cellular analysis of induced sputum can enable the diagnosis of eosinophilic airway inflammation which is much more likely to respond to corticosteroid treatments than a predominantly neutrophilic, or non-inflammatory sputum inflammatory pattern. Exhaled nitric oxide measurements may also be useful for the determination of the nature of airway inflammation, guiding further treatment options (see page 44).

A major indicator of risk for emergency asthma attendance is previous emergency attendance, indicating that preventive strategies should be applied for such individuals to prevent future severe and even life-threatening episodes. Fear of acute severe asthma is a major burden for many who live with severe asthma, and is a further reason for taking steps to prevent severe attacks. Any patient with asthma can suffer from an acute asthma episode, often described as an asthma attack. Viral respiratory infections are the most common cause, accounting for at least 50% of hospital admissions for asthma in adults and over 80% in children.

These forms of diabetes result from mutations affecting the genes that regulate beta cell function. They are commonly referred to as maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY), though the more correct name is monogenic diabetes. It is important to consider these forms of diabetes, as their treatment requirements can differ and they can be misclassified as type 1 or 2 diabetes. Monogenic diabetes is generally characterized by the onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (under 25 years) without ketoacidosis. The family history is usually positive for diabetes in two to three generations, which should raise the suspicion. Other suggestive features include the absence of autoantigens such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) or islet cell antibodies and detectable C-peptide. The lack of signs suggestive of insulin resistance - obesity, acanthosis nigricans and polycystic ovary syndrome - should also raise suspicion. Monogenic diabetes can be distinguished into types detected at birth and types detected later in life. About 10-15% of children diagnosed with diabetes are negative for autoantibodies.

New vessels are photocoagulated and, in cases of more severe proliferative retinopathy, panretinal photocoagulation is performed (id est laser burns to the entire retina, sparing the central macular area). The strategy for treating macular edema depends on the type and extent of vessel leakage. With focal leakage, microaneurysms are treated directly with laser photocoagulation. With non-specific foci of leakage, a grid of laser burns is applied. Photocoagulation aims to destroy hypoxic retinal tissue and may decrease the overproduction of vasoactive factors such as VEGF. Vitrectomy may be necessary to treat vitreous hemorrhage that fails to resolve spontaneously. Anti-VEGF agents. VEGF has been identified as having a major role in the genesis of diabetic retinopathy, and many ophthalmologists use intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents to treat diabetic macular edema based on their success in the treatment of age-related macular edema.

In patients with type 2 diabetes the prevalence is highly variable, ranging from 5% to 20%. Nephropathy is frequently associated with the development of type 1 diabetes before the age of 15 years. The incidence of nephropathy peaks after 10-20 years of type 1 diabetes and declines thereafter, suggesting a possible genetic predisposition to this complication.

Dietary protein restriction (0.3-0.8 g/kg/day) has also been shown to have a beneficial effect, though is difficult to maintain. In the presence of hypertension, vigorous blood pressure reduction attenuates the decline in renal function and delays progression to end-stage renal failure. A target blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg is usual. Antihypertensive therapy irrespective of the agent used will slow the development of diabetic nephropathy; however, the use of ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure has been associated with superior clinical benefit in this context, probably because ACE inhibitors reduce intraglomerular capillary pressure, leading to a reduction in proteinuria. Treatment with ACE inhibitors also delays the development of diabetic nephropathy in patients with microalbuminuria.

Diabetes is associated with a two- to fourfold increase in the risk of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral-limb ischemia (Figure 9.14). Diabetic patients, particularly women, have an increased risk of dying from coronary artery disease and an increased mortality from peripheral vascular disease. Of all lower-limb amputations, 50% are performed on diabetic patients. Atherosclerosis is more severe and widespread in diabetic patients, and consequently coronary artery disease may present at a younger age than in the non-diabetic population. Diabetic patients have more multivessel disease of the coronary arteries. They also have an increase in left ventricular mass. While this may be partly related to the increased prevalence of hypertension in this population, diabetes appears to be an independent contributor to left ventricular mass.

Immediate treatment of any identifiable cause of the DKA should be undertaken without delay. Until recently, standard management of DKA focused on reducing blood glucose levels with insulin and intravenous fluids. There is still universal agreement that the initial cornerstone of treatment is fluid replacement and insulin administration. The intravascular volume should be expanded to correct a typical deficit of 100 mL/kg of water with intravenous isotonic saline, which will also improve renal perfusion. Infusion rates of 1 L per hour for the first hour, 1 L for the next 2 hours and 1 L over the next 4 hours are usually adequate except in those patients with profound hypovolemia and hypotension, who may need twice this amount (Table 11.3). If the initial systolic blood pressure is below 90 mmHg, 500 mL of normal saline should be given over 15 minutes. In the presence of significant hypernatremia, isotonic saline can be replaced with 0.45% saline. The aim is to replace total body deficits of water and electrolytes, with half the estimated deficit being replaced in 12-24 hours (see Table 11.3).

The risk is particularly high when oral contraceptives are taken before the first full-term pregnancy. Although the incidence of breast cancer was increased in oral contraceptive users, mortality from the disease remained constant because the cancers tended to be of a more favorable type.

Neither BRCA1 nor BRCA2 should be considered 'breast-cancer specific' in the sense that a single mutation leads directly to disease, as in sickle-cell disease, for example. Both genes represent large segments on specific chromosomes where a number of deviations from the base sequence of DNA in the normal population are concentrated.

Discharges may also occur during early pregnancy, after breastfeeding and during treatment with certain drugs, such as oral contraceptives, some antihypertensive agents and some antidepressants. Persistent discharge from a single duct in the nipple needs to be investigated, especially if a dipstick is positive for blood.

Although this approach does appear to lead to the detection of smaller tumors, there is no evidence that it improves long-term survival. Indeed, two large-scale randomized controlled trials performed in St Petersburg and China found no difference in breast cancer mortality rates between women trained in breast self-examination and a control group. In these trials, compliance with the instructions was very high and could not be the reason for the absence of benefit. An adverse effect of self-examination training was the disproportionate number of women presenting with lumpy breasts who were then subjected to futile biopsies. The self-examination approach also has a potential problem in that random biopsies among premenopausal women may disclose ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ, the natural history of which is unknown.

Intraoperative radiotherapy is being tested in an attempt to reduce the risk of a cancer in the retained nipple and early results are encouraging.

In terms of local control, however, there may be little to choose between the success of surgery and the success of radiotherapy, balanced against the relatively rare, but significant, morbidity of either approach.

The absolute benefit for an individual woman depends on her initial risk.,"Tamoxifen was developed as a fertility drug in the 1970s and has subsequently become the mainstay of treatment for breast cancer. Treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years reduces the relative risk of dying from breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women (see below). Tamoxifen works as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and has effects both as an estrogen agonist and antagonist depending on the tissue and receptor type. Mechanism of action. In breast tissue, tamoxifen blocks the peripheral actions of estrogen (Figure 6.1). Tamoxifen binds competitively with 17-b-estradiol at the receptor site, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen, causing cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Tamoxifen is a prodrug, which is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2 D6 and CYP3a4 into active metabolites, such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen, which have 30-100 times greater affinity for the ER than tamoxifen itself.",242,36,0.1487603305785124

This should be performed for all patients complaining of blurred vision, flashes, floaters or visual field loss. Dim the room lights and use a bright light source (such as a bright flashlight or an ophthalmoscope); ask the patient to stare at a distant target and swing the light repeatedly but slowly between the two eyes, shining it for 1-2 seconds in each eye. A normal response is for each pupil to constrict when the light is shone on each eye in turn. An RAPD (the abnormal response) occurs when one pupil dilates, rather than constricts, when the light is shone on it.

Patients who exhibit 'normal fundoscopy' with the direct ophthalmoscope can still have serious disease that is detectable only by examination with the slit-lamp microscope and retinal lenses.","Optic discs, retinal blood vessels and macula. Move close to the patient and view the optic disc in each eye, noting whether the disc looks normal or abnormal (Figure 1.7); trace the retinal blood vessels away from the disc. View as much of the peripheral retina as possible by asking the patient to look up, down, right and left in turn. Finally, ask the patient to look directly at the light to view the macula. It is important to remember to examine the optic discs by direct ophthalmoscopy in all patients complaining of headache to see if bilateral disc swelling caused by raised intracranial pressure (papilledema) is present. Remember that although the direct ophthalmoscope gives good images of the optic discs it has only a very small field of view; a 'normal' direct ophthalmoscope examination therefore does not exclude the possibility of serious intraocular disease. It is sometimes difficult to identify subtle optic nerve swelling through the ophthalmoscope because you are viewing the image with only one eye. Depth perception and optic nerve swelling is better appreciated when viewing with both eyes (binocular viewing), such as when using a table-mounted slit-lamp. Slit-lamp examination is required to determine whether an eye is definitely 'normal'. A slit-lamp microscope provides a highly magnified three-dimensional view of the eye surface, anterior chamber, lens and, with handheld fundus lenses, the vitreous, retina and optic disc (Figure 1.8).

Corneal examination with fluorescein and blue light will usually reveal the ulcer by staining. Causes may be infective (viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan) or non-infective. These patients require urgent (same day) referral to an ophthalmologist. Be aware that a dendritic corneal ulcer, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), may present as a gritty eye rather than a red painful eye, because the virus makes the cornea partially numb. However, the patient will often complain of blurred vision and will have mildly reduced visual acuity; corneal examination with fluorescein and blue light will usually reveal the typical branch-like ulcer. Do not prescribe steroid drops for this condition. Dry eye may cause a slightly red eye, or the patient may have normal-looking eyes. Corneal abnormalities caused by dry eye are only visible on slit-lamp examination. Dry eye should be suspected if the patient complains that their eyes feel 'dry' or 'burning', or if the sensation worsens during reading (due to the decreased blink rate we all have while reading). Prescribe artificial tears to be administered frequently (every 2 hours) and then reduce the frequency as the symptoms improve. If the eyes are uncomfortable or 'stuck down' on waking, a lubricating ointment at night as well as drops during the day can help. Refer routinely if the eye drops do not help. Blepharitis is a chronic inflammation of the eyelid margins (often with crusting at the base of the lashes and redness of the lid margins) that can occur at any age.

The second most common cause of unequal pupil size is previous iritis, trauma or operation. Mechanical damage to the iris caused by these events may result in a pupil that is smaller or larger than normal, or that has a distorted rather than circular shape. Third nerve palsy. It is very rare for partial third nerve palsy from a tumor or aneurysm to cause an enlarged pupil in isolation (without double vision, ptosis or a visible abnormality of eye movement). The presence of an enlarged pupil in a patient with double vision from partial third nerve palsy indicates a high risk of serious underlying disease such as nerve compression by a posterior communicating artery aneurysm.

Horner's syndrome is the combination of miosis (a smaller than usual pupil), slight ptosis (a drooping upper lid) and hemifacial anhidrosis (absence of sweating) on the affected side of the face (Figure 7.5). These signs can be subtle and easily missed. Horner's syndrome occurs as a result of damage to the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye and eyelid; it may be caused by disease in the brainstem, cervical spinal cord, brachial plexus, lung apex, neck, base of skull or cavernous sinus. Such diseases include internal carotid artery dissection (spontaneous or following head or neck trauma), apical lung tumor (Pancoast syndrome) and tumors of the brain, skull base or neck; however, in many cases no cause is identified. Adie's tonic pupil is a benign condition in which one pupil is enlarged (rarely both pupils), without ptosis or diplopia. Patients may complain of blurred vision, because they lose the ability to focus on near objects. The affected pupil shows sluggish or absent constriction to a bright light, but still constricts slowly when the patient is asked to focus on a near object (known as light-near dissociation). The patient may also have depressed limb tendon reflexes of unknown cause (Holmes-Adie syndrome). Dilating eye drops are a common cause of abnormal sized pupils.

Patients with entropion should be referred urgently if a corneal abrasion or ulcer is present; otherwise prompt referral for corrective surgery is appropriate. Seventh nerve palsy, whether idiopathic or of known cause (tumor, infection, inflammation, traumatic, postsurgical), can result in decreased orbicularis muscle function and poor eyelid closure (Figure 9.6). Patients with seventh nerve palsy need to be seen urgently by an ophthalmologist (not referred routinely), as all patients with poor lid closure are at high risk of developing an exposure corneal ulcer.

A critical difference between childhood and adult vision is that children less than 9 years old with poor vision in one or both eyes from any cause, or one eye constantly turned from squint, will not develop normal connections between the affected eye/s and the developing visual cortex. This poor connection will result in permanent poor vision from amblyopia, even if the original eye problem is later corrected. If, however, the cause of poor vision (exempli gratia congenital cataract) is identified and treated urgently, permanent blindness from amblyopia may be prevented. The earlier a child with poor vision in one or both eyes is referred to an ophthalmologist, the better the chance of preventing permanent visual loss. In the case of a squint, amblyopia may often be partially or fully corrected by patching the 'good' eye under close ophthalmic supervision. For these reasons, the ophthalmic assessment of children with poor vision is a matter of some urgency. Abnormal red reflex or 'white pupil'. The normal red reflex seen with a direct ophthalmoscope in a dark room is a diffuse orange or red glow from both pupils. Do not forget that you see the red reflex by looking though the direct ophthalmoscope a few feet away from the patient. You can check both red reflexes at the same time in the same field of view because of this distance from the patient. This also allows a direct comparison of the red reflex in both eyes at the same time. A red reflex test should be performed on any child with a squint, apparently poor vision or any other eye problem. If the red reflex on one or both sides is abnormal (Figure 10.1), a serious intraocular abnormality such as congenital cataract (dull or absent red reflex) or retinoblastoma (white reflex) is likely.

Penetrating eye injury. It is important to suspect a penetrating injury in any patient with a suggestive history such as hammering metal, which may, for example, cause a high velocity small fragment of metal to penetrate the eye. Even if the eye looks normal on examination, you must refer the patient urgently to an ophthalmologist because of the risk of intraocular infection or retinal toxicity to a metallic intraocular foreign body. Direct trauma with a sharp object may lacerate the cornea or sclera (Figure 11.1). Ocular structures are often damaged at the time, but there is also a high risk of intraocular infection that can cause blindness and loss of the eye within days. Injuries range from the eye being struck with the sharp tip of a palm frond while gardening, which may result in an eye with normal vision that has a barely visible corneal laceration, to a patient whose eye has been severely lacerated with broken glass. Warning symptoms and signs (which are not always present) to watch out for include. eye pain, photophobia (sensitivity to light), blurred vision, floaters or field loss after a suspicious-sounding injury. a distorted pupil (teardrop shape with the point due to iris prolapse at the site of penetration). hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber). Telephone an ophthalmologist immediately if you suspect your patient has a penetrating eye injury. Intraocular foreign body is most commonly caused by a small piece of high-speed metal striking the eye, often in metalworkers whilst hammering. You need to maintain a high index of suspicion even if the eye looks normal to you and even if you find a corneal foreign body, as a second piece of metal could be inside the eye. An urgent slit-lamp examination and X-ray of the orbit should be carried out in any patient who says they have been hit in the eye with a high-speed fragment. If an intraocular foreign body is not detected and surgically removed early, loss of the eye through infection, toxicity or retinal detachment can occur. Hammering metal is the classic cause of an intraocular foreign body; fragments from grinding metal more commonly result in superficial corneal foreign bodies. Ruptured globe. Severe blunt trauma may split the sclera open, but because the overlying conjunctiva may remain intact this type of injury is often not directly visible on examination. The patient usually complains of severe pain, blurred vision and often floaters (due to vitreous hemorrhage) or field loss (due to retinal detachment). Intraocular pressure is often low. Hyphema is blood in the anterior chamber (between the cornea and the iris) (Figure 11.2). Hyphema may be seen after blunt trauma that has caused no other damage to the eye, or it may be a sign of penetrating eye injury, intraocular foreign body or ruptured globe. The major risk to sight after isolated hyphema (with no other eye damage) is high intraocular pressure, which can cause damage to the optic nerve head or retinal vascular occlusion. Permanent corneal blood staining can also occur with high eye pressure. Orbital fracture. The most common fracture is an orbital floor 'blowout' fracture, which is often seen on an X-ray or CT scan as a fluid level in the maxillary sinus, or as soft tissue protruding into the sinus from the orbital floor (Figure 11.3). Air in the orbit may also be seen. This injury should be suspected in any patient with blunt facial trauma who admits to double vision or a numb cheek or numb upper teeth on the side of the injury. They should be advised to not blow their nose after the injury as air can pass into the soft tissues. Chemical burn by acid, alkali (strong alkalis in particular) or other substances such as snake venom may cause devastating damage to the eye. Alkali disrupts cell membranes allowing ease of penetration of the alkali into the eye. Acid-coagulated protein can sometimes provide a barrier to further penetration of acid. Acid and alkali burns can, however, often result in blindness or loss of the eye. It may help the ophthalmologist if the patient brings along information about the substance that may have entered the eye (substance name and chemical classification, or a sealed container of the substance), but obtaining such information should not in any way delay immediate and prolonged irrigation of the eye. Mild chemical burns are more common (exempli gratia from shampoo, washing detergent and so on); these cause mild discomfort but are not dangerous.",973,238,0.2446043165467626

Immuno-deficiency states are the most obvious examples of a relatively uncommon risk factor that carries a high relative risk. It has been suggested that the rising incidence of lymphoma during the 1980s and 1990s reflected an increasing incidence of immunodeficiency, most obviously due to the emergence of HIV and AIDS. Indeed, HIV/AIDS has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of lymphoma, but it accounts for less than 50% of the increase in incidence seen in the West.

The earliest recognizable cell in the B-cell lineage is called the pro-B cell. This matures to produce the pre-B cell, which expresses immunoglobulin internally within the cytoplasm (along with a receptor on the surface called the pre-B-cell receptor). This in turn develops into the immature B cell, which expresses intact immunoglobulin (IgM or IgD) on the surface of the cell. The main molecular event during the antigen-independent phase is rearrangement of the heavy- and light-chain genes that code for the immunoglobulin receptor, thereby generating a vast range of B-cell receptors capable of recognizing large numbers of new antigens. B cells then travel via the bloodstream to the spleen where they undergo further development (in the form of transitional B cells) to result in mature (though still antigen naive) B cells.",206,39,0.18932038834951456

Cancer can, therefore, be considered a genetic disease. This does not mean it is hereditary, but rather is due to the accumulation of a number of acquired genetic changes that cause the transformation of a normal cell into a malignant cell. The genetic changes result in either over- or underexpression of the genes involved.

This antibody is linked to a fluorescent marker, which will emit light if it is bound to the cell when it passes through the flow cytometer. The strength of the emitted light is measured by a detector, which then provides information about the relative amount of antigen expressed on the cell surface. More than one protein can be assessed at the same time, as different antibodies can be linked to markers emitting light of different frequencies.

This group of lymphomas is likely to represent several different entities with distinct epidemiological and etiologic factors. They may also confer a different prognosis to the patient; there is emerging evidence that different subtypes of DLBCL use different signaling pathways and that patients may therefore benefit from different targeted therapies according to their 'molecular subtype'. Expression microarray studies have identified two major groups of DLBCL, which are associated with different outcomes. The first group has a gene-expression signature that suggests the cells have originated from a germinal-center B cell (see page 19). This group is therefore called germinal-center B-cell (GCB) type and has a relatively good 5-year survival rate. The second group is rather more heterogeneous and is often termed the activated B-cell (ABC) type. These lymphomas have a significantly worse 5-year survival rate.",213,30,0.14084507042253522

However, there is extensive evidence to show that the survival for patients with indolent lymphomas has improved in the last two decades, possibly because of the introduction of monoclonal antibody therapy. In view of this, the treatment paradigm for patients with indolent lymphomas is changing. Historically, treatment was considered palliative, aimed at reducing symptoms and preventing critical organ failure (see Chapter 6). It was entirely reasonable to monitor the patient (often known as active surveillance) and to intervene only when symptoms appeared. This approach is still widely used and still appropriate for many patients with indolent lymphoma, especially those who are elderly or who have major comorbidities that limit the use of chemotherapy. For younger fitter patients, the advent of new therapies has improved survival and a more active approach to therapy is typical for these patients now (see below). Single-agent oral chemotherapy, for example with an alkylating agent, can be effective in inducing a partial response and thereby improves the patient's symptoms and general wellbeing. Combination chemotherapy with rituximab will induce a higher response rate and a higher complete remission rate, which appears to translate into increased overall survival.",265,17,0.06415094339622641

The use of PET scans in 'standard of care' management is still unclear. Some studies have suggested that PET scanning after a few cycles of chemotherapy can predict the likely result of treatment - patients whose PET scan is positive after one or two cycles of chemotherapy appear to have a poorer prognosis than those with a negative scan.

Until relatively recently, early-stage disease was treated with extended-field radiotherapy alone. However, such treatment was associated with a significant relapse rate and serious late toxicities. In particular, it was noted that second cancers could develop within the radiotherapy field. This was especially marked in women who had irradiation involving the breasts and in smokers who had irradiation involving the lungs. The other major long-term toxicity was found to be coronary heart disease in patients who had radiotherapy involving the heart. Most centers now treat favorable disease with two to four cycles of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD), followed by radiotherapy to only those areas directly affected by the disease (involved-field or involved-site radiotherapy). Trials are ongoing as to whether it is safe to omit the radiotherapy entirely in patients who respond very well to chemotherapy as judged by a negative PET scan after two or three courses of ABVD.",188,29,0.15425531914893617

These effects are minimized by using fractions (which also increases efficacy) and by careful planning.,"External-beam radiotherapy is by far the most common radiotherapy for lymphomas. Careful planning is essential for safety. The aim is to ensure that the entire target area is included in the radiation field, while normal organs receive as little radiation as possible. To achieve this, several X-ray, CT and MRI studies are usually carried out. The patient is then put into a simulator, which is almost identical to the radiotherapy machine but does not actually deliver therapy. Information from the scans and from the simulator is then used to calculate the optimum radiation field, and the number and direction of the beams. To ensure that the radiation is delivered to exactly the same place every time, very small tattoos are made on the patient's skin, which act as landmarks for the radiographers. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) involves the use of multiple beams to limit the dose of radiotherapy to normal tissue.

The most commonly used monoclonal antibody is rituximab, which binds to the CD20 molecule. CD20 is found on normal B lymphocytes and many types of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). When rituximab binds to target cells, it sensitizes them to chemotherapy and recruits components of the immune system (Figure 10.5). Rituximab has been shown to be effective in both high- and low-grade B-cell NHL. It also has the advantage of having relatively few side effects, with the most problematic being fever and chills during the initial infusion.

9781908541796,chapter10,"The treatment of lymphoma often involves multiple modalities: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and/or high-dose therapy with stem-cell support.","In general, the higher the dose of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the greater the number of lymphoma cells that is destroyed. However, it is also true that the higher the dose, the worse the side effects. The major dose-limiting side effect is bone-marrow suppression. Although most forms of chemotherapy cause some degree of bone-marrow suppression, this usually lasts for only a few days. With high doses, however, significant anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia can last for weeks or months. The main risk during this time is overwhelming infection with bacteria or fungi. To reduce the duration of marrow failure with high doses of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, stem cells can be infused into the bloodstream 1 or 2 days after the completion of treatment. Stem cells previously obtained from the bone marrow (called hematopoietic stem cells) have the ability to return to the bone marrow, grow, divide and produce all the cellular constituents of the blood.

The most common indications (Table 10.4) are relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and certain types of NHL (id est in second or subsequent remissions). As the success of an autograft relies on the action of chemotherapy, it is important to determine whether the lymphoma is still chemosensitive. Transplantation in chemoresistant disease is generally unsuccessful. For the transplant procedure (Figure 10.6), patients first receive high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. This is followed 1 or 2 days after the last dose of treatment by infusion of the stem cells in a process similar to a blood transfusion. About 2-4 days after the stem cell infusion, the patient's blood counts drop and an infection often develops.

The neurological examination should focus on the level of patient alertness and any evidence of stroke. Patients with ACS frequently exhibit anxiety and restlessness, diaphoresis and skin pallor. The patient may have a variable heart rate, depending on the degree of anxiety, concomitant arrhythmias and hemodynamic compromise. Body temperature is likely to be normal in patients with UA but elevated during MI. Respiratory rate may be normal or elevated because of pain, anxiety or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. An abnormal cardiac examination will be observed more often in patients with MI than in those with UA. A resting 12-lead ECG should be performed and reviewed by an experienced clinician in all patients with suspected ACS within 10 minutes of first medical contact. If the likelihood of ACS is high but the 12-lead ECG is normal, a 17-lead ECG may be performed to reveal 'true posterior' STEMI (usually caused by occlusion of the circumflex artery or upper marginal branch of the circumflex artery). Without this, 8-10% of STEMIs may be misdiagnosed as NSTEMIs. Since ECGs provide only a 'snap shot' of myocardial ischemia, continuous monitoring and serial ECG tracings are recommended. Continuous monitoring provides vital information about arrhythmias or the development of recurrent ischemia. European (ESC) guidelines recommend that an ECG should be recorded at least 6 and 24 hours after presentation and if/when symptoms recur. It is important to compare current and previous ECG findings, as patients with no ECG changes have a lower risk of complications than those with ECG changes.",411,92,0.22384428223844283

Clinical validated risk-stratification models such as the TIMI or GRACE risk scores are useful for assisting in management strategies and timing of invasive treatment in patients with suspected ACS.,"The GRACE risk score. In the GRACE risk model, eight variables are used to predict whether a patient will die or have a MI in the hospital or in the next 6 months. Each variable is assigned a numeric score on the basis of a specific value, and the eight scores are added to yield a total score, which is applied to a reference nomogram to determine the patient's risk (www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/acs_risk/acs_risk_content.html, last accessed 04 November 2013). GRACE uses variables derived from a registry of consecutive ACS patients, rather than patients in randomized trials (as in other scores) with specific inclusion-exclusion criteria. GRACE also includes renal function as a variable, since this is known to influence long-term prognosis. Application of risk scores. Ischemic risk scores assist risk stratification at the time of hospital admission, help to identify patients suitable for early invasive management and predict short- and long-term adverse cardiac events.

Percutaneous coronary intervention. The majority of PCIs are performed with the implantation of a stent(s) (Figure 3.1). The procedure. During PCI, access into the femoral artery in the leg (or the radial artery or brachial artery in the arm) is created by a device called an 'introducer needle'. Once access is gained, a sheath is placed in the opening to keep the artery open and control bleeding. A long, flexible, soft plastic tube called a guiding catheter is advanced through the sheath over a guidewire. The tip of the guiding catheter is placed at the origin of the coronary artery. The guiding catheter also allows for iodine-based radiopaque dyes to be injected into the coronary artery, so that lesion location and severity can be precisely assessed using real-time radiographic visualization. This enables the cardiologist to estimate the size of the coronary artery and select the type of balloon catheter and coronary guidewire to use. A heparin or direct thrombin inhibitor is given to prevent clotting and maintain blood flow. A coronary guidewire, which is an extremely thin wire with a radiopaque flexible tip, is then inserted through the guiding catheter and into the coronary artery. Still using real-time radiographic visualization, the wire is guided through the coronary artery to the site of the stenosis or blockage. The tip of the wire is then passed across the blockage. The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guidewire by gently twisting the end that sits outside the patient.",396,33,0.08333333333333333

Occasionally, vitamin K deficiency and liver disease coincide. With cholestatic liver disorders, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis, the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin K can be impaired.

Studies have shown that the improvement in acne achieved with oral antibiotics plus a topical retinoid or retinoid/benzoyl peroxide (BPO) fixed combination can be maintained with continued use of the topical retinoid or retinoid/BPO combination after the antibiotic is discontinued.,"Oral antibiotics. Second-generation tetracycline antibiotics (see pages 59-64) should be the systemic treatment of choice for those patients who can tolerate them. Second-generation tetracyclines are absorbed more rapidly, are more rapidly efficacious and achieve better adherence than first-generation tetracyclines. They are usually administered as capsules. If minocycline is used (not as first-line treatment, see pages 61-2), it is available as aqueous film-coated tablets. Patients who crush their tablets because they are unable to swallow entire pills may not absorb an adequate amount of antibiotic. Minocycline is thought to be associated with the lowest incidence of P. acnes resistance but development of resistance to oral tetracyclines is a potential problem in patients with acne. Resistance should be suspected if a patient's acne fails to respond, or improves then worsens after 3 months of treatment. In such cases, an alternative agent should be chosen. Erythromycin is now used only as a substitute for tetracyclines in women who 'may become' pregnant. The third-line treatment is oral trimethoprim (see page 65). Maintenance therapy. Global overutilization of antibiotics and the resulting emergence of antibacterial resistance (see pages 91-3) have led to calls to limit the use of oral antibiotics in acne treatments. Three well-designed trials indicate that the benefit achieved with a 12-week course of antibiotics plus a retinoid or retinoid/BPO fixed combination can be maintained with continued use of the retinoid or retinoid/BPO combination after the course of antibiotics. This approach limits the long-term use of antibiotics, thus minimizing the ongoing selective pressure for development of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Since microcomedones are thought to be the precursor lesions of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne, a topical retinoid regimen aimed at reducing microcomedones may be useful as maintenance therapy following treatment with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin (see below).",423,91,0.21513002364066194

Current concepts suggest that inflammation induced by cigarette smoke underlies most pathological lesions associated with COPD. The inflammation damages lung structures, and individuals who are unable to repair this damage develop tissue alterations and functional compromise. Inflammation also contributes to recurrent exacerbations of COPD, in which acute inflammation is superimposed on the chronic disease. There is now good evidence that all smokers develop lung inflammation; however, some individuals are more susceptible to the effects of cigarette smoke and are more severely affected. The pathogenesis of COPD in non-smokers has not been studied as much, but inflammation secondary to air pollution or other substances is likely to play a key role.

This chronic hypersecretion of mucus results from changes in the central airways - the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles over 2-4 mm in internal diameter. Mucus is produced by mucus glands, which are present mainly in the larger airways, and by goblet cells, found in the airway epithelium (see Figure 1.1). In chronic bronchitis, hypertrophy of mucus glands, mainly in the larger bronchi, is associated with infiltration of the glands by inflammatory cells (Figure 1.2). In healthy never-smokers, goblet cells make up 10% of the columnar epithelial cells in the proximal airways, but their numbers decrease in more distal airways and are normally absent in the terminal or respiratory bronchioles. In smokers, however, goblet cells are not only present in increased numbers but also extend more peripherally. Metaplastic or dysplastic changes in the surface epithelium may replace the goblet cells of the normal respiratory epithelium in some smokers and thus may reduce the number of goblet cells in the proximal airways.

Eosinophils may not be prominent in severe exacerbations. Several studies using bronchoalveolar lavage, spontaneous or induced sputum, have demonstrated intraluminal inflammation in the airspaces of patients with chronic bronchitis with or without airway obstruction. In stable chronic bronchitis, the high percentage of intraluminal neutrophils is associated with the presence of neutrophil chemotactic factors, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) and leukotriene B4, and other inflammatory mediators. There is also evidence that the airspace inflammation in patients with chronic bronchitis persists following smoking cessation if the production of sputum persists, though cough and sputum are reduced in most smokers who quit.

9781910797006,ch01,"Inflammation occurs in large and small airways, and in the alveolar space, most commonly involving a number of cells including neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ lymphocytes.","The smaller bronchi and bronchioles less than 2 mm in diameter are a major site of airway obstruction in COPD. Inflammation in the small airways is one of the earliest changes in asymptomatic cigarette smokers, and considerable changes in these airways can occur without giving rise to symptoms or alteration in spirometry measurements. Thus, this region in the lung has been referred to as the 'silent zone', as abnormalities are not easily detected by conventional pulmonary function testing. The pattern of inflammatory cell changes in the small airways resembles that in the larger airways, including a predominance of CD8+ lymphocytes and an increase in the CD8:CD4 ratio. The mechanisms leading to the increase in peripheral airway resistance include several distinct processes: destruction of alveolar support, loss of elastic recoil in the parenchyma that contributes to this support and provides driving pressure for alveolar emptying, and structural narrowing of the airway lumen. The lumen may be occluded by mucus and cells. Mucosal ulceration, goblet cell hyperplasia and squamous cell metaplasia may be present in addition to fibrosis and mesenchymal cell accumulation. As the condition progresses, structural remodeling may occur, characterized by increased collagen content and formation of scar tissue, which narrows the airways and produces fixed airway obstruction (Figure 1.3).

The association with cigarette smoking is certainly clearer for centriacinar than panacinar emphysema, though smokers can develop both types. Those with centriacinar emphysema appear to have more abnormalities in their small airways than those with predominantly panacinar emphysema.

In around 20% of cases the surrounding lung is normal, but most bullae are associated with more generalized emphysema and chronic airway obstruction. Pulmonary vasculature. The vasculature of the lung may be affected in several ways. The development of chronic alveolar hypoxia in patients with COPD results in hypoxic vasoconstriction of the small pulmonary arteries and, consequently, an inflammatory response in the arteries similar to that in the lungs. This leads to remodeling of the pulmonary arteries. As a result, early in COPD the intima may become thickened, followed by an increase in the amount of smooth muscle and infiltration of the vessel wall with inflammatory cells. As the disease progresses, the amounts of smooth muscle, proteoglycans and collagen present in the vessel wall increase and cause it to thicken. Right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension are common in patients with advanced COPD who have chronic hypoxemia. Functional compromise of the pulmonary circulation can also be caused by dynamic hyperinflation, which increases intrathoracic pressure, restricts blood flow and may contribute to impaired diastolic filling of the heart.",338,53,0.15680473372781065

The mechanisms by which cigarette smoke leads to COPD are under intensive study, as they offer potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Smoke is capable of inducing an inflammatory response through a number of mechanisms. It induces release of proinflammatory mediators from epithelial cells present in the lower respiratory tract, as well as from resident macrophages. It can also activate complement. Thus, the inflammation that is characteristically present in the lungs of smokers probably results from activation of multiple pathways. The mediators released by inflammatory cells and parenchymal cells recruited and stimulated by cigarette smoke are capable of inducing lung damage. These mediators include reactive oxygen species, active proteinases and toxic peptides. In addition, cigarette smoke can decrease levels of antioxidants and antiproteinases that serve to mitigate damage caused by these toxic moieties. These effects therefore tip the balance in the lung toward tissue damage both by increasing the production of toxic mediators and by decreasing defenses.",195,33,0.16923076923076924

Additional genetic associations that may contribute to COPD risk and that are more common than alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency have been identified, although these are likely to increase the risk of COPD only modestly.

Breathlessness is the symptom that causes most disability and is associated with loss of lung function over time. In good health, the body meets the increased oxygen demand produced by exercise by using some of the inspiratory reserve volume of the lungs to increase tidal volume and by increasing respiratory rate (Figure 3.1). In COPD, because the expiratory airflow is reduced, the lungs empty slowly. As a result, the lungs become overinflated with air trapped in the alveoli, particularly when the respiratory rate increases. This hyperinflation compromises the use of the inspiratory reserve volume and breathlessness worsens. As the diaphragm flattens when the lungs are overinflated, the accessory muscles of respiration become increasingly important.

The most recent classification from the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) takes into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation (Figure 3.2). First, the patient's symptoms are assessed using the COPD assessment test (CAT) or the modified MRC score (mMRC) for dyspnea (see Table 3.2). The CAT is the preferred test as it provides a comprehensive assessment of symptoms (www.catestonline.org). A CAT score of 10 or more indicates a high level of symptoms. Exacerbation risk is then assessed in three ways: by the severity of airflow limitation as indicated by spirometry grade, with a GOLD classification of 3 or 4 indicating high risk (see Table 4.1); by the patient's history of exacerbations, with two or more exacerbations in the preceding year indicating high risk; and by the patient's history of hospitalization in the preceding year.

The use of a fixed FEV :FVC ratio as a diagnostic criterion for chronic airflow limitation is a pragmatic approach, as reference values for FEV :FVC are unavailable. However, the fixed ratio has limitations because the ratio declines with age, with the potential for overdiagnosis of COPD in the elderly. It also has the potential to underdiagnose disease in younger individuals. The lower limit of normal (LLN) is an alternative approach to the fixed ratio to determine the presence of COPD.

It is a simple, quick and inexpensive way of measuring airflow obstruction, and has been particularly useful for repeated measurements in patients with asthma to reveal spontaneous diurnal variation or variations in response to therapy. The PEF meter measures the maximal flow rate that can be maintained over 10 ms; it is most effective for monitoring changes in airflow in an individual over time, but should not be used in the diagnosis of COPD. In COPD, there is little daily change in PEF and many of the variations are often within the error range of the measurement. Although repeated measurements of PEF can replace measurement of FEV, single measurements are not as useful as the variation is so high. There are several theoretical reasons why FEV is a better measurement than PEF in the diagnosis and assessment of COPD (Table 4.3).

Many spirometers plot expiratory flow rate throughout the entire expiration at the same time as a standard volume-time trace. The PEF, which is sustained for 10 ms, represents the flow only in the larger airways. However, the flow-volume trace interprets flow from all generations of the airways and may be more helpful than PEF in detecting early airway narrowing in smaller airways (Figure 4.5). Expiratory flow rates at 75% or 50% of VC have been used as a measure of airflow limitation, and provide complementary information to that obtained from the usual volume-time plot. There are problems with the reproducibility of these measurements, so that values must fall below 50% of the predicted values to be considered abnormal. Flows at lung volumes below 50% of VC were previously considered to be an indicator of small-airways dysfunction, but probably provide no more clinically useful information than measurement of FEV.

Following inhalation of a small amount of carbon monoxide, some of the inhaled marker is transferred from the lungs into the pulmonary capillary blood where it binds to hemoglobin. Reductions in the concentration of carbon monoxide in the exhaled gas can therefore be used to gauge the efficiency of gas transfer within the lung. Some of the reduction in carbon monoxide level is also due to diffusion into the residual volume of the lung. Thus, values for the diffusing capacity in the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco; TLco in the UK) are generally corrected using helium, which diffuses into the residual volume but is not absorbed into the pulmonary capillary blood.

9781910797006,ch07,Optimum clinical benefits require an integrated program combining pulmonary rehabilitation with pharmacotherapy.,"Clinical monitoring. In view of the above, all patients with COPD should be treated initially and aggressively with bronchodilators to control symptoms. Their response should be monitored with objective measures of airflow and on the basis of clinical outcomes, such as symptoms and performance. Adequate assessment of clinical response may require exercise challenge. It is common for patients with COPD to restrict their level of activity progressively as the disease worsens. This reduces dyspnea, but at the cost of an increasingly sedentary existence. Treatment with bronchodilators alone is often insufficient to treat such patients. Usually, improvements in physiological function can benefit the patient only if the bronchodilator treatment is used together with an aggressive rehabilitation program (see pages 113 -). Thus, though bronchodilators form first-line therapy in COPD, for their use to be successful they must be integrated into an appropriate management plan, such as that suggested in the GOLD strategy document (see Table 7.2) or the COPD Foundation Guide (see Table 7.1).",216,15,0.06944444444444445

By relaxing vascular smooth muscle, they can increase blood flow to relatively poorly ventilated areas and may thus cause a reduction in oxygenation in some settings.

This decrease appears to be associated with a beneficial effect on health status (quality of life), which is reasonable, as COPD exacerbations are associated with a worsening in health status. Several large studies have demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in terms of both exacerbations and health status. The effect on exacerbations is generally due to the effect in the most severely affected patients who experience the most frequent exacerbations, although milder cases may also benefit.

In the UK, respiratory admissions account for 25% of all acute emergency admissions, and COPD accounts for more than half of these, representing more than 200 000 hospital admissions per year. Recent studies have suggested that up to 50% of patients do not report exacerbations, so the true frequency is much higher than the number of consultations with primary care physicians suggests. Thus, the healthcare burden imposed by exacerbations of COPD is enormous. Annual costs in the USA are estimated at nearly $29.5 billion and $20.4 billion in direct and indirect costs, respectively.

After a series of studies in the 1970s showed that clinicians varied widely in their diagnosis of schizophrenia (which was made twice as often in North America as in Europe), operational diagnostic criteria were developed, such as the Research Diagnostic Criteria of Endicott and Spitzer, initially for use in research to try to standardize diagnosis. This approach gives a menu of possible symptoms and specifies that a certain number should be present for a minimum duration before a diagnosis can be made. Current classification systems. The two main classification systems in use worldwide are the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (Tables 2.3 and 2.4). The ICD-10 is mainly used outside North America; ICD-11 is expected in 2017. In their definitions of schizophrenia, the two systems are similar.

Early surveys seemed to show that this was due to the drift of people into urban areas after the illness started, rather than to higher rates of new cases in cities. However, large studies have confirmed that new cases arise more commonly in cities, with the rates being proportional to the degree of urbanization. This appears to be an unexpectedly large effect. The relative risk for large-city dwellers compared with that for rural residents is only two- to threefold (see Table 5.2, page 44) but, because much of the population lives in cities, the proportion of schizophrenia that can be explained by this factor is about one-third. Being brought up in a city appears to be the critical factor, and the risk increases the more childhood years spent in an urban environment. The factors associated with city life that lead to this higher incidence remain to be clarified.

The consensus from population-based studies is that concordance rates are about 45% for MZ co-twins and 15% for DZ co-twins. The fact that concordance is less than 100% in MZ twins suggests that non-genetic, environmental factors are also involved.

The hypothesis was built on three observations. First was the recognition of a schizophrenia-like psychosis in people who misused amphetamine, a drug known to increase the release of dopamine. Second was the emergence of adverse effects of the recently discovered antipsychotic chlorpromazine, which mimicked Parkinson's disease, itself thought to be due to faulty dopamine transmission. Third was the observation that all effective antipsychotic agents were dopamine receptor antagonists. In the following 15 years, while several experiments provided compelling, but circumstantial, evidence in further support of the importance of the dopamine D receptor in schizophrenia, there remained known shortcomings in the dopamine hypothesis and a lack of direct evidence.

FGAs and SGAs are relatively effective for treating secondary negative symptoms, but leave untouched the primary avolitional syndrome described so eloquently by Kraepelin (see Chapter 1). The limited efficacy of antipsychotics has led to the investigation of alternative treatments for negative symptoms. Various approaches have been attempted based on specific neurochemical hypotheses of the pathophysiology of negative symptoms. One of the more frequently investigated strategies has been the use of agents that increase the level of activity of the N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor. As described in Chapter 8, this approach is based on the proposition that negative symptoms are due to decreased glutamatergic activity secondary to NMDA receptor hypofunction. Glycine, D-serine and D-cycloserine all bind to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor and are required for NMDA receptor response to glutamate. In pilot studies, these agents were shown to be effective in ameliorating persistent negative symptoms.

Traditionally, these symptoms were viewed, in the words of the psychiatrist and phenomenologist Karl Jaspers, as 'un-understandable'. Coupled with the failure of psychoanalytical treatments for schizophrenia in the 1950s and 1960s, this view left a legacy of skepticism about psychological approaches. Since the mid-1990s, however, randomized controlled trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective for persistent psychotic symptoms in chronic schizophrenia when given in addition to routine care (Case history 11.1). The effect size is about the same as that for clozapine.

It is a difficult-to-describe sick or queasy sensation, usually perceived as being in the stomach. Nausea and vomiting are not necessarily on a continuum. Although nausea may be considered a prodromal phase to the act of vomiting, patients may experience significant nausea without vomiting. Conversely, patients may have sudden emesis without nausea.

Vomiting is a reflex activated by toxic substances such as chemotherapy drugs, which may directly affect areas in the cerebral cortex and the medulla oblongata, or may stimulate the small intestine via the vagus nerve. Afferent impulses, triggered from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), pharynx and vagal afferent fibers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, then travel to the vomiting center (VC) - termed the 'central pattern generator' by some authors - in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla (Figure 1.1). The VC is the primary structure that coordinates the mechanisms of nausea and vomiting; it is sensitive to several neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, substance P), which are released through these pathways. Each individual may require a different level of stimulation to the VC to reach the threshold for nausea or vomiting, such that individuals will experience different responses to the same stimuli. The mechanism that is best supported by research involves an effect on the upper small intestine. When rapidly dividing enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract are damaged, serotonin is released and binds to vagal afferent receptors in the wall of the bowel that activate the VC and stimulate emesis either directly or indirectly through the CTZ.

A pre-specified exploratory logistic regression analysis, which adjusted for sex, region, age and use of AC-based chemotherapy confirmed the primary analysis. When analyzed by chemotherapy subgroups, treatment with rolapitant demonstrated significantly higher complete response rates than control treatment in the delayed phase in patients who received AC-based (66.9% vs 59.5%; p =0.05) and non-AC-based (76.1% vs 63.8%; p <=0.001) MEC.

Although dexamethasone is not approved as an antiemetic, it plays a significant role in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed CINV, and is an essential part of almost all antiemetic regimens in clinical practice. Safety and tolerability. Corticosteroids used in CINV as either monotherapy or in combination with other agents are very well tolerated. The most common side effects are transient elevations in glucose, insomnia, anxiety and gastric upset., In most settings, the duration of therapy with a corticosteroid is short and side effects can be managed, and the benefits are considered to offset any adverse effects. Uncommonly, these agents can decompensate diabetes, cause psychosis, or reactivate an ulcer.

High-intensity and sustained mass media campaigns and mass quitting events, such as Stoptober, have an important effect in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence. Banning tobacco marketing and bans on smoking in indoor public areas probably also play a role.","In countries such as the UK, smokers support these kinds of policies, presumably because they recognize that they can provide an added incentive to stop - which is what they mostly want to do. Taxation has to be linked to effective countermeasures against illicit supply. It is important to structure it to prevent tobacco companies using pricing policies to undermine its deterrent effect. Not all of the decrease in consumption involves smokers giving up altogether; in some cases smokers merely reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke. The health benefits of this action may be undermined, however, because smokers tend to smoke each cigarette more intensively. It is also not fully known how reductions in consumption translate into health benefits. Nevertheless, it is clear that increasing the cost of smoking is, potentially, an important public health measure. Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence. The size of the effect is related to the intensity of the campaign (as indexed by viewing numbers) and whether it is sustained. Specific quitting events, for example the UK's 'No Smoking Day' and 'Stoptober' (a mass quitting event that challenges smokers to be smoke-free for a month as a stepping stone to permanent cessation), and the US 'Great American Smokeout' (which encourages quitting for a day), have been evaluated as a highly cost-effective way of promoting smoking cessation.",272,64,0.23529411764705882

A second likely mechanism is the development of a kind of 'nicotine hunger'. Repeated intake of nicotine from cigarettes over a period of months or years changes the way that the pathway described above operates, so that if nicotine concentrations in the brain fall below a certain level, the activity in the pathway falls to abnormally low levels; this creates a kind of 'acquired drive', a hunger for nicotine, that is often experienced as craving.

It is important to remember that the gum is relatively harmless, and even if users continue to chew it for many years, the health effects would be minimal, and certainly far smaller than the effects of smoking. Nicotine lozenges are available in two formulations. One formulation from GlaxoSmithKline has been clinically proven and is available in 2 mg and 4 mg lozenges. Novartis market a 1 mg lozenge which is yet to undergo clinical trials. The nicotine is absorbed through the lining of the mouth, as it is from nicotine gum. The 2 mg and 4 mg lozenges deliver more nicotine than gum of the corresponding doses, because all the nicotine is released. The 4 mg lozenge has been tested only with more-dependent smokers (those who light up within 30 minutes of waking), while the 2 mg lozenge has been tested only with less-dependent smokers (those who first light up more than 30 minutes after waking). In both cases, the lozenges proved effective. The lozenges have also been shown to be effective in both light (<= 15 cigarettes per day; 2 mg lozenge) and heavy (>= 40 cigarettes per day; 4 mg lozenge) smokers.",499,73,0.1462925851703407

Ideally, clinicians should ask about smoking in a way that enables women to admit to it without fear of stigmatization, and behavioral support services should be made as accessible as possible. One approach is to ask whether the mother-to-be has recently stopped smoking, and to recommend behavioral support to new 'ex-smokers' as well as current smokers. Given the health gains if a pregnant smoker manages to stop, it would even be cost-effective to deliver behavioral support in the woman's own home. Importantly, even among women who stop during pregnancy, there is a very high risk of relapse after birth; accordingly, such women should be provided with behavioral support and, if necessary, pharmacological treatment to avoid relapse.

Lewy bodies in the remaining nigral neurons are a pathological hallmark of the disease after death.","The confusion regarding mortality in Parkinson's disease may be partly because the disease itself is not a primary or direct cause of death. In the USA, the average annual age-adjusted Parkinson's disease mortality between 1962 and 1984 was estimated as 2 deaths per 100 000 for white men and 1 death per 100 000 for non-white men, 1 death per 100 000 for white women and less than 1 death per 100 000 for non-white women. Mortality increased for persons aged 75 years and older, but declined for those younger than 70 years. Overall, published evidence suggests that mortality for Parkinson's disease increases in the older age groups but decreases for younger ages. The cause of death in Parkinson's disease is most commonly a secondary comorbid disorder. A Japanese study showed that the most common cause of death for all patients, regardless of age, was pneumonia. Economic burden. Studies suggest that Parkinson's disease adversely affects the health-related quality of life of patients and imposes a significant economic burden on society comparable with that of other chronic conditions such as congestive heart failure, diabetes and stroke. Although it is difficult to measure the specific economic cost of Parkinson's disease, in the UK the annual direct cost of managing patients with Parkinson's disease at home is estimated at around £4189; the cost rises to £19 338 for full-time institutionalization. Furthermore, the total direct cost of Parkinson's disease in patients in 'good health' is three times lower than for those in 'poor health'. These figures do not take into account hidden indirect costs such as loss of income from premature retirement, for both the patient and carer. The main pathological feature of Parkinson's disease is the degeneration of neuromelanin-containing neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (Figure 2.1).

The lower brainstem nuclei are key areas mediating a myriad of non-motor symptoms such as sleep homeostasis, depression, fatigue, cognitive problems, pain, constipation and a reduction in central autonomic vagal control. Several of these symptoms are now recognized as possible prodromal features of Parkinson's disease.

It is now widely believed that the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease are not only due to the loss of a single monoamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, but also the effects of widespread Lewy body disease. This results in a convergence of deficits in multiple transmitter pathways, including the cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, which underpin many of the non-motor symptoms that are integral to Parkinson's disease (Figure 2.7). In addition, glial pathology, neuroimmune responses and proinflammatory cytokines are likely to play a key pathogenic role.

Where possible, advice from a genetic counselor must be obtained before genetic testing.","However, the SNCA and PARK3 mutations have not been found in many families with autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease or sporadic Parkinson's disease. Other mutations are being discovered elsewhere (see Table 2.2); mutation in PARK7 is linked to autosomal-recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease, and was identified in a Dutch and an Italian family, while leucine-rich repeat kinase (LRRK2; also known as PARK8), with a locus on chromosome 12, was identified in a Japanese family (see below). Autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism has been studied mainly in Japan. The gene associated with juvenile parkinsonism, PARK2, has been mapped to chromosome 6q. The same genetic mutation has been found in European families in individuals with juvenile or young-onset Parkinson's disease. PARK2 has a 30% homology with the gene that encodes ubiquitin, and is expressed in various regions of the brain (including the substantia nigra) and in liver, heart, testis and skeletal muscle. PARK2 encodes parkinson protein 2, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (parkin), which is involved in protein degradation. The PARK2 mutation appears to lead to defective protein ubiquination, leading to protein aggregation and cell death. Recent findings in the genetics of Parkinson's disease include the identification of mutations in LRRK2, which is involved in mitochondrial functioning, the powerhouse of cells. LRRK2 is part of the Roco family of genes. Mutation in LRRK2 has been associated with familial late-onset Parkinson's disease and a few cases of sporadic late-onset Parkinson's disease. The phenotype appears to be identical to sporadic Parkinson's disease, but is associated with behavioral disorders, leg tremor, sleep disturbances and slight cognitive decline. One case of an Ile1371Val substitution in LRRK2 has been reported, with the typical Lewy body pathology that stained positive for ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein and symptoms identical to idiopathic sporadic Parkinson's disease. The most common LRRK2 substitution is Gly2019Ser, which accounts for 2% of sporadic and 5% of familial cases.

The response to levodopa, or to dopaminergic agents such as apomorphine, has been used as a potential diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease but it is fraught with pitfalls. Many Parkinson-plus syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) also respond initially to levodopa or dopaminergic therapy, so the use of challenge tests for diagnostic purposes is not recommended. There is also concern about the use of levodopa in untreated levodopa-naive patients, since a possible priming action of levodopa for the development of future dyskinesias has been demonstrated in animal models. The authors stress the importance of the points shown in bold. Typically, a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's disease will show a significant response to dopaminergic agents; about 50% of patients will go on to develop dyskinesia after 2-5 years of standard therapy with levodopa (at doses exceeding 600 mg/day), although this proportion is lower when smaller doses of levodopa (150-300 mg/day) are given.",239,22,0.09205020920502092

Current opinion and guidelines recommend that all patients with a 'suspected' diagnosis of Parkinson's disease must be referred untreated to a specialist who can reliably differentiate between Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes. Initiation of treatment in primary care is discouraged. Referral to a specialist is important to ensure that diagnosis is as accurate as possible (approximately 96% certainty in specialist centers) and multidisciplinary team care is started promptly. Differential diagnoses. The key differential diagnoses include essential tremor, drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular pseudoparkinsonism and the Parkinson-plus syndromes such as MSA, PSP, dementia with Lewy bodies and corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (see Chapter 8).",284,56,0.19718309859154928
9781910797211,ch04,Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately.,"Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine and restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells. It has improved the quality of patients' lives substantially, and appears to have led to a reduction in mortality. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylation in the brain (Figure 4.1), but this can also occur outside the blood-brain barrier, leading to side effects such as nausea and postural hypotension. The addition of a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, such as carbidopa or benserazide, inhibits dopa decarboxylase in the rest of the body and reduces side effects. The bioavailability of levodopa has been enhanced further by the emergence of drugs such as tolcapone and entacapone, which inhibit catechol- O -methyl transferase (COMT), the enzyme principally responsible for the breakdown of dopamine.",199,32,0.16080402010050251

A postmortem study of 5 patients with essential tremor, who were mistakenly given sustained levodopa therapy, found no evidence of damage to nigral cells. In addition, patients who receive long-term levodopa for restless legs syndrome show no evidence of damage to the substantia nigra at autopsy. These findings should reassure patients receiving long-term levodopa. Levodopa dyskinesia. Chronic therapy with levodopa, however, results in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias due to Parkinson's disease progression coupled with the short half-life of levodopa. The ELLDOPA study (see below) in patients with early Parkinson's disease suggests that a higher dosage of levodopa leads to a higher frequency of dyskinesia. The development of dyskinesias has been shown to adversely affect patients' and carers' quality of life, and to at least double the cost of care. In order to prevent/delay dyskinesia, several trials have examined initiating treatment with a dopamine agonist such as ropinirole, pramipexole, cabergoline or pergolide. Many trials have compared these dopamine agonists with levodopa in previously untreated patients over a 4-5 year period.",288,51,0.17708333333333334

CDS may also improve some aspects of sleep in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, Nutt reinforced the idea that CDS remains a theoretical concept, and the effect of CDS on dyskinesias, to date, has never been tested in a robust randomized clinical trial. The STRIDE-PD study (see pages 66 -) with the drugs given orally every 3.5 hours probably failed to provide CDS. In practice, dopamine agonists are also useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa, as well as the many theoretical advantages listed in Table 4.4. Ropinirole and pramipexole are well-established non-ergot dopamine agonists in widespread clinical use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. Both are effective in early and late disease as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. In addition, pramipexole has been investigated for its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects in Parkinson's disease. A direct beneficial effect of pramipexole on depressive symptoms, accounting for 80% of total treatment effect, was found in a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the drug in 287 mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease patients with depressive symptoms.",286,52,0.18181818181818182

The American Psychiatric Association's DSM5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) defines impulse control disorders (ICDs) as the failure to resist an impulse, drive or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others. These are increasingly reported in Parkinson's disease and include a range of compulsive disorders (Table 4.5). Typically, the syndrome is characterized by a combination of impulsivity, compulsivity and preoccupation with a behavior or mood state. Unrecognized, ICDs can have serious consequences, such as breakdowns in interpersonal relationships and financial distress. The lifetime prevalence of ICDs, as reported by patients attending specialized clinics, is between 3 and 8%, although the DOMINION study reported a higher rate of 13.7% with ICDs, including problem/pathological gambling (5%), compulsive sexual behavior (3.5%), compulsive buying (5.7%) and binge-eating disorder (4.3%).",210,23,0.10952380952380952

Different international guidelines (NICE, AAN, EFNS/MDS-ES) all agree that there is no single universal first choice of drug for people with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the early stages of the condition. Individual choice of drug will be influenced, for example, by the degree of motor disability (if severe, the first choice is likely to be levodopa), occupational needs, the risk of motor complications (more common in younger patients, which would be delayed by agonists), neuropsychiatric complications (more common in older and cognitively impaired patients, so agonists should be avoided), patient/clinician preferences and adherence issues. For these reasons, many younger patients will choose a levodopa-sparing strategy, while older patients may prefer levodopa therapy (see below). Guidelines for the management of Parkinson's disease published in the UK by NICE in June 2006 offer evidence-based advice drawn up by a multidisciplinary panel. Key recommendations are that patients and their carers should be involved in deciding their treatment and care, and that the choice of treatment should suit the patient's needs and preferences.

If levodopa is used and the dose is titrated to the response, most patients initially need 50-100 mg three times daily to produce a consistent effect without fluctuations.

9781910797273,chp2,"Although still considered to be an organ-specific autoimmune disease, loss of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in newly forming MS lesions is a critical event that may trigger or amplify the inflammatory cascade that characterizes active demyelination.","The hallmark of the acute MS lesion is the abrupt appearance of large numbers of activated microglia and macrophages, outnumbering lymphocytes by at least 10-20 times, in concert with the start of myelin breakdown and focal disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Active lesions, which predominate in early relapsing MS, are defined pathologically by the presence of partially myelinated axons in tissue infiltrated by macrophages. When stained with Luxol fast-blue (a stain for myelin), these macrophages are found to contain myelin particles that are immunoreactive for myelin proteins (Figure 2.4). Most such macrophages, which display enhanced expression of CD45 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens, appear in sheets and are thought to derive primarily from resident microglia, rather than circulating monocytes. The nature of the macrophage 'attack' on apparently normal myelin is unclear. In the most widely accepted paradigm, phagocytic activity is directed by myelin-specific T cells in perivascular cuffs and, in lesser numbers, diffusely infiltrating the parenchyma within such lesions. The process is facilitated by the secretion of injurious toxins, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, reactive oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes. This hypothesis has been challenged by the neuropathological interrogation of ultra-acute (newly forming) MS lesions, which are characterized by extensive loss of oligodendrocytes without significant T-cell infiltrates. Whatever the cause, myelin loss from axons proceeds rapidly and is usually complete within 2 weeks of symptom onset.

New myelin is laid down by a population of oligodendrocytes that appears within lesions only days after an episode of acute inflammatory demyelination. These myelinating cells are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which must migrate from the periplaque white matter and mature before commencing the process of axon ensheathment. Although remyelination is the default response to demyelination in early relapsing disease, the process progressively fails with advancing disease and age in many patients. The subsequent loss of myelin-associated trophic signals contributes to axonal degeneration and the accrual of irreversible disability.

Although his condition was not diagnosed in his lifetime, from 1822 to 1846 he kept a detailed log of his symptoms, which included transient loss of vision, clumsiness of the hands, weakness of the legs, incontinence and dizziness. MS became recognized as a clinicopathological entity around 1870, when Charcot noted a link between the symptoms of MS and nerve damage. Over the next 50 years various hypotheses were promulgated, including an infectious cause, and oligoclonal bands were discovered in the cerebrospinal fluid. By 1950, it was clear that MS was a disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and by 1960 the beneficial effect of steroids in the management of acute relapses had been identified. By the 1990s the first injectable disease-modifying drugs were in use, and in 2001 criteria for the diagnosis of MS were revolutionized by the incorporation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate dissemination of lesions in space and time.

For example, therapies that reduce the frequency and severity of relapses may not be helpful to people with progressive disease. As all of the available treatments have potential side effects, all patients should be provided with a risk-benefit analysis appropriate to their MS subtype. The recognized patterns of MS are. relapsing remitting. secondary progressive. primary progressive. progressive relapsing. Relapsing remitting disease is the most common form of MS, accounting for 65-70% of patients. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by periods of acute neurological disturbance (relapses), which last for at least 24 hours and are not attributable to other causes such as infection or changes in core temperature. These relapses must occur after more than 30 days of clinical stability, and the neurological deficit must be established objectively by clinical evaluation (history and/or examination). In early disease, recovery after a relapse (remission) is often near complete, but incomplete recovery is common in established disease and in these instances patients with MS often accrue disability with each successive relapse (Figure 3.1). Secondary progressive disease. In most cases (up to 75% of people with relapsing remitting disease) there is an eventual progression to the secondary progressive phase of MS. This is defined as an initial relapsing remitting disease course followed by progression with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions and plateaus (Figure 3.2). Risk factors for progression to secondary progressive MS are shown in Table 3.1. The progression of disease from relapsing remitting to the secondary progressive stage is usually noted retrospectively, for example when a patient with MS has accumulated disability over 6-12 months without any discrete episodes of relapse. Neuroaxonal loss without any 'overt' features of inflammation (clinical or radiological) is thought to underlie this phase of MS (Figure 3.3).",409,62,0.15158924205378974

This indicates that there is an 'irritative' lesion at the level of the cervical cord and is thought to be due to stretching of hyperexcitable neurons in the dorsal column. It is common in MS, but can be associated with other causes of cervical spinal cord disease (exempli gratia cord compression, vitamin B deficiency, radiation myelopathy).

There are conflicts in the data regarding effectiveness of steroids, with some studies suggesting steroids improve overall outcome after relapse and others showing transient worsening after steroids. Corticosteroid therapy is therefore reserved either for patients with disabling relapses or for those with an occupational (or other) need to recover function faster than the natural history of the condition allows. Studies showing an improvement in patient-reported outcomes after steroid treatment may also contribute to the decision to prescribe these agents in order to help lessen symptomatology and improve quality of life. As poor recovery from relapse indicates an increased risk of long-term disability, there is a need to focus on adequate disease-modifying therapy aimed at reducing relapse frequency and the long-term consequences of such relapses. Reassessment after relapse comprises a full evaluation using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and/or Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) to determine if the patient has improved. In some studies, nearly 80% of EDSS and MSFC scores are near baseline 4 weeks after relapse, although the results are conflicting.",238,43,0.18067226890756302

Travel to areas of warm climate, exercise or pyrexia can result in overheating and transient deterioration in neurological function (Uhthoff's phenomenon). Intercurrent infection (bacterial or otherwise) activates inflammatory cytokines, which can result in a 'pseudo-relapse'. It is therefore important to exclude these types of exacerbation, particularly by checking for urinary sepsis, as they can be quickly and completely alleviated with appropriate antimicrobial and antipyretic therapies. Spasticity is a source of significant discomfort and disability in people with MS.

However, they may be used in combination with intermittent self-catheterization in patients with high urinary residual volumes and symptomatic detrusor overactivity. They may also be used as required in patients with mild urinary frequency and urgency. Desmopressin, 10-20 μg at night, is helpful in younger patients with nocturnal frequency and incontinence. Care should be taken to avoid fluid overload. A specialist urologic review should be sought for all patients who do not respond to anticholinergic therapies. Formal urodynamic studies may indicate more complex bladder dysfunction. If urgency and frequency are refractory to treatment, with a low residual volume of urine, then botulinum toxin A injections into the detrusor muscle via a cystoscope can be very successful (Figure 4.2). Botulinum toxin inhibits neurotransmitter release and reversibly decreases muscle contractility. Regeneration takes place within 5-9 months, so repeated injections may be necessary.

Acute burning/dysesthetic (spinothalamic) pain occasionally accompanies MS relapse. This pain may have a radicular distribution, but is commonly more diffuse and usually involves the lower limbs. Both anticonvulsant and tricyclic antidepressant therapies may be efficacious in this setting. The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) duloxetine may be particularly helpful for this indication. All these drugs reduce 'central' transmission of pain impulses either by blocking ion channels (lamotrigine, carbamazepine), increasing inhibitory effects on pain pathways (gabapentin, pregabalin) or altering neurotransmitter balance in favor of pain suppression (amitryptiline, nortryptiline, duloxetine).",169,41,0.24260355029585798

9781910797273,chp4,"Depression complicates the course of MS in up to 40% of patients and should be proactively managed with a program of physical exercise, behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy as indicated.","Seizures must be differentiated from paroxysmal movement disorders such as tonic spasms, kinesogenic choreoathetosis and some dystonias. The pathophysiology of these conditions is distinct from seizures; for example, aberrant (ephaptic) transmission of nerve impulses has been implicated in tonic spasms. Unlike seizures, they do not impair consciousness, may be painful and often have clear triggers such as changes in position. Careful history taking and, in more complex cases, electrophysiological studies, will help to clarify the diagnosis. Both seizures and paroxysmal symptoms may respond rapidly to anticonvulsant therapy, but a diagnosis of epilepsy can have profound effects on the social/employment status of the patient. The patient will be prohibited from driving for 6-12 months after a single seizure, depending on geographic location. Mood disorders, particularly depression, are extremely common in MS. Some studies estimate rates to be as high as 40%. In an age-matched population-based study, the incidence and prevalence of anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia were all higher in the MS population than in the matched population.

It is therefore important that people with MS receive appropriate information and support to assist them to stay in education and employment for as long as possible. It is important to highlight to patients that they are not obliged to disclose their illness to everyone at work, according to local laws, but as MS can affect physical, cognitive and emotional functioning, they are likely to need support in the workplace as the disease progresses. The specific diagnosis does not need to be disclosed to employers at interview (although disability will usually need to be). In the UK, for example, employers must be informed of the diagnosis if employment is in the armed forces, on a plane or on a ship. Some employment contracts specifically request disclosure of diagnoses like MS, as most employers need to know about specific disabilities in order to adhere to the relevant laws in their country.

It is not 100% specific; however, in the correct clinical and histopathological setting it can be useful in determining monoclonality of the malignant lymphocytes. Matching clones identified from different samples are more useful in the diagnosis.","T-cell receptor polymerase chain reaction. To date, the use of TCR PCR to identify monoclonal rearrangements of lymphocytes has been a mainstay of practice (although some authors feel it should not be used in early disease). Up to 80-90% of cases of MF are shown to have clonal populations for beta and/or gamma genes (Figure 3.24), although this may only be 50-60% in early disease. However, T-cell clonality is not specific to MF. Autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory processes can also have clonal T-cell populations. Distinguishing between CTCL and inflammatory disorders has a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 74%. Other pitfalls of TCR PCR include difficulty in interpreting oligoclonal peaks and clonal heterogeneity, false negative results due to primer annealing and other technical issues, and false positive results due to preferential amplification with limited lymphoid populations. For these reasons, duplicate analyses are recommended to identify definitive clonality. TCR PCR can be particularly helpful if the histopathology is non-diagnostic or if there is a clinicopathological mismatch. Finding matching clones in separate cutaneous biopsies and/or blood samples is very beneficial in diagnosing the more clinically and histologically challenging cases. Finding clonality on TCR PCR is particularly crucial to diagnosis and prognosis when determining if a lymph node has tumor involvement or whether it is dermatographic/reactive in nature. It is also crucial in the diagnosis of SS, although clonal studies may be negative in early SS and the presence of a 'benign' positive TCR clone in the peripheral blood of an elderly individual can occur. With this in mind, the presence of matching clones in the blood and skin are more diagnostically informative and specific for a diagnosis of SS. Next generation sequencing/high throughput sequencing (NGS/HTS) may eventually replace TCR PCR, although it is too early to know for certain. A recent study showed that this platform more accurately diagnosed all stages of CTCL and, perhaps more importantly, helped to distinguish CTCL from benign inflammatory conditions. The decrease and eradication of clonal populations seen on NGS/HTS has also been used to identify treatment response.

The use of IP chemotherapy has been advocated for small-volume residual disease, given that an extremely high peritoneal to serum drug concentration ratio can potentially be achieved by this approach. Several randomized studies have shown that IP therapy can produce improvements of 20-30% in PFS, OS, or both (Table 6.3). - However, to date the GOG252 trial has not shown an advantage for IP therapy in terms of the primary endpoint, PFS; it has been suggested that the lower doses of drug used in this study, and the use of bevacizumab in all three arms of the trial, may have confounded the efficacy results. Increased toxicity is an important concern in patients receiving IP chemotherapy. For example, in the GOG172 trial, which compared intravenous and IP paclitaxel and cisplatin, grade 3/4 fatigue, pain or hematologic, gastrointestinal, metabolic or neurological toxicities were significantly more common with IP than with intravenous therapy (Table 6.4).

Among the tumors with a better prognostic histology, high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) commonly present with p53 mutations and overall genomic instability, while endometrioid tumors often exhibit PTEN and PI3K mutations. By contrast, mucinous and clear cell tumors confer a significantly worse prognosis, and are more usually associated with KRAS and ARID1A mutations. These findings, particularly in tumors with poor prognostic histologies, offer opportunities to design clinical trials targeting these molecular pathways. Several different strategies have been advocated for targeted approaches to ovarian cancer, generally involving identification of a gene or protein that is overexpressed and can be reasonably targeted with acceptable toxicity (Figure 8.2).

The concept is that if the immune system can learn to recognize malignant cells as foreign antigens, a robust T-cell mediated response, among other pathways, could be induced. Cancer cells evade these tumor-directed T cells by subverting immune checkpoint pathways and other immune-regulatory mechanisms. This observation has led to the identification of numerous targets and therapeutic strategies with checkpoint inhibitors and other agents (Figure 8.4). Checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death (PD)-1, prevent the immune system from activating a response, and some tumor cells are able to express the ligand that binds to this protein (PD-L1), thereby suppressing an immune response. Antibodies that target the PD-1 protein or its ligand can block this suppression and thereby activate an immune response. Another important protein on the T cell, which if bound and activated can suppress an immune response, is cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4).",215,50,0.23255813953488372

This requires a prostate biopsy which will give definitive histological evidence of prostate cancer and also the cancer grade (Gleason grade group; see pages 14 -). Multiparametric MRI is increasingly used before biopsy to identify suspicious lesions within the prostate that would allow targeted biopsy, and may also mean that biopsy can be avoided in some men with normal MRI findings and lower levels of suspicion.",129,21,0.16279069767441862
9781910797457,chp4,Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed on the basis of transrectal or transperineal biopsy.,"Accuracy. The combination of MRI methods is claimed to significantly improve the detection and local staging of prostate cancer by MRI, and is now widely used before prostate biopsy to target suspicious areas, and to follow up patients managed by active surveillance. Indeed, some are now arguing that prior MRI is a prerequisite to improve the accuracy of biopsy and to avoid false-negative findings. Furthermore, in cases where a biopsy is warranted, a negative finding on MRI can provide reassurance to the patient, id est that they don't have prostate cancer. The recently completed PROMIS study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of an mpMRI scan followed by both template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy and standard transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy in 576 men with suspected prostate cancer. Fewer than half (40%) of those who underwent TPM were diagnosed with aggressive cancer, and mpMRI identified 93% of the clinically significant cancers, whereas the TRUS biopsy only correctly identified 48%. Furthermore, nine out of 10 men (89%) who had a negative mpMRI scan did not have a cancer, or had a harmless cancer. The authors concluded that prior MRI avoids unnecessary TRUS biopsy in 27% of men whilst reducing the number of men who are 'over diagnosed' by 5%. If subsequent TRUS biopsy is directed by mpMRI findings, up to 18% more cases of clinically significant cancer might be detected compared with using TRUS biopsy in all patients.",301,21,0.06976744186046512

Usually 12-18 TRUS-guided biopsies are taken from different regions of the prostate using an 18-gauge needle. Antibiotics are obligatory before and after the procedure to reduce the risk of infection, currently estimated at 2-5%, although this may be rising because of increases in the antibiotic resistance of bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli. A quinolone is the usual choice, sometimes in combination with gentamicin or amikacin, depending on prostate size, personal preference and previous biopsy results.

Men who present with newly diagnosed, well- or moderately well-differentiated prostate cancer, no skeletal symptoms and a serum PSA value of 10 ng/mL or less may not need a staging radionuclide bone scan because the probability of skeletal metastases approaches zero. However, many clinicians still like to use this test as a baseline investigation, because it may identify 'hot spots' due to conditions such as degenerative osteoarthritis that may cause confusion later, if the PSA level starts to rise.

Nomograms are based on data from thousands of patients and are used to predict the pathological likelihood of seminal vesicle invasion, lymph node metastasis and extracapsular extension on each side, or the presence of a small, insignificant cancer. Other nomograms have been developed to predict the likelihood of recurrence of cancer after radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy.

These men are eligible for curative therapy but this option is often deferred until objective signs of disease progression are observed. This approach means that the majority of men (60-70%) are spared the side effects of curative therapy that they do not require. Recent studies have shown that men with low-risk prostate cancer have a low risk of developing metastases, although the risk is reasonably high for men with intermediate-risk cancers. Therefore, younger men with intermediate risk cancers should usually be encouraged to choose treatment rather than active surveillance.",156,16,0.10256410256410256

Increasingly, multiparametric MRI (see page 45) is also being used to select patients for entry or follow-up in active surveillance protocols. Curative-intent therapy is initiated if the cancer shows signs of progression and before it becomes incurable. Cancer-specific survival in men who fit the criteria for active surveillance is 99% at 8 years' follow-up. While men avoid the physical side effects of treatment, they do have to live with the psychological effects of having an untreated cancer, although these do not seem to be troublesome for most men.

Given that prostate cancer has a long natural history, this is an important consideration in terms of the patient's quality of life. Long-term studies have shown normal life expectancy in patients with complete excision of specimen-confined disease. Ten-year survival for men with clinically localized disease treated with radical prostatectomy is 98% for Gleason grade group 1, and 91% and 76% for groups 2-3 and 4-5, respectively.

A prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scan (see page 52) may reveal sites of cancer recurrence at very low PSA levels, typically in the prostate bed (after prostatectomy), within the prostate (after radiotherapy) or in more distant lymph nodes or bone sites. Less commonly, pulmonary metastases may be detected. The likelihood of having a positive PSMA PET scan at various PSA levels is shown in Figure 6.1.

Renal dysfunction leads to a decline in erythropoietin production through the loss of erythropoietin-producing cells in the kidney. However, it is unusual to see significant anemia due to renal failure until the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) drops below 20 mL/minute. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and the consequent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin-receptor blockade, also reduces erythropoietin production and causes a modest reduction in hemoglobin. Investigation. It is still unclear whether anemia in HF represents a marker of disease severity and is therefore a prognostic tool, or whether it is a mediator of poorer outcomes and therefore represents a therapeutic target. However, there is evidence that it can worsen cardiac function and symptoms and that correction improves outcome (although further studies are required). Therefore, anemia should be regarded as an easily identifiable and potentially remediable aspect of the disease (Figure 4.1). Common and reversible causes of anemia such as hematinic deficiencies require exclusion, although the underlying etiology is often multifactorial, with the pentad of chronic renal failure, neurohormonal activation, a proinflammatory cytokine milieu, defective erythropoietin production and defective bone marrow function contributing in varying proportions. Blood transfusion may be appropriate in an acute setting for selected patients with severe anemia. The benefit is rapid correction of anemia, although this must be weighed against the risks of circulatory overload, transfusion-transmitted infection, hemolytic transfusion reactions and the longer-term issues of alloimmunization and iron overload.",364,65,0.17857142857142858

Untreated sleep-disordered breathing is associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Moderate-to-severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] > 15) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy has been shown to be independently associated with increased mortality (mainly due to sudden cardiac death). A similar association has not been observed in patients without cardiac ischemia.

Treatment with CPAP alleviates episodes of OSA and associated physiological consequences that may lead to a reduction in LV afterload and ongoing oxidative stress. However, up to 30% of patients may not be able to tolerate it. Evidence that CPAP has a positive effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with HF is lacking, despite observational studies reporting a decrease in sympathetic nervous activity, and blood pressure and improvement in cardiac performance (LVEF). Hence, the current indications for CPAP in patients with HF and sleep-disordered breathing are limited to management of diurnal hypersomnolence. Disappointingly, a recent study of CPAP in patients with predominant CSA showed an increase in mortality in the treatment group. Renal disease. Renal dysfunction is frequently found in patients hospitalized with HF and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Up to 50% of ambulatory patients with stable HF have some degree of renal dysfunction. Moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction in patients with HF increases the relative mortality risk by 100% (absolute risk > 50% at 5 years).

Patients with acute HF can present with one of several distinct hemodynamic profiles, based on the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold) (Figure 5.3). More specific for acute HF is Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention. Arrhythmias may play a part in both acute and chronic HF. Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement. Atrial arrhythmias contribute to reduced functional capacity, as atrial systole makes an important contribution to stroke volume, especially in the context of LV filling problems and particularly with exercise. Although some patients die from progressive HF, ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF.

The majority of HF care is conducted in the home by either the patient and/or the caregiver. It is therefore essential that all patients with HF and those who care for them receive comprehensive education and counseling to develop the knowledge, skills, strategies, problem-solving approaches and motivation required to adhere to a complex treatment plan and effectively participate in HF self-care. It is important to include carers and family members in this education as patients with HF often experience difficulties with cognition, functional ability and other conditions that may limit their understanding of what is required. Non-adherence to HF management plans can be related to patient and/or caregiver misconceptions and lack of knowledge. Self-care involves active participation in the maintenance and management of HF. Included within self-care maintenance are healthy lifestyle choices, treatment adherence and monitoring of behaviors.

The resulting hypoxia could have negative cardiovascular consequences in patients with HF. Effects of hypoxia in heart failure. Significant hypoxia may have a deleterious effect on patients suffering from LV dysfunction. It can lead to tachycardia or an elevation in systemic and pulmonary blood pressure, and can even trigger arrhythmia or coronary ischemia in patients with underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). However, in patients with HF, pulmonary vasoconstriction may help protect the pulmonary microvasculature from increased pressure.

Pain also triggers processes that dampen the perception of nociceptive stimuli.

These descending inhibitory systems are stimulated by endogenous opioids, as well as monoamines such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and serotonin.

9781910797495,chp1,Nerve injury produces hyperexcitability and spontaneous generation of ectopic impulses in axons and neurons.,"Peripheral nerve injury produces axonal membrane hyper-excitability that leads to spontaneous generation of ectopic impulses. In addition, changes in the chemical environment surrounding the damaged axon trigger ectopic nerve action potentials, which lead to further impulses (Figure 1.4). Abnormal repetitive firing of injured axons occurs because sodium channels accumulate at the site of injury, creating a lower threshold for the initiation of action potentials (Figure 1.5). Abeta fibers rather than C fibers show the greatest degree of spontaneous ectopic discharge after peripheral nerve injury. Abeta fibers are specialized for light touch and are therefore likely to mediate the allodynia experienced after nerve injury. Nerve injury also triggers the production of a series of inflammatory mediators that promote ectopic activity in primary afferent fibers. These mediators are produced by macrophages that migrate to sites of nerve injury and contribute to chronic inflammation in their immediate environment.",187,21,0.11229946524064172
9781910797495,chp1,Ectopic peripheral nerve activity contributes to the central hyperexcitable state and enlargement of neuronal receptive fields.,The sensitization (increased excitability) and increased synaptic efficacy of second-order neurons termed 'wide dynamic range neurons' (id est neurons that respond to a range of noxious and non-noxious stimuli) could explain the allodynia that patients experience after nerve injury. The central hyperexcitable state and enlargement of the area in the periphery where stimulation evokes a neuronal response are sustained by ectopic peripheral nerve activity that causes ongoing release of neurotransmitters in the spinal cord (see Figure 1.3).,106,23,0.2169811320754717
9781910797495,chp1,After nerve injury there may be a loss of spinal inhibition control resulting from loss of neuronal inhibitory processes and persistence of glia-induced neuronal hypersensitivity. The connectivity of sympathic fibers to injured neurons contributes to the activation of pain by stress. All three of these maladaptions may play a major role in chronic neuropathic pain.,"The processes shown in Figure 1.8 can become prolonged, lasting past the time of healing and resulting in chronic neuronal hypersensitivity and persisting (chronic) neuropathic pain. Thus, new treatments for chronic neuropathic pain could focus on the cause of the ongoing pain - overactive glia. At least nine anti-glial drugs are being evaluated. AV411 (or MN-166, ibudilast) inhibits astrocytes. In 2016, it received 'fast track' designation by the FDA for its potential use in multiple sclerosis (MS). Etanercept and the antibiotic minocycline, which both inhibit microglia activation, have shown promise in animal studies but have not proven successful in human studies of pain. The cannabinoid Sativex, which inhibits CB2 cannabinoid spinal receptors on glia, is being studied for neuropathic pain due to MS and in trials of tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol (THC:CBD) extract in patients with intractable cancer-related pain. It has been successful in two of three clinical trials for neuropathic pain in humans. Sativex is approved in many countries for the treatment of spasticity in people with MS. As glia appear to play a key role in opioid tolerance and withdrawal, these drugs may also slow the development of tolerance to opioids. Increased glial cell activity normally subsides gradually after injury; its continuation in some patients may be one of the keys to 'what goes wrong in chronic pain'. Chronic use of opioid drugs seems to play a role in glial cell activation, thus increasing pain and decreasing opioid analgesia in a vicious circle (see Figure 1.8). Loss of inhibition. Moreover, after nerve injury there is also a loss of spinal inhibitory control. Mitochondrial superoxide is produced after the influx of calcium associated with nerve injury, and leads to cell dysfunction and the death of interneurons with inhibitory control. The death of these neurons could explain the decrease in GABA, an inhibitory transmitter, in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord after nerve damage, as shown by immunoreactivity experiments (Figure 1.9). Finally, the persistent afferent input after peripheral nerve injury provokes changes in the nerve structure of the rostroventromedial medulla. These changes in turn encourage tonic discharge (firing at regular intervals) of the descending pathways that facilitate nociceptive transmission, further perpetuating the hyperexcitable state observed after nerve injury.",512,67,0.130859375

Such learning processes are accompanied by neuroplasticity changes at multiple levels of the nervous system. Encoding of pain memory is enhanced by circumstantial fear; for example, when injury occurs in highly stressful circumstances such as that associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction (unlearning) plays a key role in keeping neuroplasticity changes in check after nerve injury. However, in patients with chronic neuropathic pain, extinction processes may be impaired.

This is why each chapter refers to studies of pharmacological management of specific pain types (exempli gratia post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury pain). Antiepileptics, antidepressants and other drugs useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain are outlined in Tables 3.2 and 3.3. Antidepressants act as analgesics via a wide range of mechanisms. TCAs and SNRIs are superior to SSRIs. In future, it is likely there will be individualized pharmacotherapy for each patient and for each neuropathic (and other) pain condition. For the time being, success with particular drug types in some but not other pain conditions gives us clues to improving treatment. For example, it is known that trigeminal neuralgia is a unique neuropathic pain condition with paroxysms (or 'lightning bolts') of pain. The paroxysms are directly related to spontaneous action potentials (APs) in trigeminal system neurons (see Chapter 1). As these APs involve the sodium channels, treatment should include sodium channel-blocking drugs of which carbamazepine is one example. Basic studies reveal that there are nine subtypes of sodium channel and it appears that the Na V 1.8 channel is the most effective for neuropathic pain, while having a wide margin of safety before CNS (brain/convulsions) and cardiovascular system (arrhythmogenic or hypotension) adverse effects. Attempts are therefore being made to develop Na V 1.8 and other sodium channel subtype blockers.",418,34,0.08133971291866028

Patients describe the severe, often excruciating, pain as sharp, stabbing or burning in quality, usually lasting between seconds and less than 2 minutes. A few progress to less intense persistent pain between paroxysms. Remission can be months and even many years, but generally the attacks become shorter over time.

9781910797495,chp4,"Medical management remains the first line of treatment. Carbamazepine, traditionally the drug of choice, is often replaced by gabapentin and pregabalin because of fewer side effects. Patients hospitalized because of the severity of pain may be effectively controlled by use of a subcutaneous infusion of lidocaine (lignocaine).","If medical management has failed and the patient can tolerate surgery, microvascular decompression of the trigeminal neural complex (also known as the Jannetta procedure) is the preferred treatment. This procedure directly treats the cause of the problem without destroying any neural tissue. Morbidity and mortality are low. Pain relief persists in more than 85% of patients at 5-year follow-up, with no risk of sensory loss. Many patients have complete abolition of pain - a result that is attainable for very few chronic pain conditions. In older patients, percutaneous radiofrequency lesioning of the affected components of the trigeminal complex is the method of choice. This is a rapid and highly controllable procedure that aims to minimize risk of sensory loss. However, pain tends to recur after about 3 years and about 5% of patients have painful sensory loss (anesthesia dolorosa). Balloon compression and retro-Gasserian glycerol injection are alternative lesioning procedures. Unfortunately, there are no comparative studies among invasive procedures, so the choice is often guided by operator expertise in a particular technique. For non-responders and those in whom the pain relief is only temporary, a new or repeat procedure is sometimes performed. The long-term effectiveness of this strategy is unknown, and the risk of producing new neurological deficits is higher.

Pain alleviation after sympathetic nerve blockade or sympatholytic drug therapy is not consistent, and relapses are common. Motor abnormalities, found in 50% of patients with CRPS, are most probably generated by changes in brain motor neurons. Baron's group in Germany has reported disturbed integration of visual and proprioceptive inputs in the posterior parietal cortices of patients with CRPS. Also, functional MRI during finger tapping of the affected limb in patients with CRPS showed reorganization of central motor circuits. The degree of reorganization correlated with the extent of motor dysfunction detected by clinical examination. Thus, it seems clear that maladaptive changes in the brain motor system contribute to motor symptoms in patients with CRPS. This is further evidence of chronic pain as a 'disease entity'.

However, Craig et al. have provided evidence of a key role of ventromedial posterior thalamic lesions that allow disinhibition of a medial spinothalamic tract projecting via the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus to the anterior cingulate cortex (limbic system) - this appears to be associated with the burning nature of central post-stroke pain and also generates cold hypesthesia. In 2007, Kim et al. reported that lesions limited to the ventral caudal thalamic nucleus may produce a similar presentation of central post-stroke pain. Thus, there are several sites of lesion associated with post-stroke pain; unfortunately, this does not yet provide insight into the precise mechanisms of such pain. Pain following spinal cord injury. The study of central pain arising from SCI has been more productive than that of post-stroke pain. Key insight was provided from a 5-year follow-up study of SCI pain by Siddall et al., which reported that at-level SCI pain often progressed to below-level pain - suggesting spinal and supraspinal mechanisms triggered by at-level SCI pain predispose to below-level 'central' pain.",374,83,0.22192513368983957

The relative roles of each level in at-level and below-level SCI pain remain to be clarified. An important aspect is the relationship of post-SCI neuropathic pain and hyperreflexic responses (autonomic hyperreflexia). It has long been known that complete SCI lesions remove descending inhibitory control and allow severe autonomic mass reflexes. An example is severe vasoconstriction in response to a noxious stimulus - the vasoconstriction increases blood pressure which, in turn, activates vasomotor and other brainstem and brain structures, resulting in exacerbation of neuropathic pain (Figure 7.2).",159,28,0.1761006289308176

More than 8% of all patients who have had a stroke suffer with central pain. In view of the high incidence of stroke, about 90% of all central pain is associated with stroke. Because stroke is associated with communication difficulties, the high prevalence of central pain was not recognized until quite recently.

However, differential diagnosis of the type of pain is crucial to distinguish nociceptive pain and peripheral neuropathic pain from central pain (see Table 7.2). The impact of central pain on the individual is usually severe, so a multidisciplinary assessment in a biopsychosocial framework is essential. In many cases a multimodal approach to treatment needs to incorporate pharmacological, psychological and physical therapy strategies. Invasive procedures may be needed in extreme cases.

For example, small joint OA (distal and proximal interphalangeal) is often painful for months while clinical deformity is first developing, after which the joint may be stiff but less painful.

However, recent studies have called into question the true benefit of paracetamol in OA. The site of action of the drug, which has some weak anti-inflammatory action, seems to be in the central nervous system (CNS). Safety concerns have resulted in the recommended dose being reduced to 3 g/day or less; many people do not take adequate regular doses, probably because they are concerned about the number of tablets required. Paracetamol can be used in combination with oral agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or in formulations with mild opioids. Side effects. Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver and can accumulate in patients with chronic liver disease. The major concern lies in overdose, which can lead to acute hepatic toxicity that may be enhanced by alcohol. Despite its relative safety, recent data suggest that higher-dose paracetamol (more than 3 g/day) may still lead to upper gastrointestinal side effects, including bleeding, and may negatively affect renal function and blood pressure with daily use.",246,44,0.17886178861788618

In general, extra caution should be exercised when using these drugs in elderly patients, as there are higher incidences of important side effects, including confusion. Certainly, patients should be fully informed of the potential risks associated with these agents. Table 8.2 provides a summary of prescribing advice with respect to GI and CV risk. A safe rule is to use the lowest possible dose of drug for the shortest period of time. In the USA, certain insurers/reimbursers require evidence of prior use of the less expensive non-selective NSAIDs before providing prescription coverage for the COX-2-selective NSAIDs.

9781910797617,chp1,Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time.,"Advances in genetics have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML. Although in-depth understanding of the relationship between a specific genetic mutation and a specific pathophysiological or clinical feature is clear in only a few cases, this is slowly changing. One such example is the association of the PML-RARA fusion gene with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of AML (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The PML-RARA fusion gene is typically detected as a chromosomal rearrangement: t(15;17)(q22;q21). Patients with APL have a high risk for fatal hemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the consequence of a halt in myeloid differentiation that is mediated by the PML-RARA fusion gene. The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development. In normal cells, RARA encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors; PML is important in controlling proliferation and apoptosis, among other processes. The PML-RARA fusion protein suppresses gene transcription and blocks differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage, resulting in the accumulation of malignant promyelocytes seen in APL. Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage. The complex role of the PML-RARA fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood.

Actions have included education via the mass media and social marketing, the involvement of prominent people as opinion leaders, and initiatives to increase personal contact between people with and without mental health problems. Missed diagnoses. There is good evidence that depression is often not recognized by clinicians and that even when it is identified, it is frequently inadequately managed by health services in the USA, UK and other countries. Research indicates that 30-50% of depression cases are missed in primary care, and it appears that recognition problems are amplified by the presence of comorbid medical conditions, which complicate the help-seeking and assessment processes. Classification. At a fundamental level, important questions and uncertainties remain about the best way to understand and classify depression. A central debate about the relative merits of categorical (case or non-case based on a specific pattern of symptoms) or dimensional (based on measures of symptom severity or prior illness course) approaches to classification is particularly relevant to this disorder. A continuity between milder forms of depression and a fully symptomatic disorder appears in community studies that have examined course and correlates for a range of presentations. Depression that does not meet the full criteria for a formal diagnosis is increasingly recognized to cause considerable suffering and places a significant burden on the healthcare system; it is also related to increased mortality and is a risk factor for future major depression.",400,71,0.1775

Diagnosis is based on the symptom profile and the severity, duration and course of the disorder. It is characterized by low mood and the absence of positive affect (id est loss of interest and enjoyment in everyday activities), together with a range of emotional, cognitive, physical and behavioral features. Clinical depression is a heterogeneous disorder, with some forms having clear biological underpinnings whereas others arise from psychosocial adversity. While classification systems have specified diagnostic criteria, uncertainties remain about the validity of the threshold that differentiates clinical depression from 'normal' unhappiness. Some investigators and commentators have questioned the validity of depression on the basis of variations that are purported to exist in its presentation, prevalence, prognosis and meaning within different cultures. Some commentators identify psychiatric diagnoses such as depression as 'Western' categories that can be imposed on non-Western peoples - a form of medical imperialism.",216,40,0.18518518518518517

In the community, as well as in primary care settings, the most prevalent mood disorder is a combination of depression and anxiety. The overlap between symptoms such as low mood, lack of energy, insomnia, worry and irritability is considerable; for example, in 2014, nearly 8% of the UK household population demonstrated this combination of symptoms to a clinically significant extent, although smaller proportions have sufficient symptoms to be diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorders. Among people who meet the diagnostic thresholds for depression or anxiety disorders there is also a high degree of concurrence of these conditions, raising questions about the specificity of these diagnostic categories. While there is no distinct etiology for depression - it is best conceptualized as having a mix of biopsychosocial and lifestyle factors that contribute to its onset - a common genetic factor for anxiety and depressive conditions is apparent, and similarities in the types of environmental adversities that seem to provoke depression and anxiety, such as childhood adversity, have been reported.

A systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating 60 prevalence, incidence and persistence studies revealed compelling evidence for the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and depression, although constituent variables such as education, occupation, employment and income exerted differing influences.

Rates of self-harm peak around the age of 14-17 years, with this appearing consistent in cross-national studies. A higher frequency of self-harm in adolescence is correlated with the consumption of cigarettes or alcohol and the frequency of being intoxicated (particularly in women), and all categories of drug misuse. It is also associated with being bullied, including cyber bullying on social media, or 'trolling', and with physical and sexual abuse.

The Keynote-045 Phase III trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab was active in the second-line setting for patients whose cancers had progressed after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and provided a significant overall survival (OS) benefit compared with standard chemotherapy: 10.3 versus 7.4 months (hazard ratio for death 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.91; p = 0.002). Other drugs in this class are likely to have similar efficacy, as illustrated in Table 8.3. However, study design needs to be considered carefully when looking at trial results. For example, the IMvigor 211 trial, which compared atezolizumab versus chemotherapy following failure of platinum-based chemotherapy, did not meet its OS primary endpoint, although this was probably because of the way the statistical analysis was planned, and overconfidence in the PD-L1 tissue assay: the outcome was negative for the apparently PD-L1-expressing subset but positive when the entire study population was included.",242,31,0.128099173553719

This is changing with the development of immunotherapies and the pressure to be able to identify patients who are likely to benefit from treatment with particular monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and BRAF mutations in melanoma. Availability of such validated tests would allow rational use of the drugs and avoid exposing patients to the adverse effects of drugs that might provide no clinical benefit. However, BRAF and HER2 are 'driver' molecules and their status can be accurately determined, whereas this is not the case with PD-L1. Expression of PD-L1 is often associated with poorer outcomes in bladder cancer, regardless of the treatment used. It is logical to expect that expression of PD-L1 by tumor, immune or other cells in the tumor deposit would predict response to therapies targeted at the PD-1 axis; however, this has not yet been reliably shown to be the case, mainly because of deficiencies and variability in the available tissue-based assays for PD-L1.",239,51,0.21338912133891214

Importantly, PD-L1 expression is both dynamic and sporadic: it probably changes over short periods, and PD-L1 is not necessarily expressed by all cells. It is therefore not surprising that measurement of PD-L1 expression in a small sample of tissue, perhaps obtained many years previously and stored under suboptimal conditions, does not correlate well with the probability of response to PD-1 axis blockade. Tissue PD-L1 expression has reasonable positive predictive value, in that cancers that are positive for PD-L1 expression are generally more likely to respond to PD-1-targeted therapies. However, cancers that do not appear to express PD-L1 may still respond to therapies targeted at the PD-1 axis.",158,36,0.22784810126582278
9781910797662,ch08,Combination strategies are being explored; these may be more active than monotherapies but are likely to be more toxic and more costly.,"The main adverse effects of immunotherapy relate to autoimmunity, that is, unmasking of immune responses against normal tissues. The systems most commonly affected are the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, endocrine system (including hypophysitis) and respiratory tract. However, rarer effects can occur, such as neurological or myocardial autoimmunity. Patients need to be treated by teams experienced in the management of these effects, and should be fully informed so that subtle autoimmunity can be detected and treated before significant toxicity occurs. Examples include endocrine dysfunction (panhypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, hypoadrenalism), which can be subtle in presentation and easily missed but which can become life-threatening. Similarly, mild diarrhea may result from autoimmune colitis but without treatment can deteriorate and become fatal. Immune-related adverse events can usually be managed according to algorithms for immunosuppression, although some patients may not recover and may need ongoing management such as hormone replacement therapy. Interestingly, autoimmunity is correlated with an increased probability of an anticancer benefit but treatment of autoimmunity does not abrogate the antitumor effect.

A 2016 study of all European-approved originator monoclonal antibodies identified a mean of 11 changes with moderate or high potential risk per drug. Process change can result from advances in technology, such as higher yielding host cell systems, improvements in bioreactor design, scaling up of production to meet demand or if production is moved to a new manufacturing site. Changes in manufacturing risks the introduction of more significant variation in the tertiary structure of a biologic, known as 'step changes' (see Figure 1.3). Comparability of the drug before and after a step change needs to be demonstrated to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed. This comparability is usually assessed using only analytic tests although, rarely, new regulatory trials have been required. One example, a step change resulting from a new process in the manufacture of darbepoetin-alfa required confirmation through additional phase I, II and III studies.

Manufacturers and regulators define quality according to critical 'quality attributes': chemical, physical and biological properties that need to be within agreed tolerances.

Biologic and biosimilar drug developers can determine the natural variation in the structure and biopotency of the reference drug from sequential batches of the drug.

As can be seen, the evidence required for biosimilars is greater than that for generic versions of small molecule drugs. European regulation of biosimilars. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) pioneered the regulation of safe and effective copies of biologic drugs without having to recreate the full drug development steps of an original reference drug. The agency adapted the 'biosimilar pathway' from the existing regulatory pathway designed for reference drugs following a manufacturing change. This process recognizes that all biologic drugs vary in structure and potency over time, such that identical copies of a biologic drug can never be made (see page 11). The critical attributes of a biologic or biosimilar can be followed with high acuity analytics and must be maintained within a range which ensures that the product, whilst not identical, is similar enough to predict that the safety and efficacy would show no clinically meaningful differences.",194,21,0.10824742268041238
9781910797693,chp4,"The 'biosimilar pathway' developed by the European Medicines Agency follows the principles that apply following a change to manufacturing of a biologic. Central to the pathway is the demonstration that there are no significant clinical differences between a biosimilar and its reference biologic, based on analytical, preclinical and clinical data.","The only major difference between the biosimilar pathway and the protocol following a manufacturing change is that Phase I and III trials are required for all biosimilars in at least one indication (see next section); these studies must include evaluation of immunogenicity, which is difficult to predict without human studies. In contrast to originator drugs, which require pivotal clinical trials to gain new approved indications, biosimilars may gain approval by extrapolating the equivalence demonstrated in one approved indication to another. Clinical studies are required for additional indications if the approved indications have different mechanisms of action (MOA) or mechanisms of toxicity (MOT) that could suggest a potential risk to drug safety or efficacy. The biosimilar pathway. In Europe biologics are assessed centrally by the EMA. The 'biosimilar pathway' was established in 2003 and shows significant difference with the regulatory pathway for small molecule generic drugs, as shown in Figure 4.1. Central to this pathway is the demonstration that there are no significant clinical differences between the biosimilar and the reference biological product. However, it is not necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy across all the indications of the originator brand: based on the expectation that the biosimilar and reference biological agent have the same safety and efficacy, they can be used to treat the same indications. This concept of extrapolation is explained in more detail on page 33. There is no single analytic test for a biosimilar, whether chemical or clinical. Approval is based on the totality of data built up in a stepwise fashion from initial chemical analytics, biopotency modelling, and toxicology, through to Phase I and, finally, comparative Phase III trials (see Figure 4.1).

Without either a 'biosimilarity exercise' or the security of a large-scale Phase 3 trial, the safety and efficacy of these copies cannot be predicted. Furthermore, the infrastructure to produce evidence relating to safety and efficacy may be poor. For less wealthy nations, abbreviated drug development and regulatory pathways for the approval of biosimilars can cut costs and deliver affordable medicines. This lack of regulation has resulted in the introduction of many copies of biologics. Early marketing in poorer nations is possible because intellectual property laws are not applied or are ignored. As a result, many versions of biologics will have been used in Asia, Africa and South America before biosimilar versions can be approved and launched in the highly regulated markets of Europe, the USA, and Japan. Prescribers therefore need to be aware that some products available outside of Europe, the USA and Japan are not true biosimilars and have not been subjected to the same robust regulatory scrutiny.",260,35,0.1346153846153846

In Thailand, more than a dozen different copies of epoetin-alfa were marketed but had not been approved through stringent regulatory procedures such as in the EU and USA. Simple analytics such as isoelectric gel chromatography showed that many of these copies were structurally different from the reference drug (epoetin-alfa Epogen ®). Twelve such intended copy biologics were analyzed in a joint Thai-Dutch study. Some showed high aggregate levels and contained substantial levels of protein fragments - a critical attribute of these medicines that has been strongly associated with a rare but potentially fatal adverse drug reaction., Epoetin aggregates can promote the development of anti-drug immune reactions which can neutralize both the medicine and the erythropoietin produced by the kidneys, causing pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Affected patients become profoundly anemic and transfusion dependent, and will die if the auto-immunity cannot be suppressed. It is therefore not surprising that an outbreak of PRCA was reported in Thailand in 2011, with 23 cases in 59 990 patient-years' exposure, equivalent to a risk of 1 in 2608 (0.00038). This is substantially higher than the risk reported by Mikhail and Farouk (2013), who estimated that the rate of PRCA with epoetin-alfa Eprex in its original formulation was 1 per 100,000 patient-years' exposure (0.00001), with only three cases reported in the first decade of use. Worryingly, Thai reporters misattributed the problem to 'biosimilar recombinant human erythropoietin', and the misinformation was continued by subsequent editorials and opinion pieces. For example, an editorial in the scientifically respected peer-reviewed journal Kidney International explained ' Biosimilar agents may not undergo the same quality control in their production, packaging, storage, and distribution as their patented competitors. The extensive use of biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agents led to an epidemic of PRCA in Thailand '.

This was based on three factors: the high analytic similarity of biosimilars to originator drugs; no evidence of a difference in drug immunogenicity; and the wealth of clinical trial data available from over a decade of biosimilar use. They further expanded on the explanation as an issue of proportionality of risk - in that patients remaining on one brand of drug would themselves be exposed to 'switching' between different versions of the drug through inherent product drift and step changes in manufacturing processes.",210,40,0.19047619047619047
9781910797693,chp5,The introduction of the biosimilar filgrastim led to a dramatic increase in use whilst realizing cost savings because fewer patients required treatment for neutropenia; it also drove down the price of a long-acting version of filgrastim that was still patent protected.,"Even though biosimilars have relatively high prices compared with small molecule drugs, their introduction has served to improve patient access through the resultant cost savings that can be realized. For example, when the London Medicines Procurement Programme introduced biosimilar versions of filgrastim (recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], a white cell growth factor used to minimize the risk of neutropenia [low neutrophil cell count], and therefore infection, during cancer chemotherapy), the number of patients treated increased five-fold, driven by the lower price compared with the original brand. Despite this dramatic increase in drug volume, however, cost savings were realized through the prevention of neutropenia and the high associated cost of treatment. A similar pattern was seen in Sweden, where a five-fold increase in daily G-CSF usage was matched by 4-5% saving in the total drug budget. When biosimilar filgrastim was introduced in New Zealand in 2012, national audits confirmed both increased patient access and improved outcomes for the overall patient population. While filgrastim was only given to women who had already experienced one episode of neutropenia, filgrastim-Zarzio was also given to women at risk of neutropenia. As a result, the proportion of women receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for breast cancer who experienced neutropenic fever decreased from one-third prior to biosimilars to fewer than 7% with biosimilars. Furthermore, the introduction of filgrastim-Zarzio also drove down the price of pegfilgrastim, a long-acting version of filgrastim that was still on patent.

Whilst epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, and darbepoetin alfa were considered clinically effective in this indication, they were not cost-effective and NICE did not recommend their use in the National Health Service (NHS). However, in a subsequent appraisal in 2014 (TA323), prices were taken from the tender bids placed for contracts to supply epoetins to the London Medicines Procurement Programme; as a result of the competition created by biosimilars, NICE approved use of these drugs in the NHS. This demonstrates the potential effect of biosimilars on the prices of all drugs within the same class: epoetin alfa, epoetin beta and darbepoetin alfa are all epoetins (erythropoiesis stimulating agents) but only biosimilars of epoetin-alfa were available at the time of the second NICE appraisal.",267,26,0.09737827715355805

A hallmark of cancer is that tumor cells - which would normally be recognized by the immune system as abnormal - acquire the ability to evade the immune system. Immuno-oncology is a new, multi-faceted and rapidly evolving collection of treatment strategies aimed at harnessing immune processes to target and destroy tumor cells and prolong survival. An understanding of the basic elements of the normal and tumor-altered immune system is therefore key to understanding potential immuno-oncology therapies. The immune system consists of two components: innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is conferred by mechanisms that are present throughout life, such as the physical barriers to infection provided by the skin and mucous membranes, white blood cells that remove foreign material, and serum proteins such as lysozymes and kinins.

T reg cells regulate the immune response to common environmental allergens and prevent the development of atopy or undesirable inflammation. However, their role in maintenance of peripheral tolerance is also used by cancers to evade the immune system. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (also known as killer T cells) are activated by antigens from intracellular pathogens presented on MHC class I molecules. Activation of these cells triggers a process known as clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells (Teff). These cells recognize cells with a unique MHC class I-antigen complex, and release enzymes and toxins that lyse the cell membrane and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). To prevent extensive tissue damage during an infection, activation of CD8+ cells requires three signals (Figure 1.4). binding of the antigen to the TCR. binding of the MHC class I or II molecules to accessory CD8 or CD4 molecules, respectively, on the T cell. co-regulatory (co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory) signals resulting from binding of CD80 (B7-1) and CD28 on the APC and T cell: binding of CD80 (B7-1) on the APC to T cell CD28 leads to a positive signal, causing the T cell to kill cells bearing the relevant antigen, whereas binding of CD80 (B7-1) on the APC to CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) on the T cell results in a negative signal, preventing the T cell from killing antigen-bearing cells. Humoral immunity involves the production in B cells of antibodies (immunoglobulins) against specific antigens. In contrast to T cells, where the antigen is processed intracellularly before being expressed on the cell surface in association with MHC molecules, B cells recognize the native, unprocessed, form of the antigen. The B cell receptor (BCR) consists of an antibody that recognizes a specific antigen. Upon activation by binding of the antigen to the BCR, B cells differentiate into short-lived antibody-producing cells (plasma cells) (Figure 1.5). The antibodies bind to the antigen, rendering it more susceptible to phagocytosis and triggering the complement system. Once the antigen has been cleared, the plasma cells are eliminated via programmed cell death (apoptosis). However, approximately 10% of activated B cells differentiate into long-lived antigen-specific memory B cells (see Figure 1.5); this allows a rapid immune response to be mounted in the event of re-exposure to the antigen.",595,125,0.21008403361344538

The history of immuno-oncology. The concept of immuno-oncology dates back more than 100 years, to 1893 (Figure 3.1).

However, it was not until the mid-20th century when Lewis Thomas and Frank MacFarlane Burnet hypothesized that the immune system is capable of eliminating cancerous cells through a process known as immune surveillance, and that this process depends on recognition of tumor-associated antigens by the immune system., Subsequently, through the laboratory work of Lloyd Old and Robert Schreiber, the concept of immune surveillance has evolved into 'immunoediting', reflecting the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. Increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of immunoediting has identified numerous potential therapeutic targets, some of which - notably immune checkpoint inhibition as first demonstrated by James Allison in the 1990s - are already yielding promising results in clinical practice., Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science.",300,16,0.05333333333333334

The precursors of fully differentiated neutrophils and erythrocytes bear intermediate properties between the final cells and the HSCs. They have an increasingly restricted developmental potential as they complete their development. Traditionally, these precursor cells have been identified by labeling cell surface markers with antibodies conjugated to fluorescent proteins, which can then be identified by flow cytometry. Cells sorted on the basis of these cell surface markers have been transplanted into irradiated mice, and only specific populations of cells have been found to develop from them. For example, when common lymphoid progenitors are transplanted into irradiated mice, they give rise only to lymphocytes (Figure 1.2a).

Cytokines provide a signal to cells to proliferate and differentiate. For example, dormant HSCs can be stimulated by the cytokine interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) to produce more proliferative oligopotent stem cells that can differentiate into other cells such as neutrophils. Other cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), drive differentiation of progenitor cells into neutrophils and monocytes. Permissive versus instructive signaling. An ongoing debate on the role of cytokine signaling is whether cytokines merely provide a permissive environment for HSCs to differentiate into a specific role (permissive model) or have a more direct role, driving the HSCs down a specific differentiation lineage (instructive model).",187,36,0.1925133689839572

Transcription factors are vital in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Evidence for this is seen through the disruption of hematopoiesis in both mouse models and in familial patterns of disease. Hematopoietic cells are exquisitely sensitive to subtle variations in expression levels of transcription factors. For example, a simple twofold increase in the levels of the transcription factor GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) blocks differentiation of hematopoietic cells in mice. Powerful experimental data also show the ability of ectopically expressed transcription factors to transdifferentiate committed hematopoietic cells into different lineages (Figure 1.3).",145,17,0.11724137931034483

There are two main staging systems for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The Rai staging system divides the disease into five stages; it is most often used in the USA. The Binet staging system divides the disease into three stages and is the preferred system in Europe (Table 5.5). CLL is an extremely heterogeneous disease, with certain subsets of patients having survival rates without treatment that are similar to the normal population.

The increased incidence of thromboses in patients with ALL (5% in children and higher in adults) is likely to be linked to the use of L -asparaginase, as thromboses are not as strongly associated with regimens that do not contain this agent. Thromboses most frequently occur in the venous system, including critical sites such as the cerebral venous sinuses and pulmonary vessels. The mechanism of action underlying this increase in thromboses is multifactorial, including disruption of natural anticoagulants and activation of the coagulation cascade. L -asparaginase is particularly associated with a decrease in antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant that inhibits activated coagulation factors. Given the resultant prothrombotic state, which is worse during the initial stages of treatment, placement of central venous catheters should be avoided during induction treatment, as these may be a source of thromboses. The management of thromboses is predominantly based on the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). However, as the anticoagulant mechanism of LMWH is dependent on antithrombin, the levels of which are affected by L-asparaginase, some clinicians also advocate the use of antithrombin infusions or other replacement products.",320,65,0.203125

These terms are explained later in this chapter, but 'ALS' serves well as the single unifying term for what is now understood to be a multisystem, clinically heterogeneous syndrome that overlaps pathologically and genetically with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In relation to the most obvious symptom, ALS has understandably found itself historically classified among the neuromuscular disorders. However, for clinical, histopathological and genetic reasons, it is now more rationally considered alongside the cerebral neurodegenerative disorders (Figure 1.1).",164,26,0.15853658536585366

The site of onset and pattern of spread of weakness in ALS varies but is not random. It reflects dysfunction of a broader corticomotoneuronal system that encompasses the traditional nomenclature of upper motor neurons (UMNs) of the corticospinal tract and lower motor neurons (LMNs) arising from differentially vulnerable brainstem nuclei and the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord.,104,16,0.15384615384615385

These cases have a profoundly different natural history of very slowly progressive weakness that may not be life shortening. Post mortem histopathology (and modern neuroimaging) of PLS has frequently demonstrated severe 'knife-edge' atrophy of the primary motor cortex. In contrast, and despite the more aggressive course and higher level of physical disability, ALS cases typically demonstrate limited macroscopic atrophy of the brain. Only a few cases of PLS have been examined using modern molecular histopathological phenotyping, with inconsistent reporting of the ALS-defining signature of cellular inclusions of transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43). Thus, unlike so-called PMA, justifiable debate persists as to whether PLS is part of the ALS spectrum; however, given the rarity of PLS compared to UMN-predominant forms of ALS (see below), this is not a major issue in clinical practice.",225,45,0.2

Individuals with ALS are strikingly able to define the timing and site of onset of their first symptoms (Table 1.2). The initial site of symptom onset typically retains the highest burden of progressive disability. Limb weakness tends to spread contiguously (contra- versus ipsilaterally).,66,14,0.21212121212121213
9781912776139,ch1,Variation in the speed of symptom progression is not closely tied to any single phenotypic classifier.,"Stratification by rate of progression. The major limitation of a unified TDP-43-based approach to the classification of ALS is the anatomic disconnection between the range of clinical phenotypes and rates of progression. Indeed, a common theme across all the ALS taxonomic systems discussed above is the strikingly slower-than-average rates of progression found in certain variants. For example, the bulbar onset of symptoms is under-represented among individuals with younger-onset disease. The molecular underpinnings for this remain obscure. Given that molecular taxonomies of ALS transcend or confound attempts to produce clinical criteria for these variants, supports the view that ALS is more usefully stratified in terms of rate of symptom progression rather than variable sites and patterns of symptom onset and spread. It is also one of the appealing aspects of a clinical staging approach to ALS akin to that in cancer (Table 1.3).",184,21,0.11413043478260869

The annual incidence of ALS is 1-3 per 100 000, with a prevalence of 4-6 per 100 000 that equates to approximately 15 000 and 5000 cases in the USA and UK, respectively, at any given time.

It is therefore unsurprising that viable mutations of the parent gene represent fewer than 0.5% of all cases of ALS.

The weakness is often asymmetric.,"The characteristic history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of often insidious, yet always progressive, asymmetric weakness without prominent sensory symptoms. The most common complaints are of a weakness in one arm or leg, or a change in the voice. Individuals are often able to date the onset of symptoms to a specific month. While individuals often try to associate the onset of symptoms with other events (exempli gratia a viral infection or surgery), there is no firm epidemiological evidence to support a consistent trigger in this regard.

Despite this assertion, they rarely seek acute services, unlike those who have a stroke, even though such individuals are frequently, and erroneously, referred for assessment as such. The history of progressive weakening is critical. In the early stages, symptoms may fluctuate from day to day or week to week. More rarely, an individual with ALS will report transient remission of weakness. In these cases, it is important to consider the broader overall trajectory of the condition to establish the clear presence of progression of weakness.

There may be pseudobulbar affect (emotional lability), dysphagia and a hyperactive gag response.","Atrophy can be best observed by comparing muscles side by side and looking for asymmetry, which is the more common pattern in ALS. The lateral intrinsic hand muscles, especially the first dorsal interossei, are typically more affected than the medial ones. This so-called 'split hand' in ALS is not easily explained in terms of peripheral or proximal limb innervation and may instead reflect the cortical organization associated with the uniquely opposable thumb in humans, or selective involvement of motor neuronal pools in the anterior horns of the cervical spinal cord (Figure 3.1). The tongue, quadriceps, tibialis anterior and calf muscles are also frequently affected by visible atrophy. Tongue atrophy in ALS is invariably symmetric (unlike atrophy in the limbs) (Figure 3.2). Fasciculation may be missed unless the individual is undressed to expose the upper chest, back and proximal arms and legs (see Case report 3.1). Individuals with ALS usually do not report fasciculation (unlike those with benign fasciculation). Fasciculation in the tongue can be difficult to distinguish from brief semi-voluntary movements, exaggerated by protrusion. It is best appreciated with the tongue relaxed, resting in the floor of the mouth, with the mouth gently opened. Muscle tone is reduced in LMN disease. This is not commonly a useful sign, as it only becomes apparent when weakness is advanced. Conversely, the increased tone seen in UMN disorders may be detectable before any weakness becomes apparent. 'Clasp-knife' spasticity may occur and there may be clonus, commonly at the ankles and, more rarely, at the jaw and occasionally at the patella or forearm.

However, most of the development of biomarkers to date has used healthy controls as the comparator. The distinction of ALS from healthy is not the clinical question facing the physician. Furthermore, the rarity of ALS and its essentially sporadic nature sets the bar extremely high for a diagnostic test that can be applied in the primary care setting. Prospective application of existing biomarker candidates within a specialized clinical setting is required to ensure that they add value to the diagnostic process.

Both neurofilament light chain (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) are structural proteins released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and thence to the peripheral blood in a wide range of pathological states that involve axonal breakdown, including ALS. They are relatively stable in biofluids and are easily detected by antibody-based immunoassays. Multiple studies have demonstrated higher CSF NfL and pNfH levels in patients with ALS than in healthy controls and, increasingly, also disease controls.

Conduction originates with self-excitation of the sinoatrial (SA) node, which lies at the junction of the superior vena cava with the upper part of the right atrium. The SA node acts as the heart's pacemaker. A depolarization wavefront spreads down from the SA node to the base of the right atrium and simultaneously spreads to the left atrium over a band of muscle (Bachmann's bundle). The complete depolarization of the atria gives rise to the P wave on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG; see Figure 1.1). A normal P wave is less than 200 ms wide and smaller than 1 mV in amplitude. It has a low amplitude because the mass of the atria is considerably smaller than that of the ventricles, and it is wide because most of the depolarization of the atria occurs by relatively slow cell-to-cell conduction.",378,56,0.14814814814814814

The heart rate required to produce Wenckebach block decreases with age: for example, at 20-40 years of age, Wenckebach block occurs at 160-180 bpm, whereas over 70 years of age it occurs at approximately 120 bpm. Despite this relative slowing effect, it is still possible to maintain very rapid heart rates during tachycardia, emphasizing how complex conduction within the heart can be.

9781912776153,chp1,Autonomic effects on the heart (sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli) can significantly influence cardiac conduction.,"Although the heart muscle has intrinsic rhythmicity, an individual's heart rate is influenced by outside factors and can vary widely during the day, reflecting the relative balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The heart rate often varies with respiration, speeding up with inspiration and slowing with expiration. This is referred to as a sinus arrhythmia and is normal, particularly in young people (less than 40 years of age). In the 'flight or fight' response to danger, the sympathetic system activates the adrenal glands and releases epinephrine (adrenaline) into the circulation. This stimulates cardiac beta-adrenoreceptors, generally increasing cardiac conduction, heart rate and the force of contraction. Conversely, the parasympathetic system, via the vagus nerve, has a dampening effect, reducing the heart rate and force of contraction. Intracardiac conduction is slowed and, in certain patients, AV nodal conduction can be slowed significantly. Maneuvers that provoke a vagal response, such as carotid sinus massage or vomiting, may terminate arrhythmias that use the AV node as part of their mechanism (exempli gratia many supraventricular tachycardias; SVTs). Profound vagal activation usually produces a specific sequence of prodromal symptoms: for 1-2 minutes patients complain of feeling light-headed and nauseous, followed by sweating and worsening nausea; they may ultimately lose consciousness as a result of severe bradycardias or hypotension. Other factors such as thyroid hormones and pregnancy also affect heart rate.",325,24,0.07384615384615385

9781912776153,chp1,The substrate for an arrhythmia is an abnormal electrical pathway or a region of scarred myocardium. The trigger is an atrial or ventricular ectopic beat.,"During sinus rhythm the impulse spreads from the SA node in its usual manner and depolarizes both atria. Conduction is slowed through the AV node as normal, but it is not slowed through the accessory pathway. The impulse from the atria is therefore partly conducted to the ventricles via this route rather than only through the AV node and His-Purkinje system. This allows part of the ventricle to depolarize before it would otherwise do so (overt pre-excitation), resulting in a diagnostic abnormality on the surface ECG - fusion of the P wave with the initial part of the QRS complex, demonstrating depolarization from both normal AV node conduction and through the accessory pathway (Figure 1.4). This slurring of the upstroke of the initial part of the QRS deflection, called a delta wave, causes the QRS to be wider than normal. It can sometimes be confused with the appearance of bundle branch block, which also causes a broadening of the QRS because of abnormal depolarization of the ventricles. The delta wave vector can be used to determine the position of the accessory pathways. Sustained arrhythmia in WPW syndrome requires both an accessory pathway (the substrate) and a trigger, which is almost always an ectopic beat, either atrial or ventricular. These ectopic beats need to be critically timed in order to initiate the arrhythmia (Figure 1.5). The fact that people with accessory pathways have arrhythmias only now and again emphasizes the relative infrequency at which an ectopic beat falls at the critical time to allow the arrhythmia to start.",342,36,0.10526315789473684

Disease rarity poses significant challenges, however. International collaboration, for example through the International Rare Cancer Initiative, will be essential to deliver practice-changing clinical trials for specific PTCL subtypes. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy represents a novel treatment strategy that may prove transformative across PTCL subtypes, as in other hematologic malignancies. Peripheral blood T cells apheresed from patients are engineered to express a modified antigen receptor that recognizes a cancer target (Figure 8.2). They are then reinfused. Upon engagement with the target cell, activation of CAR T cells triggers cytotoxicity of the cancer cell. This process is illustrated in Figure 8.3. CAR T cells have been developed for CD4, CD5, CD7 and CD30. However, some of these pan T-cell markers risk causing profound immunosuppression. An alternative approach is to develop CAR products against the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRB). Peripheral T cells express two isoforms, TCRB1 and TCRB2, broadly evenly, but PTCL is clonally either TCRB1 or TCRB2. CAR products against these TCRB isoforms would therefore ensure that approximately half of the normal T-cell repertoire is preserved.",363,71,0.19559228650137742

Unlike a typical two-arm confirmatory clinical study, patients were randomized into four arms. Blood counts and toxicity could be compared between 192 patients split evenly into two groups on cycle 1. The first cycle of chemotherapy is typically the most sensitive to neutropenic fever, so this represents the best pharmacodynamic endpoint for discovering any clinical difference between the two versions of filgrastim. Over the full six cycles of the trial, there is a second potential comparison of efficacy and toxicity for both brands. This increases the total events studied, giving additional efficacy and safety data. The third comparison is between the 96 patients in arms 1 and 4 who remain on the same brand of filgrastim through chemotherapy and the 96 patients in arms 2 and 3, who switch brands on each alternate chemotherapy cycle; this explores whether brand switching leads to loss of efficacy or increased toxicity (especially immunogenicity), and anticipated the US regulator's requirement for clinical data to support a further label as an 'interchangeable biosimilar'.",327,45,0.13761467889908258

Bevacizumab is very similar to ranibizumab, another inhibitor of VEGF, which is licensed for the treatment of wet ARMD. As the cost per injection of bevacizumab for ARMD is about 12 times lower than that for ranibizumab, there is significant unlicensed use of bevacizumab in this indication. This off-label use is not without evidence: it is supported by clinical outcome data from the 2-year Comparison of wet-AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) in the USA (results published in 2012), the Inhibition of VEGF in Age-related Choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) trial in the UK (2013) and a Cochrane review, which concluded that bevacizumab and ranibizumab were equally effective.

It can be argued that the eye is an immune-privileged site, such that anti-drug antibodies are unlikely to be a problem; however, ocular immune privilege is not absolute and its mechanisms are still not completely understood.

In addition, the antipsychotic effect of clozapine in patients with PDP occurs at such low doses that binding to the limbic D2 receptors is unlikely to be the mechanism by which psychotic symptoms improve; the blocking of 5HT2A receptors is a more likely explanation. These hypotheses have led to the search for drugs that specifically target the 5HT2A receptor only. Mechanism of action.

Having considered the dependence of an outcome (time to disease progression) on a single baseline factor (size of primary tumor at baseline), this approach can be extended to look simultaneously at the dependence on multiple baseline factors. Although it is not possible to draw this as in Figures 6.1-6.3, the simple regression equation can be extended to a multiple regression equation by including additional x variables. For example, evaluating the dependence of time to disease progression (y) on three baseline factors rather than one: size of primary tumor (x), age (x) and sex (x).

For example, age and size of primary tumor may be correlated, with older patients generally presenting with larger tumors. A simple regression analysis, with age as the single baseline factor, could well give a significant p -value suggesting a dependence, but this would be misleading. It is not age that drives outcome: age is correlated with the size of primary tumor and it is the size of the primary tumor that determines outcome. The only way to ensure this correlation is accounted for is to include all variables simultaneously in a multiple regression analysis.

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is used to compare treatment groups while accounting for baseline imbalances. It is an extension of the ANOVA introduced earlier. Figure 6.4 is a scatter plot showing the relationship between time to disease progression and the size of the primary tumor (the covariate) in two groups (active treatment versus control [placebo]), each comprising 20 subjects. In this instance, a simple comparison of mean time to disease progression in the active treatment group versus the mean time to disease progression in the control group, ignoring the role of size of primary tumor, would be a perfectly valid approach. However, it would not be especially sensitive as those means would not be that different. As can be seen in Figure 6.4, there are patients in the active treatment group with large tumors whose outcomes are poor (time to disease progression of 15 months or less). There are also patients in the control group who are doing well (time to disease progression of over 20 months).

This would show as a plateauing of the data and would violate the assumption of linearity. ANOVA, on the other hand, makes no assumptions regarding the underlying relationship between tumor size and time to disease progression and for that reason could be the preferred approach under some circumstances.

It is increasingly apparent that diffuse infiltrating gliomas may not have high-grade features when diagnosed early.

Thus, a method has been developed that looks at epigenetic changes caused by a combination of mutations and the cell of origin. These epigenetic changes are identified from methylation patterns (which are a result of driver mutations), using a publicly accessible algorithm (www.molecularneuropathology.org). This method is widely used in the diagnosis of brain tumors with unusual or ambiguous histology and when conventional molecular testing is not diagnostically informative.

A problematic issue is the overlap that exists between structural and advanced imaging features of viable tumor and necrotic tissue. On conventional MRI sequences, the early (pseudoprogression; Figure 4.2) and late (radiation necrosis) effects of adjuvant therapy are often indistinguishable from a growing tumor, as both may appear as new or enlarging enhancing lesions due to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The true incidence of therapy effects is debatable, as it depends on the definition of a progressive lesion. This complexity is acknowledged in the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, which take into consideration the timing of adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma serial monitoring. To date, the challenge of distinguishing between glioblastoma recurrence and therapy effects has not been completely resolved, not least because the two may coexist. However, several advanced imaging techniques are valuable in this context. Perfusion MRI can help to identify neovascular (viable) tumor (Figure 4.3), but difficulty may arise from intermediate values, and short-interval monitoring may be necessary unless a histological diagnosis is pursued.",359,70,0.19498607242339833

Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults but the prognosis with the current standard of care (see Chapter 4) remains poor, and novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Selective targeting of oncogenic mutations has transformed the therapeutic landscape in many solid and hematologic cancers but has yet to be exploited in glioblastoma. The need to penetrate the blood-brain barrier represents an additional challenge in this tumor type. This chapter discusses some potential novel therapeutic targets and describes how the IDH and BRAF mutations discussed in Chapter 1 are being targeted. Immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and dendritic cell vaccination, as well as marizomib, a novel, irreversible and brain-penetrant pan-proteasome inhibitor, are also being evaluated in gliomas. Researchers are also examining the potential of immunosuppressive gene therapy and tumor-treating fields. IDH inhibitors. Mutations in the IDH gene result in the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which induces epigenetic alterations such as DNA global and histone methylation (see page 11). Isoform-selective IDH inhibitors have been developed to suppress production of 2HG. Ivosidenib is a small-molecule inhibitor of IDH that is already approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

The final survival results of a large Phase III trial are awaited.,"Dendritic cell immunotherapy is designed to enhance the individual's immune response to overcome tumor-derived immunosuppression. The vaccine contains the patient's own dendritic cells, pulsed with the patient's tumor lysate or peptides (obtained during surgical resection). Once the vaccine has been administered back to the patient, intradermally or subcutaneously, it activates T cells to cross the blood-brain barrier and target glioblastoma cells. Vaccination-related side effects include redness and itching at the site of injection. Serious adverse events such as neurotoxicity have been rare. An autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine is being trialed across 80 centers in four countries in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. All enrolled patients underwent surgery and standard of care chemoradiotherapy (see page 47) before receiving the vaccine (n > 232) or placebo (n > 99). Patients in both arms have continued to receive adjuvant temozolomide, and the vaccine or placebo has been administered by intradermal injection in the arm on days 0, 10 and 20, then months 2, 4, 8 and 12 and every 6 months thereafter (id est six times in year 1 and twice per year thereafter).

The most common presentation of acute TTP is a previously healthy young to middle-aged adult with MAHA, severe thrombocytopenia and features of end-organ damage. There is a consensus that overall women are roughly twice as commonly affected by TTP as men, though Japanese data are unusual in showing a 1:1 ratio. There are a large variety of possible presenting symptoms, which can be categorized into those resulting from: (1) MAHA; (2) thrombocytopenia; (3) end-organ microvascular thrombosis; and (4) other (Figure 2.1).

Non-specific symptoms such as malaise, fatigue and weakness are common, and a non-specific prodrome may often precede the onset of the more specific features of hemolysis, thrombocytopenia or end-organ damage. In terms of end-organ manifestations, neurological symptoms appear to be the most predominant according to the published data, though these can be as subtle as headache and mild cognitive impairment.

However, prophylactic treatment in known cases of cTTP and close monitoring in women who have previously had an episode of iTTP can vastly improve fetal outcomes. Differential diagnosis.

A more accurate classification came about after better understanding of the pathophysiology that underpins a division into HUS (endothelial injury mediated by Shiga toxin) and secondary HUS or TMAs. Causes of secondary TMAs include severe infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, HIV infection, drug toxicity (especially in people with cancer or following solid-organ transplant) and, rarely, autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

It can occur at any age, but it usually affects children younger than 5 years. It can occur sporadically or as an epidemic and is associated with ingestion of contaminated food or water. STEC colonizes the gut, damages the epithelium and secretes Shiga toxin (Stx), which gets delivered to target organs. The tendency to cause renal failure lies in the fact that renal cells have a surface rich in globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), which binds the pentameric B subunit of Stx. Stx is then endocytosed, its A subunit is released and apoptotic cell death occurs. Patients usually develop abdominal pain, diarrhea (often bloody), followed by an acute TMA and renal injury within 5-13 days after the onset of diarrhea. The TMA most commonly follows recovery from the acute diarrheal illness. ADAMTS13 levels should be normal in these cases. STEC can be recovered by culturing stool on selective media or it can be diagnosed through serologic testing. Treatment is usually supportive and includes intravenous fluids and transfusion support.

9781912776818,hh-7,"In patients presenting with a clinical picture consistent with an acute episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), plasma exchange should be started empirically before the diagnosis is confirmed by ADAMTS13 activity testing.","Once a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is strongly suspected, treatment must be initiated as soon as possible. Delays in initiating treatment have been associated with early mortality. Therefore, the initial management for a patient with suspected TTP will typically involve empiric plasma exchange therapy, which should usually be started before the diagnosis is confirmed. Plasma exchange therapy. The introduction of plasma exchange therapy revolutionized the treatment of TTP. It remains the mainstay of acute TTP treatment. Nearly 90% of patients will survive an acute TTP episode with plasma exchange therapy whereas, in contrast, there was near uniform mortality prior to the discovery of its effectiveness in TTP. Because of this, it is imperative to start plasma exchange as soon as possible. It is hypothesized that plasma exchange works via repletion of the ADAMTS13 protease and/or the removal of the pathologic autoantibodies that inhibit ADAMTS13 function. The volume of exchange and replacement fluid used for the exchange can vary by institution, and it is not clear if there are material differences between replacement products. In general, in the acute phase, plasma exchange should be performed daily, with 1 to 1.5 plasma volume exchanges for the first few days; some centers use higher volume exchanges (1.5 plasma volume) for the initial days before dropping to one plasma volume exchanges thereafter for patients with a more severe presentation. For refractory or resistant cases, twice-daily exchanges can be considered, but this approach is less well supported by evidence.",320,50,0.15625

By binding to VWF, caplacizumab blocks the ability of VWF to bind platelets, inhibiting the formation of microthrombi in TTP. It has no effect on the formation of autoantibodies to ADAMTS13. Caplacizumab was approved by both European Union and US regulatory authorities for the treatment of TTP in conjunction with plasma exchange and immune suppression. Trials have demonstrated a faster platelet response, but, more importantly, caplacizumab has been shown to significantly decrease the exacerbation rate (recurrence of TTP in the first month after stopping plasma exchange) after the acute TTP episode.

9783318066241,ch1,Initial acinar cell injury has several cellular consequences that promote local inflammation.,"Acinar and ductal secretion is controlled by complex neural (vagal innervation) and endocrine (cholecystokinin, secretin) regulation. Endocrine cells (clustered into the islets of Langerhans) are scattered along the exocrine tissue, and hormones such as insulin interact with acinar cells to further regulate exocrine secretion. The etiology of AP is discussed in detail in Chapter 2. However, the initial step in the pathogenesis of AP is acinar cell injury, which has several important consequences (Figure 1.3).",116,14,0.1206896551724138

Infection is the consequence of early bacterial translocation due to a loss of the barrier function of the bowel: bacteria reach regional lymph nodes, the splanchnic vein system and then the necrotic tissue. Necrotizing pancreatitis (pancreatic gland and/or peripancreatic fat necrosis) is also associated with a higher risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome leading to organ failure due to uncontrolled and unbalanced release of proinflammatory mediators.

In 1996, the first genetic mutation leading to pancreatitis was described by David C. Whitcomb. In that landmark paper, Whitcomb described an Arg-His substitution at residue 117 of the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1), which was associated with hereditary pancreatitis. Other mutations associated with pancreatitis have been described subsequently. Mutations in PRSS1 may promote autoactivation by direct or indirect (exempli gratia by making the trypsinogen molecule more resistant to degradation) mechanisms. PRSS1 mutations cause an autosomal dominant form of hereditary pancreatitis. Patients with hereditary pancreatitis due to PRSS1 mutations have an increased risk of pancreatitis during childhood, quick progression to chronic pancreatitis and a high probability of developing pancreatic cancer. PRSS1 mutations are very uncommon, and should be suspected in idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis starting in childhood (median age 10 years).

These studies suggested that vigorous resuscitation is dangerous in patients with severe AP. The studies had some flaws, including being open-label single-center RCTs, with suboptimal randomization, an unexpectedly high rate of sepsis in patients with aggressive resuscitation and large differences in mortality between treatment groups despite a very small sample of patients, and they require validation.",261,21,0.08045977011494253

Both an open-label and a triple-blind RCT have demonstrated that fluid resuscitation using lactated Ringer's solution (a balanced salt solution) is associated with a decreased inflammatory response when compared with fluid resuscitation with normal saline (with a high chloride content). According to in vitro experiments, it seems that this anti-inflammatory effect depends on lactate. However, both studies included a small number of patients, and the influence of lactated Ringer's solution on important outcomes such as OF or mortality is unknown. In studies addressing other clinical scenarios, balanced fluids such as lactated Ringer's solution seem to be associated with a decreased need for blood products and a lower incidence of renal replacement therapy, hyperkalemia and postoperative infections when compared with normal saline. For the time being, it seems that lactated Ringer's solution is a good choice for fluid resuscitation in AP.",186,22,0.11827956989247312
9783318066241,ch6,Oral refeeding when abdominal pain subsides is recommended in all patients with pancreatitis. Tube feeding (either nasogastric or nasojejunal) is indicated from the fourth day when oral refeeding is not tolerated or the patient is sedated.,"However, placement of a nasojejunal tube is not easy, it is time-consuming and results in great patient discomfort. Furthermore, it has been shown that standard nasojejunal feeding does in fact stimulate pancreatic secretion. Three studies comparing a nasogastric versus a nasojejunal route found no difference in outcomes, so both feeding routes can be recommended, depending on the presence or absence of gastric outlet obstruction. In 2014, the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group published an RCT in patients with predicted severe AP which compared early (within 24 hours) nasojejunal enteral nutrition versus on-demand nasojejunal enteral nutrition (the patients tried oral refeeding on the third day and enteral nutrition was given on the fourth day only to those who could not tolerate oral feeding). The study showed that on-demand oral feeding was not associated with worse outcomes, and only 31% of patients needed a nasojejunal tube. Overall, therefore, in patients with moderate-to-severe AP, oral refeeding on day 3 to 4 should be encouraged and nasogastric or nasojejunal tube feeding from day 4 should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate oral refeeding or who are sedated. The nasojejunal route is indicated in patients with gastric outlet obstruction.",279,55,0.1971326164874552

The first single-center RCTs suggested a benefit for early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in AP, but later, better designed RCTs which excluded patients with acute cholangitis, showed that regardless of severity and the presence of choledocholithiasis, patients undergoing ERCP within the first 72 hours do not have better outcomes., Patients with AP and acute cholangitis may benefit from early ERCP, as the first studies (those showing better outcomes for early ERCP) included patients with this complication.

9783318066241,ch7,Sterile symptomatic collections are mostly managed non-invasively. Drainage is indicated in infected collections or in symptomatic sterile collections that persist despite initial conservative treatment.,"Indications for drainage. Generally speaking, sterile symptomatic collections can be managed conservatively. Only 1 in 10 patients or fewer with sterile necrotic collections require drainage due to symptoms, compared with almost all patients with IPN (see Table 7.1). Recent European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines on endoscopic management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis suggest considering an invasive intervention after conservative treatment fails in patients with sterile necrosis and adjacent organ compression or persistent pain late in the course of the disease. The method for draining the collection, once the decision is taken, is similar to that for IPN (see Figure 7.5). Previously, FNA for Gram stain and culture was widely used to confirm IPN, as the treatment of choice was necrosectomy, a major and aggressive open surgical intervention. Now, minimally invasive methods for drainage are available, so obtaining a definitive diagnosis is less important. The ESGE guidelines recommend against routine percutaneous FNA in patients with suspected IPN, stating that its use should be restricted to cases with a suspicion of infection but with unclear clinical/imaging signs. In most cases direct drainage for diagnosis and treatment is encouraged when IPN is suspected and other sources of infection (central-line infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, Clostridium difficile infection, etc.) have been ruled out.",282,35,0.12411347517730496

Before 2010, the standard treatment of necrotic collections (all IPNs and those symptomatic collections refractory to conservative treatment) was open necrosectomy. A series of studies performed by the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group shifted this towards a minimally invasive approach. In 2010, the group published a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a step-up approach versus open necrosectomy for patients with IPN. The step-up approach comprised a first step of percutaneous or endoscopic transgastric drainage. The preferred route was through the left retroperitoneum, thereby facilitating minimally invasive retroperitoneal necrosectomy at a later stage, if necessary. If there was no clinical improvement after 72 hours and if the position of the drain (or drains) was inadequate or other fluid collections could be drained, a second drainage procedure was performed. If the second drainage procedure was not possible, or if there was no clinical improvement after an additional 72 hours, the second step, VARD with postoperative lavage, was performed.

These factors increase IAP and may result in intra-abdominal hypertension (a sustained IAP >= 12 mmHg). Patients with intra-abdominal hypertension are at risk of developing organ failure (OF), as increased pressure in the abdomen may collapse blood vessels, resulting in gastrointestinal tract and kidney ischemia and decreased cardiac output.

Viral particles carry surface proteins that interact with particular receptors on target cells to trigger endocytotic uptake. Following endosomal trafficking, DNA is delivered into the nucleus for viral gene expression. Viral vector genome engineering involves replacing infectious viral genes with a therapeutic gene cassette, while retaining the signal sequences required for in vitro replication and packaging into producer cell lines. The most widely used viral vectors for preclinical and clinical gene therapy purposes are based on gammaretrovirus, lentivirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV).

Over the years, major concerns about gene therapy included the (at least theoretical) possibility of germline transmission, the potential for severe immunotoxicities and the risk of insertional mutagenesis, among others. Conversely, the scientific and medical community's understanding of the risks related to gene transfer in patients has grown substantially over the past three decades and there is now a wealth of clinical trial and animal data. Senior leaders of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the NIH recently concluded that the risks of gene therapy should no longer be viewed as unique or unpredictable.

It was reasoned that introducing this gene to HSCs should provide a selective advantage for gene-corrected cells, thus reconstituting the immune system without the need for a conditioning regimen. Two initial clinical trials in France and the UK utilized a gammaretroviral vector with long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven expression of the transgene for transduction of autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells. Following cell transplant to a total of 20 infants, the clinical outcome was remarkable. Two decades later, 18 of the 20 patients are alive and still show full or nearly full correction of T-cell immunodeficiency. However, six patients developed T-cell leukemia between 2.5 and 15 years after the cell transplant. While most patients were successfully treated with chemotherapy, one patient died as a result of the leukemia. Retroviral integration had caused the activation of proto-oncogenes such as LMO2.

Gene editing in embryos could theoretically be used to correct genetic defects, thus eliminating them not only from this individual but also from future generations, or to genetically 'enhance' people. These questions have sparked an ongoing ethical discussion and require answers not only from doctors and scientists but from society as a whole. The prevailing opinion among scientists is that, at least at the moment, there are too many question marks to even consider germline gene therapy until technologies are further developed and more experience with somatic gene editing has been obtained. Nonetheless, a claim was made by a scientist in China in late 2018 that two twin girls were gene edited to become resistant to HIV infection. Although it is not entirely clear that gene editing was indeed achieved, calls for global cooperation and oversight have been made.

Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach.","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes death in infants. Loss of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle wasting, initially affecting arm, leg and respiratory muscles. The disease is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which is autosomal recessive and encodes survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (SMN1), a protein necessary for motor neuron survival. The SMN1 protein is important for the biogenesis and assembly of small nuclear ribonucleic particles (snRNPs), which are critical in messenger (m)RNA splicing (spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing). While SMN1 is ubiquitously expressed, its loss is particularly detrimental to motor neurons. Without functional motor neurons, the central nervous system (CNS) is unable to send signals to skeletal muscles, and babies born with this defect gradually become paralyzed. To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1. This vector is capable of transducing motor neurons and effectively transduces the spinal cord after systemic administration. Moreover, it is also able to cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce cells in the brains of rhesus macaques, even in animals up to 3 years old. Nonetheless, it is thought that the most effective reversal of disease can be achieved early in life. Remarkably, all 15 babies treated by this gene therapy in the initial clinical trial are alive at age 20 months or older (these patients were expected to die within the first 2 years of life). Most can sit up, and some are even able to walk. The FDA has approved the systemic AAV gene therapy for SMN1-deficient children up to the age of 2 years.",369,52,0.14092140921409213

These are now being evaluated in Phase III trials.","After preclinical efficacy and long-term follow-up studies in hemophilic mice and dogs and in non-human primates, followed by a series of early Phase I/II clinical trials and further preclinical development, there are now several AAV vectors in advanced clinical development for hemophilia. They all utilize hepatocyte-specific promoters but differ in capsid and also utilize different methods for vector production (such as transient transfection of human cells or baculovirus infection of insect cells). For FIX production, efficacy has been further improved by incorporation of a naturally occurring variant (FIX-Padua) that has an approximately eightfold higher enzymatic activity. Such vectors raised coagulation activity in patients with severe disease to around 30-50% of usual levels, close to the lower limit of the normal range. Thus, patients typically no longer require factor infusions, and dramatic reductions in annual bleeding rates (mostly none) are reported. These therapeutic benefits have persisted for at least 3 years, with more follow-up data pending. Notably, patients treated in an earlier trial with an AAV vector expressing FIX without the Padua mutation reached levels above 5% of normal that were sustained for at least 8 years.

Of fundamental importance to the genome editing discipline is the discovery that endogenous DNA repair machinery can be stimulated by the directed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Once made, DSBs activate one of the host cell's two main DNA repair systems: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed recombination (HDR) (Figure 5.1). The NHEJ pathway operates throughout the cell cycle and repairs DSBs without a template via the typically imprecise direct ligation of broken strand ends. As NHEJ is prone to error, small insertions or deletions (indels) are introduced into the genomic sequence at the DSB site. In contrast, HDR machinery operates mainly during the S and G2 cell cycle phases, utilizes a donor template with homology sequences to DSB sites, which is naturally the sister chromatid, and directs efficient site-specific strand exchange and repair.",224,55,0.24553571428571427

Individual TALEs recognize DNA bases with a simple one-to-one cipher determining binding specificity - one type of TALE binds to only one DNA base. Each highly conserved TALE repeat binds a specific single DNA base pair, with two hypervariable amino acid residues conveying specificity. Four TALEs specific to different DNA bases can be coupled together in various orders to target diverse but particular DNA sequences. On this basis, novel DNA-binding proteins, with custom DNA-binding specificity, have been engineered by linking modular TALE repeats into long arrays. Subsequently, as with ZFs, TALEs have been fused to the Fok l restriction endonuclease domain, generating programmable TALENs that function as pairs for the introduction of DSBs. The TALENs system can be 'programmed' by engineering the TALE repeat sequence-specific targeting region. TALENs have been used to efficiently trigger both the NHEJ and HDR pathways in human cells. Perhaps the main strength of the TALENs platform is the virtually unlimited target sequence range it affords, with the only constraint being the need for a 5' T, specified by the constant N-terminal domain, for each array.

In contrast, implementing exploratory efficacy measures in a small early-stage safety trial may be inexpensive and introduce minimal risk to the primary endpoint(s).

But it is incorrect to call these data 'real-world data' as this term has a specific regulatory meaning.","What are real-world data?. Real world is a term that is important to define as it is often misused. The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). These data sources include electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile technologies. Real-world evidence is the evidence derived from real-world data. In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute real-world data. However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial. They do not represent the overall population in a certain indication. Therefore, when working with clinical research, it is important to focus on the benefits of health-related data collected in natural settings - which may not be classified as 'real world' by a strict regulatory definition.",260,65,0.25

As verification studies typically happen at the bench without human subjects, they do not usually require ethics committee review. Validation almost always involves human subject testing; it is the process of ensuring that the output data from the technology are accurate against a gold standard (analytic validation) and an appropriate reflection of the clinical concept of interest (clinical validation). Answering the latter will often involve testing the technology with human participants, which may require an ethics committee review before testing (see chapter 5). Clinical validation has multiple dimensions. We will not go into all of them here, but one example is whether a change in your new measurement is regarded as meaningful by people with the disease. Do the results generated by the tool capture all aspects of the concept you are measuring? Do changes to measurement values predict certain clinical outcomes down the road? Does the measurement respond to an intervention that is well understood to have an effect on the property you are measuring in that population?

Digital biomarkers may initially be validated in the context of clinical research, and eventually transition to a validated digital diagnostic or a digital therapeutic.","Finally, many consider that the 6-minute walk test fails to demonstrate strong ecological validity, that is, it is a poor measure of how test performance predicts behaviors in real-world settings. Stellmann et al. offer an excellent exploration of the ecological validity of mobility outcomes, including the 6-minute walk test, in multiple sclerosis and consider the opportunities for digital tools to improve these measures. Regardless of the quality of a legacy standard, it is unlikely that a digital measurement will agree perfectly with the existing standard. In fact, for this reason, digital measures garner a lot of excitement: they may turn out to be more sensitive than traditional measures or be capable of measuring something researchers have never been able to measure before. Traditional measurements provide only a tiny snapshot of information about a patient's experience of their disease, and they are also fraught with confounders such as white coat syndrome, where a patient's feeling of anxiety in a medical environment results in an abnormally high reading when assessing blood pressure. In other instances, a digital assessment may measure an aspect of disease that has been inaccessible with traditional measures. For the DMD example, a more inclusive digital measurement could be of upper limb mobility, which can be applied to a much broader population of DMD patients. However, there would be little utility in trying to tether this new digital measure against the legacy standard of a 6-minute walk test. To summarize simply, if the test can be performed by a good engineer or physicist who flunked biology, then it is verification. If it requires medical knowledge, it is validation. When is something 'validated' enough?. The answer depends on the specific application. Tools need to be fit for purpose. The level of validation associated with a medical product development tool should be sufficient to support its context of use, a regulatory term that refers to a description of how the tool is used and where it is applied.

Companies that develop digital biomarkers validate these tools through clinical research as a first step toward what may eventually become a validated digital diagnostic or a digital therapeutic. Similarly, a number of big tech companies are also developing digital measures for clinical settings. In 2018, the FDA cleared a 'software as a medical device' (SaMD) for the Apple Watch, which can determine the presence of atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart condition. This clearance provides a regulatory pathway for companies to create more advanced diagnostics and interventions for the patient, at home, decentralized. There is crossover in use between research and routine care, such as the safety monitoring of trial participants during the course of a clinical study.

9783318068207,hh-3,DNA carries the genetic code in the form of sequences of codons; each codon codes for a specific amino acid or a stop signal.,"A codon is a sequence of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that matches a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis. DNA and RNA molecules are written in a language of four nucleotides; meanwhile, the language of proteins includes 20 amino acids. Codons provide the key that permits these two languages to be translated into each other. Each codon corresponds to a single amino acid (or stop signal), and the full set of codons is called the genetic code. A gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the creation of a gene product, either RNA or protein. Genes are built up of DNA. Some genes act as instructions to make proteins. However, many genes do not code for proteins. In humans, genes can differ in size ranging from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million bases. The Human Genome Project calculated that humans have between 20 000 and 25 000 genes. In most genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by non-coding regions (introns) (Figure 1.3).",219,28,0.1278538812785388

During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons linked to form a contiguous coding sequence. Non-coding DNA. Only about 1% of DNA is made up of protein-coding genes; the other 99% is non-coding. Although non-coding DNA does not provide instructions for making proteins, it is essential to the function of cells, particularly the control of gene activity. Non-coding DNA contains sequences that work as regulatory elements, determining when and where genes are turned on and off. Such elements provide sites for specialized proteins called transcription factors to bind and either activate or repress the process by which the information from genes is turned into proteins during transcription. These processes are very relevant in cancer genetics. Non-coding DNA contains many types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers and insulators (Figure 1.4).",203,47,0.2315270935960591

Nucleotide repeats are short DNA sequences that are repeated many times in a row. A trinucleotide repeat is composed of three-base-pair sequences, and a tetranucleotide repeat is composed up of four-base-pair sequences. A repeat expansion is a mutation that increases the number of times that the short DNA sequence is repeated. This type of mutation can cause the resulting protein to function inadequately. A point mutation or substitution is a genetic mutation in which a single nucleotide base is changed, inserted or deleted from a sequence of DNA or RNA. Point mutations have a variety of effects on the downstream protein product. These consequences can range from no effect (for example, synonymous mutations) to effects deleterious to protein production, composition and function.

Base substitutions/single-nucleotide variants are the simplest type of gene-level mutation. As one nucleotide is swapped for another during DNA replication, the overall number of nucleotides in the DNA is unchanged.

This tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that inhibits cell division or survival in response to several stresses. It is a critical failsafe mechanism of cellular anticancer defense. Tumor protein p53 regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair and metabolism changes. In cancer, its usual roles are not carried out, so cells survive and proliferate and DNA damage accumulates. TP53 mutations are the most frequent mutations in patients with cancer, occurring in approximately half of all cancers.

Dysregulation of the pathway results in increased cell division and survival.,"The MAPK signaling pathway begins with the activation of a RAS family protein by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; Figure 1.6). The activated RAS induces the membrane recruitment and activation of RAF kinases, which phosphorylate MEK, a separate protein kinase in the pathway. MEK phosphorylates ERK, which can, directly and indirectly, activate many transcription factors. The activation of these transcription factors by ERK leads to the expression of genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation and survival.",108,27,0.25

This method, which was the basis of the Human Genome Project, essentially allowed a net signal to be derived from a pool of molecules, to give a collective sequence.

These are described below and summarized in Figure 2.3; the pros and cons of each platform are summarized in Table 2.1. The Illumina platform is based on the technique of bridge amplification and uses synthesis with fluorescent detection. DNA molecules of around 500 bp, with appropriate adapters ligated to each end, are utilized as substrates for repeated amplification reactions on a solid substrate that contains complementary oligonucleotide sequences. The oligonucleotides are spaced on the solid substrate, usually a glass slide, so that repeated rounds of amplification create clonal clusters of around 1000 copies of the oligonucleotide fragment. All four of the nucleotides, which are fluorescently tagged, are added and compete for the next space. The complementary tagged nucleotide will bind, but a blocker prevents the binding of more than one nucleotide per round; the remaining non-bound nucleotides are washed away.",201,41,0.20398009950248755

Besides the classic biomarkers used by pathologists in every case of primary breast cancer, such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2, which guide prognostication and treatment selection, gene expression profile assays have recently been incorporated into the biomarker assessment of early breast cancer. Commercially available genomic assays that provide these profiles include Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Predictor Analysis of Microarrays 50 (PAM50), EndoPredict and Breast Cancer Index. Data from two large randomized clinical trials examining Oncotype DX and MammaPrint have yielded important evidence for use in discussions about potential benefit from chemotherapy in specific patient populations. When using the Oncotype DX assay, chemotherapy is not recommended for patients older than 50 years whose tumors have a recurrence score of less than 26. For those patients younger than 50 years whose tumors have a recurrence score of less than 16, there is little to no benefit from chemotherapy; however, clinicians may offer chemoendocrine therapy to those with a recurrence score in the range 16-25. In addition, oncologists may offer chemoendocrine therapy to any patient with recurrence score of 26-30.
