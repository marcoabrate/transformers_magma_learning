The 'leukemias' are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic disorders of blood cells . This chapter focuses on four main types of leukemia . acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) . Leukemia predominantly arises from acquired genetic abnormalities in the hematopoietic system . Gene mutations may occur at any stage of cell maturation, preventing normal maturation and/or leading to uncontrolled proliferation to the detriment of normal cell production . Exposure to radiation or carcinogens may cause gene mutations, but the most common reason for the development of leukemia is the accumulation of mutations associated with aging . Box 2.1 sets out some common terminology used when discussing the genetics of leukemia that, in conjunction with the karyotype shown in Figure 2.1, will help guide you through the following sections . Identifying mutations in leukemia . In addition, one type of mutation that is common in leukemia is a chromosome translocation, resulting in the formation of a novel fusion gene . Implications of identifying mutations . The identification of chromosomal abnormalities in leukemias has resulted in appropriate treatment stratification for patients with these conditions . Next-generation sequencing technology has revolutionized the discovery of mutations in leukemia, allowing the sequencing of patient genomic DNA at continually decreasing costs . The first whole genome from a patient to be sequenced was that of a patient with AML; subsequently, thousands of AML genomes have been sequenced . Characterization of the mutations found in large cohorts of patients with AML is providing insights into the molecular cooperativity between different mutations, and further studies may suggest how they interact . CLL and CML are both characterized by an increased number of maturing cells . However, in both ALL and AML the leukemia is characterized by highly proliferative immature cells that are blocked from differentiating . Many of these mutations are now targetable . In B-cell ALL, dynamic changes in the genome at different stages of treatment and relapse have been well characterized . Clonal subpopulations can be defined by the mutations that they share . Leukemic stem cells . Significant numbers of patients with leukemia relapse with the same clone of cells as that identified at diagnosis, suggesting that a subpopulation within the clone has intrinsic treatment resistance . Relapse then occurs when this leukemic stem cell population is able to reconstitute the leukemia . Subsequent work has focused on the identification of specific cell markers for leukemic stem cells and the mechanisms for self-renewal that facilitate their persistence . In B-cell ALL, the model for leukemic stem cells differs . There has been controversy over the precise immunophenotype of the leukemic stem cell . Furthermore, there is less evidence of the same hierarchical structure in B-cell ALL as in AML . Nevertheless, leukemia-initiating potential has been found in a wide range of clonal subpopulations . Classification of leukemias . Acute myeloid leukemia . The prognosis for a patient with AML depends on the subtype of AML . Although the FAB classification has given way to classifications more reliant on recurrent genetic abnormalities, morphological findings remain a cornerstone of AML classification . The WHO classification of AML recognizes six subgroups . AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (Table 2.2) . AML, not otherwise specified . 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk classification . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia . The FAB classification has now given way to the WHO classification . The 2016 WHO classification subdivides ALL into B- and T-cell ALL . B-cell ALL, which is more common than T-cell ALL in both adults and children, is further subtyped according to recurrent genetic abnormalities (Table 2.5) . As with AML, these different genetic abnormalities convey different prognostic characteristics to the leukemia . Problems distinguishing AML from ALL . Chronic myeloid leukemia is characterized by increased proliferation of the myeloid cell line without the loss of differentiation . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be subtyped on the basis of its staging classification, which is similar to lymphoma staging . Other forms of leukemia can also be of lymphoid or myeloid origin; they include . hairy cell leukemia . chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia . 
The primary goals of treatment for anorexia are to . restore patients to a healthy weight associated with . help patients learn, regain and maintain healthy eating patterns . address other psychological issues related to the primary diagnosis of anorexia . Table 6.1 shows the indications for hospitalization of adolescents with anorexia . Conversely, in other industrialized nations, it is not uncommon for patients to spend several weeks or even months in hospital in the initial treatment phase . Studies report that up to 40% of hospitalized patients with anorexia are readmitted at least once . Inpatient treatment studies of young adults suggest a continued role for hospitalization for severe cases . The Society of Adolescent Medicine's publication of medical treatment guidelines suggests a consistent pattern of acute hospitalization for patients with anorexia (see Table 6.1) . Non-pharmacological treatment . Because of the high cost of inpatient treatment and its disruptive effect on normal adolescent life, various outpatient approaches to individual, family and group therapy have been employed in the treatment of anorexia . family therapy or supportive therapy . Most clinicians base their interventions for adolescent patients on one of three models: individual psychodynamic therapy, family therapy and family-based treatment . The use of cognitive behavioral techniques is an integral part of most multimodal treatment programs for anorexia, whether on an outpatient or inpatient basis . However, rigorous efficacy treatment studies of intensive full-time or day treatment programs are few, especially in adolescents . Psychotherapy has been shown to be ineffective during the acute re-feeding stage of treatment, although a therapeutic alliance is helpful in increasing patient motivation . The emphasis on symptom reduction and simultaneous expectation of normalization of functioning characterizes psychodynamic treatment of anorexia . Cognitive-behavior therapy is less firmly established in the treatment of anorexia than of bulimia . There are no studies for the exact phasing of treatment, but the overall goal mirrors that of bulimia treatment (see Chapter 7) . A small controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of CBT as a post-hospitalization treatment for anorexia in adults found reduced relapse rates and improved outcomes . In randomized controlled trials in patients with anorexia, CBT was not found to be superior to other types of treatment such as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, cognitive-analytic therapy, family therapy for 1 year and low-contact routine treatment . However, adherence to treatment was better with CBT, suggesting that this technique may be more acceptable to patients than other psychological treatments . Family therapy . ii), the familial relationships of patients with early-onset anorexia should be examined . Family therapy is best started after a hospitalized patient has gained weight, but before discharge; it should be continued after the patient has left hospital . At present, the most evidence-based approach to anorexia treatment, particularly in adolescents, is family therapy . Published studies have considered family interventions during hospitalization and during outpatient treatments . In addition, taking the family dynamic into consideration in the treatment plan appears to have a specific effect on overall improvement in addition to weight gain . Psychopharmacological treatment . As for the psychotherapies, which are still considered the mainstay of anorexia treatment, the evidence base and, moreover, consensus on the most effective psychopharmacological treatments of anorexia are limited, in contrast to the treatment of bulimia . Although theoretically this type of medication should be useful in patients with anorexia, the results from controlled studies have been disappointing . Some patients report considerable and uncontrollable carbohydrate hunger . However, the research on treatment of anorexia with SSRIs has not been particularly promising . Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and clomipramine should not be used in patients with anorexia . Mood-stabilizing medications such as lithium have not been effective in patients with anorexia . Other pharmacological treatments . Other medications have been tried for the treatment of anorexia but have not demonstrated efficacy in published trials . Cyproheptadine, a serotonin and histamine antagonist that can produce weight gain in the treatment of children with asthma, has been tested for women with anorexia in two controlled studies . Optimizing treatment . Psychotherapy helps build a treatment alliance, with both the patient and the parents, to maximize compliance with prescribed weight gain . Treatment of anorexia . 
However, clinical symptoms can vary greatly between affected individuals . Most importantly, diagnosis is assisted by evidence of reduced PK enzyme activity together with the detection of compound heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the PKLR gene . There are difficulties with the performance and interpretation of assays for PK enzymatic activity . The differential diagnoses include several other forms of hemolytic anemia, which may be unfamiliar to clinicians (see Chapter 3) . Hemolytic markers can be difficult to interpret and can be confounded by other conditions (see Table 3.2) . It is likely that many cases of PK deficiency remain unrecognized . Consequently, the exact prevalence of PK deficiency is largely unknown . Clinical signs and symptoms . Anemia is relatively constant in young children through adulthood . Exacerbations of anemia are frequently observed in association with acute infections, stress and pregnancy, and commonly require transfusions . However, about 14% of these patients will remain transfusion dependent following splenectomy . Gallstones are detected in patients of all ages, with a median age of diagnosis of 15 years . Iron overload is frequently observed, even in patients who do not receive regular transfusions . The cause is unclear but may involve a degree of ineffective erythropoiesis, and co-inheritance of hereditary hemochromatosis mutations . Laboratory testing . A variable proportion of echinocytes (5-20%) is occasionally observed, more commonly after splenectomy . Reticulocyte count is usually elevated (by 4-11%), as in other hemolytic conditions . Hyperbilirubinemia during hemolysis is usually no more than 4 mg/dL, and higher values almost always imply coexisting Gilbert syndrome (Box 4.1) . Ferritin is frequently increased, even in patients who do not receive regular transfusions . Assessment of enzyme activity . PK enzymatic activity is usually determined in RBC lysates by spectrophotometric assay . Activity is calculated from the rate of pyruvate production, linked to the oxidation of NADH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) . The decrease in optical density that occurs as NADH is oxidized is measured by a spectrophotometer at 340 nm . The assay takes 2-3 hours to perform and is not expensive . However, there is no clear correlation between the severity of the clinical picture and PK activity as determined by the assay . False-positive results suggesting PK deficiency may be due to poor sample storage . For this reason a normal control sample stored under the same conditions should also be tested . PK enzyme activity may be considered stable at 4°C for up to 21 days after blood collection, although a maximum of 14 days of storage is recommended . It is recommended that testing of PK activity is delayed until at least 40-60 days after a transfusion . Decreased PK activity may be found in heterozygous carriers (although the levels of reduction are generally less) . DNA sequence analysis of the . The PKLR gene encoding erythrocyte PK is located on chromosome 1q21 . It consists of 12 exons and is approximately 9.5 kb in size . With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for diagnostic purposes, PKLR is typically included in gene panels designed for the diagnosis of hereditary hemolytic anemias . DNA analysis offers obvious advantages compared to biochemical testing . It requires smaller sample volumes . Samples are easier to handle and ship . There is no interference from transfused RBCs . It is suitable for prenatal diagnosis . However, not all the mutations detected by DNA analysis can be immediately classified as causative until their pathogenic nature is confirmed by other functional tests . Genetic testing will develop further with the use of whole-genome sequencing, although it will still be limited by the ability to interpret bioinformatic data . Genotype-phenotype relationship . More recently, the genotype-phenotype correlation has been investigated by the production and characterization of recombinant mutant proteins and their comparison with the wild-type PK enzyme . This approach allowed the definition of the effects of amino acid replacements on the stability and kinetic properties of PK . Notably, there was no evidence of an association between PK enzyme activity and the genotype . 
PK deficiency was first described in 1961 . To understand the impact of PK deficiency, it is necessary to review the overall metabolism in RBCs . Metabolic pathways in normal red blood cells . Instead, RBCs rely on breaking down glucose to pyruvate and lactate to produce energy . Two major metabolic pathways in RBCs use glucose as a substrate (Figure 1.1) . the glycolytic, or 'energy-producing', pathway . Glycolytic pathway . Under normal conditions, approximately 90% of glucose metabolism in RBCs occurs via the glycolytic pathway, with 5-10% metabolized via the HMP shunt . The key products of the glycolytic pathway are . adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for RBCs . This cofactor plays a vital role in protecting RBCs from oxidant injury by assisting in the production of reduced glutathione . Despite their metabolic limitations, normal RBCs have a lifespan of 100-120 days in the circulation . Impact of enzyme disorders on red blood cells . The consequences of enzyme disorders for RBCs are quite variable . Some will result in hemolytic disease manifesting solely as anemia, while others will manifest as a multisystem disorder, with hemolysis being just one feature of the disease . The most common enzyme disorder of RBCs in humans is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency . As a consequence, the production of NADPH by RBCs is impaired and their ability to withstand oxidant injury is diminished . Chronic hemolysis affects only a very small minority of people with this disorder . In contrast to G6PD deficiency, hemolytic anemias resulting from disorders of glycolytic enzymes are relatively rare, affecting only a few thousand individuals worldwide . While abnormalities in virtually every enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway have been described, PK deficiency is the most common associated with hemolysis, accounting for more than 90% of cases . Pyruvate kinase deficiency impairs normal glucose metabolism, resulting in inadequate ATP (energy) production by RBCs . In severely affected RBCs, the reduced levels of ATP lead to cell injury, a loss of membrane plasticity and the formation of rigid RBCs, which are destroyed in the spleen and liver . In some PK-deficient patients with high reticulocyte counts, ATP levels may be normal or even elevated . The availability of oxygen and glucose within the spleen is limited, restricting the ability of PK-deficient reticulocytes to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation . The most severely affected reticulocytes will be destroyed, either in the spleen or subsequently in the liver . Less severely affected reticulocytes will have a longer survival . Splenectomy can result in robust, sustained reticulocytosis because severely PK-deficient reticulocytes are no longer subjected to the adverse conditions within the spleen . PK deficiency also results in a build-up of 2,3-DPG, an intermediate product of the glycolytic pathway (see Figure 1.1) . Increases of up to three times normal have been recorded . Manifestations of glycolytic enzyme disorders . Individuals who are heterozygous for a mutation almost always show no hematologic abnormalities, although the level of enzyme activity within their RBCs is reduced . Hemolysis was initially believed to occur only in individuals who were homozygous for an enzyme deficiency . Instead, most individuals with hemolytic anemia due to a deficiency in a glycolytic enzyme are heterozygous for two different enzyme variants . The clinical manifestations of PK deficiency are discussed in Chapter 5 . More generally, the hemolysis resulting from an enzyme deficiency can manifest as chronic anemia of varying severity, reticulocytosis and some degree of indirect hyperbilirubinemia . Hemolysis may be accelerated as a result of non-specific infections . Mutations of the PKLR gene are associated with PK deficiency (see Chapter 2) . PK deficiency was originally thought to result from decreased production of a structurally normal enzyme . 
autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which targets the hepatocyte . primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which affects the microscopic bile ducts . The classic immunologic profiles associated with these conditions are shown in Table 5.1 . Autoimmune hepatitis . The target cell for the immunologic response is the hepatocyte, and the dominant effector cells are lymphocytes and plasma cells . Two types of AIH are defined by classic autoantibody profiles . type 1: anti-smooth-muscle antibodies with or without antinuclear factor . type 2: anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies . Fibrosis or cirrhosis may be established by the time of presentation or may develop during follow-up despite apparently adequate therapy . Clinical features . There is a strong gender association, with 70% of cases occurring in women . The age at presentation has a bimodal distribution, with peaks during the second decade and the fourth and fifth decades . A liver biopsy will show the characteristic features, with or without fibrosis or cirrhosis . These patients may present with liver failure or complications of portal hypertension . The standard treatment for AIH is immunosuppression with corticosteroids and azathioprine . Initial control is achieved with corticosteroids (exempli gratia prednisone, 30-60 mg/day) . The dose is gradually reduced over 2-3 months to a target dose of 5-10 mg/day . Azathioprine is added as a steroid-sparing strategy and can be effective in maintaining remission, even after complete withdrawal of corticosteroids . The serum aminotransferases and IgG levels are used to monitor response to therapy . These flares are treated in a similar way to newly diagnosed disease . Primary biliary cirrhosis . The asymptomatic phase is being increasingly recognized, however, with the detection of increased alkaline phosphatase levels on routine blood tests . The diagnosis is effectively established by the detection of positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), usually of the M2 subtype . The IgM fraction of the serum gammaglobulins is normally raised . Clinical features . The first symptoms are usually pruritus (itch) and lethargy (tiredness) . Antihistamines are not effective in this situation . The therapies used to treat the pruritus are listed in Table 5.2 . The cause of the lethargy is also unclear, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that it is 'central' and secondary to changes within the brain . At this stage, patients may also exhibit signs of portal hypertension, with ascites and esophageal or gastric varices . There is no curative medical therapy for PBC . There is, however, limited evidence that UDCA prolongs survival or delays the need for liver transplantation . A number of other immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies have failed to demonstrate sufficient benefit to gain widespread use . Liver transplantation is still the only effective treatment for advanced PBC . Primary sclerosing cholangitis . PSC can affect all elements of the biliary system . Cholangiography classically shows diffuse stricturing and beading involving both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts . In some cases, the extrahepatic bile ducts are spared, which reduces the confidence in making the diagnosis on radiological criteria . Clinical features . Natural history . This is less predictable than that of PBC . Fluctuations in disease may . settle spontaneously . respond to antibiotic therapy . respond to treatment with UDCA . improve after endoscopic dilation of a dominant stricture . A rapid deterioration may indicate the development of a complicating cholangiocarcinoma . UDCA, 10-15 mg/kg/day, is recommended . Immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies have not proved effective . The results of liver transplantation are excellent in the absence of cholangiocarcinoma . PSC recurs in 8-15% of cases and is occasionally a cause of significant graft dysfunction . Overlap syndromes . 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) can almost span a lifetime: average time from disease onset to death is 48 years . Women tend to survive longer than men, unless they have the primary progressive subtype, in which case they do less well than men . Disease onset at a younger age is also associated with longer survival . Comorbidities increase the risk of mortality from MS . Use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs; see Chapter 5) may reduce time to secondary progression, and there is soft evidence of a positive effect on all-cause mortality from the long-term (21-year) follow up of patients randomized to interferon beta (IFNbeta)-1b in the pivotal Phase III trial of that therapy . Death is usually caused by a complication rather than as a direct result of a MS exacerbation (Table 9.1) . Aspects of disease progression . The course of MS is highly variable and often unpredictable in the early relapsing phase of the disease . However, secondary progression ensues in up to 75% of patients with relapsing remitting disease and is marked by inexorable decline that is unaffected by current approved treatments . Some medications under review may decrease disease progression, potentially reducing long-term disability and mortality risk . In a proportion of these patients, severe symptomatology affecting all aspects of neurological functioning may develop . A cohesive multidisciplinary team (see Chapter 8) is important to effectively manage this phase of the disease . Neuropsychiatric complications, including depression and cognitive impairment, can limit or impede interactions with healthcare services . Common features of advanced MS include . Palliative care . Early intervention from the palliative care team can be highly beneficial to the patient's quality of life . As far as possible, control over the effects of the disease process should remain with the patient . The World Health Organization states that palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems - physical, psychosocial and spiritual . Palliative care is commonly perceived as a type of care only available at the end stages of a disease, usually cancer . Today, the focus is on integration of palliative care with ongoing treatment . Discussion of the results of disease progression and possible outcomes can be valuable . Aspects of MS that may benefit from the input of the palliative care team are shown in Table 9.2 . Palliative care in people with MS is not typical of palliative care in patients with other conditions in that it can be introduced in patients who are still receiving active treatment . It can be perceived as care of the dying patient, but this is a limiting perspective that prevents the benefits of palliative care reaching a wider group of patients . End-stage MS can be managed in a variety of settings: at home with specialist nursing care, or in a nursing home, hospital or hospice . People with MS who are no longer mobile are at risk of developing pressure sores . In patients with contractures, inspection of the areas under constant pressure is vital . Help from speech and language therapists and dietitians can minimize this risk . This decision is often included in an advance directive (see below) . Bladder problems arising from MS are often exacerbated by limited mobility and coordination, which makes self-catheterization difficult . In later stages, insertion of suprapubic catheters may be the treatment of choice . Before inserting a catheter, the patient should be formally assessed by a continence specialist . Advance directives . These are legal documents that inform the professionals caring for a person with MS what their wishes would be in a variety of situations . As individuals may reach a point where they are no longer deemed to have the capacity to make decisions about their own care, these decisions clearly need to be made in advance . The legal power of these documents varies from one jurisdiction to another, but advance directives are a vital part of the decision-making process (Table 9.3) . Lasting (UK), enduring (Australia) or durable (USA) power of attorney is an alternative to an advance directive, whereby a person with MS can appoint a person to make decisions regarding their care once they are no longer able to . This can include decisions regarding their finances and well-being, as well as specific healthcare decisions . 
Risk factors . Although there is some overlap between risk factor profiles for OA incidence and OA progression, these profiles are not identical . The factors that have been studied as indicators for radiographic progression of tibiofemoral knee OA are listed in Table 4.1 . Increasingly, studies employing MRI are using true cartilage assessments (rather than radiographic surrogates such as joint-space narrowing) and are finding similar predictors of progression or progressive cartilage loss . Generalized or systemic susceptibility factors include . genetic factors . Localized or biomechanical factors include . Genetic factors . Genome-wide association studies . The UK arcOGEN study of over 7400 cases of hip and knee OA was the first GWAS to report replicable, multiple, independent, genetic associations in OA . It demonstrated that, at a molecular genetic level, OA risk is not the same at different joint sites, id est a polymorphism can be associated with hip OA but not knee OA . Over the next few years there are likely to be more genome-wide methylation studies on cartilage and other joint tissues . In one study, adipokine levels were found to be higher in patients with severe knee OA than in those without radiographic knee OA . Although no association was found between adipokine levels and cartilage damage, a weak but positive association with synovial inflammation was demonstrated . The majority of longitudinal studies of obesity in OA relate to incident (new development of) OA, and the cross-sectional studies to OA presence versus absence . Although fewer studies have focused on progression of OA, the association with BMI appears less clear cut, and may be mediated by malalignment . Older studies have suggested a negative association of osteoporosis with OA, especially at the hip, although many of these studies have been cross-sectional . Studies have suggested a generalized increase in bone mass in women with OA of the hands, adding to theories on the role of subchondral bone in the pathogenesis of OA . However, increased BMD is not translated into a reduced fracture risk, perhaps due to OA-associated locomotor problems . The relationship between BMD and OA progression at the knee has not been fully elucidated . As mentioned above, the prevalence of OA increases in women after the menopause . Lower levels of vitamin D (an essential component of normal bone biology) have been associated with a greater risk of knee OA progression in some studies, but the association remains controversial . The effect of occupations on OA progression is unknown . The knee joint has probably been best studied in this regard, especially in athletes in whom repetitive high-weight loading is associated with increased rates of OA . Several studies suggest that recreational physical and athletic activity (not at the elite level) does not increase the risk of developing knee OA in a healthy joint . The role of subchondral bone may be important in the initiation of OA . Ligament abnormalities are commonly associated with OA in MRI studies, and some work in early OA suggests that ligament abnormalities are associated with development of the disease . What causes OA joint pain? . Importantly, the cause of joint pain in OA is not well understood . Possible peripheral sites of pain origin include the . Although MRI is superior to radiographs for visualizing osteophytes, MRI studies have not consistently confirmed the relationship between osteophytes and pain suggested by radiographic studies . Structure-pain studies . The vast majority of these radiographic studies have focused on the knee . Such studies are often difficult to interpret because of differences in how the pain was measured (exempli gratia global pain versus night pain versus weight-bearing pain) and the limitations of conventional radiographs . In addition, many radiographic studies did not include the patellofemoral joint . MRI features associated with OA knee pain . MRI studies have shown the following abnormalities to be related to knee pain, though it should be noted that even these pathologies have only weak pain associations . An association of effusion with pain in OA of the knee has also been suggested in ultrasonography studies, whereas arthroscopy studies (which differ in their ability to visualize and quantify synovitis) have not shown this association . The subchondral bone has been thought to be a source of pain in OA for many years . 
Management tools . Managing obesity in clinical practice is often complex and time consuming . A plethora of online tools, publications and weight-loss programs are available for the management of obesity at both an individual level in clinical practice and on a larger scale within the community, and evidence of their effectiveness is beginning to emerge . org) is a community multidisciplinary program for overweight and obese children and their families, currently in use in the USA . In a randomized controlled trial, 116 obese children were randomly assigned to MEND intervention or waiting list control (6-month delayed intervention) . Mean attendance for the program was 86% . OBEMAN, which stands for Obesity Management, is a commercial step-by-step computer program, designed by one of the authors (G . Wittert), to help health professionals with the management of obese and overweight patients . The program provides . tools tailored to health professionals (evidence-based information, links to peer-reviewed articles, practical management tips) and patients (fact sheets, food and activity diaries, healthy eating guides) . practical and effective lifestyle programs, including nutrition, activity, behavior management and counseling . Following the initial consultation, the patient's history, management plan and progress to date can be reviewed at each visit, and weight and waist circumference updated . Additional support for a particular management approach is then provided or a new action can be chosen . At the end of the consultation the program provides a prompt to schedule the next appointment with the patient to review the outcome and implement the next step . Rather than using a linear approach, the OBEMAN program allows management to start at any point (diet, physical activity, education, etc . depending on the requirements of the patient . org) is an evidence-based weight management program for use in primary care . The model is based on weight management advisers: dietitians specializing in obesity management who train and support primary practice staff to incorporate the program into existing healthcare services . Patients can choose between a goal-setting approach, a structured eating plan or a group program, all based on 500-600 kcal daily energy deficit . Patients also receive advice on increasing physical activity, and behavioral strategies are a core component of the model . The program is flexible and can be delivered individually or to families or groups, depending on need and resources . Second-line interventions may include the use of anti-obesity medications and referral to a dietitian, psychologist or secondary care services . Weight maintenance is encouraged either following weight loss or as the first option with particular groups of patients . As of November 2010, 6715 patients with a mean BMI of 37.3 kg/m were enrolled on the program . Attendance for patients at 3, 6 and 12 months was 55%, 37% and 28%, respectively . Of those who attended at 12 months, 35.2% had maintained a weight loss of more than 5% . Obesity-related cardiovascular disease risk factors improved in the whole cohort . Counterweight Plus was developed as a non-surgical weight management program for individuals with greater weight loss needs, commencing with a total diet replacement of 810 kcal followed by stepped food reintroduction and weight loss maintenance . In total, 62% of patients with an initial BMI of > 40kg/m completed the liquid diet phase and achieved a mean weight loss of 17.4 kg . At 12 months, the mean loss of the 75% of individuals with a follow-up weight was 12.4 kg . Obesity care pathways must be robust, evidence based and focused on local needs . A good example is provided by the UK's National Obesity Forum (NOF), based on that of the Rotherham Institute for Obesity - a fully integrated traditional four-tier model for obesity management: www . Prevention initiatives . In the UK, there have been some important initiatives, such as . EPODE is an obesity prevention program that aims to integrate healthier lifestyles into daily life . By creating changes in group dynamics, changes in social norms occur, leading to healthier lifestyles . Since 2004, EPODE has been implemented in more than 500 communities in six countries . epode-european-network . com), the EPODE International Network (www . epode-international-network . Health professionals have an ethical and moral obligation, and the opportunity, to promote public health as well as taking care of individual patients . role modeling healthy behaviors . 
They are often used as replacement therapy or to augment the body's own response and are characterized by simple modes of action through one receptor-mediated pathway . The second group of three are direct anti-cancer therapies: rituximab, trastuzumab and bevacizumab . These are monoclonal antibodies that bind to soluble or cell-surface proteins and block pathways or cells, often with multiple modes of action and toxicity . Epoetin alfa . Epoetin alfa is a 165-amino acid erythropoiesis-stimulating glycoprotein produced in mammalian cell culture using recombinant DNA technology . Market research data show biosimilar competition in Europe was associated with real price reductions of 51%, 53% and 66% in Norway, Slovakia and Portugal, respectively . Recombinant human red cell growth factors were first approved in Europe in 2007 and the USA in 2018 . However, three issues combined to undermine confidence in the potential safety of biosimilar epoetin . Formulation changes, medicines handling and differences in injection device were associated with serious drug safety events . TABLE 9.2 Diagnostic criteria for epoetin-antibody-mediated PRCA . Unexplained loss of drug effect and . Anemia (Hb decreases by about 0.1 g/dL/day) . Low reticulocyte count (< 10 000/μL) . Platelets and white blood cells are normal . Bone marrow (strongly recommended) shows . Normal cellularity . Erythroblasts very rare (< 5%) . Positive epoetin-antibody test and evidence of their neutralizing capacity . Hb, hemoglobin; PRCA, pure red cell aplasia . From Casadevall et al . Epoetin was suggested to promote cancer growth . The REMS required that patients be counseled of a risk of shortened overall survival and/or increased risk of tumor progression with ESAs before prescribing . The question of a potential unknown 'off-target' effect of epoetins on cancer growth was raised . Changes in the manufacturing process of a reference ESA were shown to cause differences that could not be resolved through analytics alone . The immunogenicity of biosimilar epoetin was assessed for comparability in analytics and clinical confirmatory studies . Furthermore, in over 10 years of European experience with biosimilars there has been no approval for which comparable immunogenicity in regulatory studies has not predicted real-world outcomes . For cancer chemotherapy . Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim . It has one known target, the G-CSF receptor . In bone marrow, precursor G-CSF promotes maturation into mature neutrophils and stimulates their release into the circulation . It also acts on mature neutrophils to increase their phagocytic activity against infections . The first recombinant G-CSF filgrastim was approved in 1991, and its value has been evolving ever since . Initial health technology assessments suggested low value because of high drug costs and no evidence for significant gain in overall survival . The increase in mature neutrophils in the blood of healthy human volunteers is a sensitive pharmacodynamic marker for efficacy and a predictor of its effect on neutropenia . Finally, brand switching was unlikely to be a clinical issue, as typical chemotherapy treatment courses last only 3-4 months . This contrasts strongly with ESAs in renal disease or biological anti-inflammatory drugs in rheumatoid disease, where treatment duration is measured in years . The Phase III Pioneer trial (EP06-302 in the ODAC documents) had a novel four-arm design (Table 9.4) . Unlike a typical two-arm confirmatory clinical study, patients were randomized into four arms . Blood counts and toxicity could be compared between 192 patients split evenly into two groups on cycle 1 . Over the full six cycles of the trial, there is a second potential comparison of efficacy and toxicity for both brands . This increases the total events studied, giving additional efficacy and safety data . The relevant indications for pegfilgrastim are summarized in Table 9.5 . In April 2017, the US FDA raised questions about the PEG accumulation reported in animal models . In the same period, the USA approved Fulphila and Udenyca . 
At present there is no single laboratory marker that can provide equivalent information at an earlier time point . Factors that are associated with more severe damage are listed in Table 7.1 . Smoking is also associated with more erosive disease, potentially via its association with anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) positivity . At presentation, a longer duration of symptoms, functional limitation (see below), or a raised acute-phase response are all associated with a worse prognosis . Lastly, the presence of X-ray erosions at presentation is, not surprisingly, a poor-prognostic sign . For example, a swollen-joint count and a measure of the acute-phase response provide useful objective measures . Additionally, satisfaction with medical management may depend more upon the patient's functional capabilities . Importantly, the same physical impairment can result in varying degrees of disability . Thus, a deformity affecting the non-dominant hand will be of more consequence to a musician than to a writer . Furthermore, the same deformity in an elderly person may prevent them from dressing themselves and therefore could be socially isolating . Psychological factors, including coping strategies and illness perception, are also important determinants of disability, as are social perspectives . Thus, the elderly person living alone will be more disabled than if they have a partner to help them dress . Anxiety and depression also have major impacts on the degree of disability experienced . Assessing function . Functional impairment may be evident at presentation . A number of self-completion questionnaires that focus on function and participation have been designed and validated . They are useful tools for assessing current disease status but also carry prognostic significance (see above) . Quality of life (QoL) encompasses a number of dimensions, including physical, social, psychological and economic aspects . Functional capabilities are an important determinant of QoL, and some questionnaires address both . Composite scores . The ACR response criteria were designed for assessing outcomes in the clinical trials setting . A 20% improvement in swollen and tender joint counts, and in three of the remaining five parameters, represents an ACR20 response . This is the minimum required for efficacy in most trials . ACR50 and ACR70 responses are calculated in a similar fashion . While useful for monitoring clinical trials, these scores have not been validated in the routine clinical setting . Furthermore, they relate to a particular baseline, and a given improvement may be more difficult to achieve from a less active baseline . Thus, a 20% improvement from a baseline of five swollen joints may be more difficult to achieve than from a baseline of 20 swollen joints . Increasingly, the DAS is being used in the routine clinic setting . The DAS28 is a modification based on 28 swollen and tender joints (see Figure 7.3) . The Sharp score considers erosions and joint-space narrowing independently, and can also be used to discriminate between new joints affected versus progression in previously affected joints . The rate of progression and severity of joint damage are both relevant to functional impairment . X-ray damage usually occurs slowly and changes are rarely visible on images taken a few months apart . Thus, although a gold standard for structural outcome, radiology is of limited use in early disease or for monitoring the effects of therapy in the short term . Furthermore, Larsen and Sharp scores are seldom recorded in routine clinical practice, as opposed to the research setting . Biochemical markers of damage . Urinary deoxypyridinolone cross-links may also reflect bone damage . Markers of collagen synthesis have also been identified but no consistently useful assays are yet available for measuring proteoglycan synthesis or breakdown . Other potential markers of tissue damage include circulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) levels, particularly MMP3 levels . These criteria are very exacting, however, and are unlikely to be fulfilled by patients with joint damage . At the time of press replacement criteria were being developed jointly by ACR and EULAR . The SDAI and CDAI also have very stringent remission criteria . A DAS28 <= 3.2 defines low disease activity . Alternative criteria are being defined and debated, including the use of synovial imaging . Furthermore, mild disease can be readily controlled with relatively non-toxic drugs or may even spontaneously remit . 
Avoidance of triggers where possible can also be important (see allergen avoidance in Chapter 6) . Potential systemic adverse effects include thinning of the skin, cataract formation, adrenal suppression and decreased bone metabolism and growth . In general, the risk of significant systemic effects is low with therapeutic doses . Systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, can be given either orally or parenterally . Leukotriene modifiers . They are generated from arachidonic acid by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway that operates in mast cells and eosinophils . A clinical response is usually seen within 3 weeks of therapy, though not all patients benefit . Sodium cromoglicate and nedocromil sodium . They work by stabilizing mast cells and sensory nerves by stimulating the newly identified GP receptor 35 . Adverse effects are few, though coughing may result from inhalation of the powder formulation . As these agents have few side effects, they have found particular use in childhood asthma . Sustained-release theophylline . Theophylline is a bronchodilator, and there is some evidence that it may also have anti-inflammatory effects . Furthermore, the drug has a relatively narrow therapeutic index; serum concentrations producing adverse effects are close to those required for therapeutic efficacy . Monitoring is advisable when treatment is started and at regular intervals thereafter . In addition, serum drug concentrations should be monitored if . adverse events occur with the usual dose . the expected therapeutic benefit is not achieved . Adverse events associated with LABAs include cardiovascular stimulation, anxiety, heartburn and tremor . The dose is titrated according to body weight and the serum level of total IgE . Reliever medications . The most effective forms are those that are delivered by inhalation directly to the airways . Short-acting beta -agonists . Several points are worth making in relation to the use of these quick relievers . The use of one canister of a metered-dose inhaler per month should certainly sound alarm bells . Systemic corticosteroids . Anticholinergic agents . They also inhibit reflex bronchoconstriction provoked by inhaled irritants . Adverse effects include dry mouth and a bad taste . Short-acting theophylline . Combination therapy . Delivery of inhaled medication . A variety of delivery devices are available (Table 4.4) . Delivery is efficient when the device is used correctly (see Figure 4.1) . Many patients, however, are unable to coordinate inspiration with inhaler actuation . The medication is discharged into the spacer and held in suspension for several seconds . A small-volume spacer can be adapted with a face mask for young children . This increases systemic bioavailability from lung absorption and consequently increases the risk of side effects unless the dose is adjusted accordingly . Drug deposition appears to be greater than with pMDIs . No propellant is needed because the drug is released by inspiratory airflow . Inhalation of dry particles can cause coughing . Nebulizers generate a wet aerosol by blowing compressed air through a drug solution or suspension, or by ultrasonic vibration . The patient inhales the aerosol through a face mask or mouthpiece . Nebulizers have largely been replaced in emergency settings and for young children by pMDIs and spacers, which have demonstrated equivalent drug delivery . Nebulized therapy is still used for those with very severe lung disease or extreme attacks . A standard dose of nebulized beta -agonist is equivalent to eight to 12 puffs from a pMDI and spacer . There are two broad aims of asthma control . Recommended management strategies suggest five treatment steps . Step 2 is usually indicated for initial treatment in those who have moderate symptoms . Evidence supports this approach for reducing asthma exacerbations . It is also appropriate to seek specialist referral at this stage . Infants and young children . The symptom-driven stepwise approach to asthma care described above is similar in children . The dose ranges of inhaled corticosteroids should be considerably lower for children than for adults . Between these ages the choice of device depends on the child and their experience with the medication . Written treatment plan . 
The most common psychotic symptoms in PDP are hallucinations, illusions, delusions and delusional misidentification (see page 7) . Although the psychotic symptoms are the same as those that occur in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), they usually occur in patients taking medications for their PD motor symptoms (see pages 24 -), and less frequently in untreated patients . Hallucinations are usually visual, occurring in about 90% of people with PDP . Auditory hallucinations are about half as common . Tactile hallucinations are considerably less common, while olfactory and gustatory hallucinations are much less common . They are most commonly people, often children, sometimes Lilliputian in size, usually strangers but sometimes family members or friends . In general, they ignore the patient . The patient may notice someone or a few people sitting on the sofa, watching TV with him . The images ignore the patient when he talks to them but disappear if he approaches them . Patients may recognize these phenomena as hallucinations and not be bothered by them, especially if they occur only occasionally and for short durations . Patients usually have insight into the fantastic nature of the hallucinations, recognizing them as medication side effects, but may be unsure because the hallucinations seem so real . A patient driving his car was bothered by people in the back seat . Unlike schizophrenic hallucinations, PDP hallucinations generally have limited emotional content . Occasionally, patients may even look forward to the hallucinations; for example, the 'nice baby' who makes no noise, or the deceased spouse who sleeps beside the patient . Some patients may call the police when the hallucinated figures refuse to leave, or seem threatening simply by their presence, not necessarily because they look like they will attack the patient . They are not people making comments about the patient . These are generally not very bothersome, because patients are aware they are illusions and do not act on them . Illusions are rarely disturbing to the patient, other than making them worry about their perception of reality . Delusions are usually serious problems as they tend to be paranoid in nature and cause difficulties both for the patient and the caregivers . Because delusions are generally paranoid, they are often not discussed with family members or the doctor, as the patient and the family are embarrassed by the accusations . The family may be trying to institutionalize the patient . Vivid dreams are the most common problem mistaken for PDP . The dreams may seem so real that patients wake up thinking their dream really occurred . Dream phenomena . Patients with PD may exhibit dream enactment behavior . People with PD also sometimes have hypnopompic hallucinations, or REM intrusions, in which dreams occur in transition from sleep to wakefulness or from wakefulness to sleep . While these are, in fact, hallucinations, they are more appropriately considered dream phenomena . Since visual hallucinations are the most common psychotic symptom, the differential diagnosis may include Charles Bonnet syndrome, a disorder in which patients with severely impaired vision have visual hallucinations . It does not occur in elderly people with normal or near normal vision . The images are similar to those seen in PDP, being generally quite benign . Sometimes the same image or theme is seen repeatedly, as is typical in PDP, or the patient sees a spectrum of images . There are no delusions associated with this disorder . These 'release' hallucinations occur as a result of reduced stimuli, analogous to the hallucinations that occur when people are placed in extremely low sensory environments without light, sound and with minimal tactile stimuli . Auditory 'release' hallucinations associated with hearing loss are less common but do occur . Psychotic symptoms associated with primary psychiatric disorders . Loose associations are not generally seen in PDP . Patients with PDP who have loose associations, as are typical in schizophrenia, are almost always demented or delirious . Patients with PDP commonly experience other psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, irritability, agitation and aggression . Impulse control disorders are particularly prevalent in patients receiving dopamine agonists . Scales for assessing the severity of PDP . Several scales are used in clinical trials to assess the severity of PDP, but there is no single gold standard scale . In contrast to assessing severity, 'no scale adequately screens for psychosis' . PDP primarily consists of visual hallucinations, whereas those in schizophrenia are primarily auditory . However, they are central in psychiatric psychosis scales . Different studies have used different modifications of these scales, and other scales exist . 
Hodgkin lymphoma generally affects young people and can be cured in most cases . Microdissection techniques allowed the HRS cells to be isolated . Subsequent molecular techniques demonstrated the cells to be derived from a malignant B cell . Hodgkin lymphoma can really therefore be regarded as a B-cell lymphoma . The diagnosis rests on the finding of HRS cells in an appropriate cellular background of inflammatory and other reactive cells . A study in Scandinavia showed that glandular fever caused by EBV does increase the risk of subsequently developing EBV-positive cHL; the delay from glandular fever to the peak in incidence was 4 years . Immunosuppression due to infection with HIV or post-transplant immunosuppression also increases the risk of developing cHL, though this is by no means as great as the increase in risk of developing a high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) . In addition, nLPHL has a propensity to transform into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Clinical presentation . Classic Hodgkin lymphoma . Around 1800 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are diagnosed every year in the UK, with young people aged 15-35 years usually affected . In the USA, the incidence is 2.7/100000, with an estimated 9190 new cases in 2014 . In Australia in 2010, 572 new cases were diagnosed . A particularly characteristic presentation is with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes resulting in cough and breathlessness, particularly on lying flat . Superior vena caval obstruction is unusual . Pruritus is also a common symptom . Interestingly, alcohol-induced pain at sites of disease is a striking and characteristic feature of classic Hodgkin lymphoma, though somewhat rare . The presence of B symptoms (weight loss, night sweats or fevers) and bulky disease (>10 cm in diameter) are generally accepted to be associated with a poorer prognosis (Table 9.2) . Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the disease should be staged with positron emission tomography (PET)-CT . Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is much less common than its classic counterpart and behaves very differently . Presentation is nearly always with a single enlarged lymph node and disease is usually at a very early stage . Treatment has greatly improved over the last few decades . Early-stage disease can be considered as stages IA and IIA (with no bulk) . Classic Hodgkin lymphoma . Until relatively recently, early-stage disease was treated with extended-field radiotherapy alone . In particular, it was noted that second cancers could develop within the radiotherapy field . This was especially marked in women who had irradiation involving the breasts and in smokers who had irradiation involving the lungs . Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma . Although ABVD, which is the standard regimen for cHL, remains widely used for nLPHL, some centers are exploring regimens usually used to treat low-grade NHL . Late-stage disease can be considered as stages IIB-IV . Improvements in treatment have led to increased survival (Figure 9.3) . One major disadvantage of ABVD is the lung toxicity associated with bleomycin, which, if not noticed early, may lead to serious morbidity and sometimes death . If recognized early, however, treatment with corticosteroids is often successful . Vincristine also commonly produces a peripheral neuropathy, though this is seldom debilitating if managed correctly . Preliminary studies have suggested that a PET scan performed after two or three cycles of chemotherapy is very predictive of subsequent outcome . The potential benefit of this approach is unknown at present and it should only be used in the context of clinical trials . The management of residual mediastinal masses, which are common in Hodgkin lymphoma, is discussed on page 49 . Salvage chemotherapy is often offered to patients who relapse . It consists of different chemotherapy agents from those used as first-line therapy . The cure rate for these patients is about 50% . The cure rate for early-stage disease is generally excellent and approaches 95% . In late-stage disease the cure rate is 75-80% . although in those with a particularly poor prognosis it is 60-65% . As outlined previously, these include secondary cancers and heart disease . 
The commitment of differentiated cells is irreversible: for example, monocytes cannot form erythrocytes . Self-renewal . The ability to self-renew is maintained through a number of tightly regulated mechanisms that are gradually being elucidated . The incidence of uncontrolled proliferation (as occurs in cancer) is rare compared with the number of times the hematopoietic system has to respond by controlled proliferation to injury or infection . For example, vast numbers of neutrophils are drawn to sites of infection, but they have a limited lifespan and have to be replaced by upstream progenitors . This requires the HSCs to exit dormancy and generate intermediate progenitors (see Figure 1.1), which are able to divide rapidly and replenish these peripheral cells . Identification of upstream progenitor cells . The precursors of fully differentiated neutrophils and erythrocytes bear intermediate properties between the final cells and the HSCs . They have an increasingly restricted developmental potential as they complete their development . Traditionally, these precursor cells have been identified by labeling cell surface markers with antibodies conjugated to fluorescent proteins, which can then be identified by flow cytometry . For example, when common lymphoid progenitors are transplanted into irradiated mice, they give rise only to lymphocytes (Figure 1.2a) . Similarly, upstream intermediate progenitors of myeloid and erythroid cells have been identified . However, the exact lineages and potential of different intermediaries have been revised over the years . Normal blood cells can be sorted into individual cells using flow cytometry and RNA extracted . From this, the expression levels of different genes can be identified using next-generation sequencing . From this information, in combination with traditional transplantation studies, the ultimate fate of these cells can be determined . Above, we have described the differentiation of HSCs through various oligopotent, and eventually unipotent, terminal effector cells . A considerable body of work has emerged to explain how this is controlled so that sufficient, but not excessive, numbers of fully differentiated cells are generated in response to infection and inflammation . The role of cytokine signaling . Cytokines provide a signal to cells to proliferate and differentiate . Permissive versus instructive signaling . Permissive signaling . Mice in which the receptor for M-CSF has been removed produce only low numbers of monocytes . However, when myeloid cells are rescued by the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2, the monocyte numbers increase . This suggests that the role of cytokines is to allow the survival of HSCs, which enables them to fully differentiate . Instructive signaling . This study suggests that cytokine signaling can regulate cell-fate decisions . Overlapping role of cytokines . Different cytokines can activate the same receptors, and different receptors can have overlapping downstream effects . The role of specific transcription factors . Transcription factors are vital in the regulation of hematopoiesis . Evidence for this is seen through the disruption of hematopoiesis in both mouse models and in familial patterns of disease . Hematopoietic cells are exquisitely sensitive to subtle variations in expression levels of transcription factors . One important master regulator of hematopoiesis is the gene RUNX1 (AML1) . This gene is essential for the emergence of HSCs in the developing embryo . A complete absence of RUNX1 results in the death of the developing embryo . A dysfunctional copy of RUNX1 is inherited in familial platelet disease . Affected family members, who inherit this condition in an autosomal dominant manner, are thrombocytopenic with a predisposition to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is another important transcription factor in hematopoiesis . Mice with a knockout of the CEBPA gene lack mature neutrophils, suggesting that this gene is vital for their development . Recent studies have shown that germline mutations in CEBPA are associated with an increased risk of developing AML with a documented penetrance rate of 100% . Finally, there is an appreciation that transcription factors regulate each other's activities and form a network that defines the identity and function of each cell . 
Understanding the processes . Verification and validation are terms that are probably familiar to you if you come from an engineering or product development background . They apply to digital medicine, too . A sensor that is accurate, precise, consistent and uniform will 'give the right answer every time' . By undertaking verification assessments, the investigator can also be assured that the relevant firmware/software that generates processed data is also accurate, precise, consistent and uniform . Verification answers the question 'did I make the tool right?' Verification is an engineering assessment, and it is entirely separate from data collection from humans . Validation answers the question 'did I build the right tool?' The concept of validation can be broken down as follows . Analytic validation . Separating the sensor and the measure is the most important concept to remember when considering VandV . All sensors can be boiled down to the physical construct that is measured, such as acceleration, temperature or pressure . The process of verification evaluates the capture and transference of a sensor-generated signal into collected data . As verification studies typically happen at the bench without human subjects, they do not usually require ethics committee review . Answering the latter will often involve testing the technology with human participants, which may require an ethics committee review before testing (see chapter 5) . Clinical validation has multiple dimensions . We will not go into all of them here, but one example is whether a change in your new measurement is regarded as meaningful by people with the disease . The regulatory framework to deal with such systems is under active development at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Often, researchers will ask how a novel digital measure compares with a gold-standard assessment . We believe 'gold standard' is often a misnomer because many gold standards are not necessarily high-quality measures . For example, the legacy assessment in Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the 6-minute walk test . This is a poor endpoint for a number of reasons . First, it does not apply to the roughly 60% of that patient population who are confined to a wheelchair and cannot participate in a walk test . These biases may lead to noise that obscures the endpoint . Stellmann et al . Regardless of the quality of a legacy standard, it is unlikely that a digital measurement will agree perfectly with the existing standard . In other instances, a digital assessment may measure an aspect of disease that has been inaccessible with traditional measures . For the DMD example, a more inclusive digital measurement could be of upper limb mobility, which can be applied to a much broader population of DMD patients . However, there would be little utility in trying to tether this new digital measure against the legacy standard of a 6-minute walk test . To summarize simply, if the test can be performed by a good engineer or physicist who flunked biology, then it is verification . If it requires medical knowledge, it is validation . When is something 'validated' enough? . The answer depends on the specific application . Tools need to be fit for purpose . The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), a public private partnership co-founded by Duke University and the FDA, has developed comprehensive recommendations and resources on developing digital measurement tools for use as clinical trial endpoints . This may be a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the body of evidence that is required to support the use of a digital medicine tool in a clinical trial . Increasing overlap between clinical research and care . Historically, measures that support research (endpoints) and care (outcomes) were siloed . A number of companies are working toward a universal vision of human digital measurement across the continuum of research and clinical care . Similarly, a number of big tech companies are also developing digital measures for clinical settings . In 2018, the FDA cleared a 'software as a medical device' (SaMD) for the Apple Watch, which can determine the presence of atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart condition . This clearance provides a regulatory pathway for companies to create more advanced diagnostics and interventions for the patient, at home, decentralized . There is crossover in use between research and routine care, such as the safety monitoring of trial participants during the course of a clinical study . However, even in such crossover cases, the clinical trial environment is by its nature more structured and controlled than the variety of settings and scenarios where clinical medicine is practiced . 
Although hemophilia A and B are the most common severe coagulation disorders, congenital and acquired deficiencies of all the other clotting factors occur and can lead to a range of bleeding states that may cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties . These uncommon disorders include deficiencies of factor (F)II, FV, FVII, FX, FXI and FXIII and multiple factor deficiencies of the vitamin-K-dependent factors . Most of these disorders have autosomal-recessive traits; heterozygote individuals are asymptomatic, with clotting factor levels of about 50% . In homozygous, or compound heterozygote, individuals the level of the deficient clotting factor is very low . The frequency of severe bleeding in these disorders is shown in Figure 8.1 . As well as congenital disorders, acquired clotting factor deficiencies can result from their increased consumption (in association with massive hemorrhage or major surgery) or the presence of an autoantibody against a single clotting factor . Fibrinogen deficiency . Deficiency is associated with both bleeding and venous thrombotic manifestations . Factor II deficiency . Congenital deficiencies of FII (prothrombin) are due to homozygous or double heterozygous genetic mutations and are, therefore, recessively inherited . Bleeding manifestations are similar to those with deficiencies of FVII and FX . Factor V deficiency . Congenital FV deficiency is a rare recessively inherited disorder . Combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency . Combined deficiency of FV and FVIII is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder . Factor VII deficiency . Congenital FVII deficiency is an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder . Individuals with a moderate FVII deficiency (2-10% factor levels) often bleed from mucous membranes and have epistaxis, bleeding gums and menorrhagia, as well as perioperative hemorrhage . In patients with severe FVII deficiency (< 2% levels) bleeding into the CNS very early in life leads to a high morbidity and mortality . Rarely, a deficiency is observed in patients taking a penicillin or cephalosporin, and it has also been reported in patients with myeloma and sepsis . Factor X deficiency . The bleeding propensity is related to the FX plasma level . Factor XI deficiency . Individuals who are heterozygous for a mutation have a partial deficiency of FXI, whereas those who have a severe deficiency are either homozygous or compound heterozygotes . In type 2 deficiency, there is a stop codon in exon 5; in the homozygous state this results in a FXI level below 1 IU/dL . In type 3 deficiency Phe283 is replaced with Leu (coding in exon 9); in the homozygous condition this results in an FXI level of approximately 10 IU/dL . The deficiency is classified as severe if the FXI level is less than 20 IU/dL and partial at 20-70 IU/dL; the lower limit of the normal range is 60-70 IU/dL . Before surgery the postoperative bleeding risk should be assessed based on the patient's hemorrhagic history after previous surgery, FXI level and severity of the impending operation . For those with a partial deficiency it may be appropriate to undertake surgery with only careful attention to hemostasis and to use tranexamic acid for dental extractions . The FXI level may need to be raised in those with a severe deficiency who are undergoing major surgery . Combined deficiencies of factors II, VII, IX and X . Rarely, a congenital combined deficiency of FII, FVII, FIX and FX, as well as proteins C and S, is encountered . It is caused by deficiency of vitamin-K-dependent carboxylase as a result of homozygous genetic mutations . This condition must be distinguished from acquired deficiencies caused by liver disease or warfarin . Factor XIII deficiency . Congenital deficiency of FXIII is a rare autosomal recessive disorder . The severity of the bleeding state is related to the FXIII plasma levels . Acquired deficiency develops in patients in intensive care units following major surgery, and occasionally is of autoimmune origin . FXIII deficiency is not detected by a standard coagulation screen (aPTT, PT and fibrinogen) and can only be assessed by specific assays . 
The cigarette . There are many different varieties of cigarette tobacco, each with its own flavor and characteristics, and tobacco can be prepared in different ways that affect its taste, smell and pharmacological properties . Additives are included in cigarettes by the manufacturers to engineer an attractive and efficient nicotine delivery system . Table 1.1 lists some of the many thousands of chemicals in tobacco smoke . One thing that all cigarettes have in common is that they deliver nicotine to the lungs . In the UK and the USA, smokers absorb an average 1-2 mg of nicotine from each cigarette . This is only about one-sixth to one-third of what they could obtain if they puffed more frequently and inhaled the smoke more deeply . Control of the nicotine dose . This 'fingertip control' of the nicotine dose allows smokers to meet their current need while avoiding the acute adverse effects of too much nicotine . Many smokers, particularly older smokers and women, choose so-called 'light' or 'low-tar' brands, believing that these are safer . According to the reported analyses of their deliveries, these brands deliver as little as one-tenth of the tar and carbon monoxide of other brands . In fact, such reports are misleading: the data are based on artificial measurements by smoking machines and do not mirror the actual delivery to a smoker . Each smoker appears to have a preferred level of nicotine intake and will adjust the way he or she smokes to achieve that level . Recognizing this, the terms 'light' and 'low tar' have been banned from cigarette packaging and marketing in the USA and EU . Smokers who reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke typically compensate for the change by increasing the intensity of smoking such that smoke exposure remains unchanged . An exception is when they use another nicotine product at the same time, such as a nicotine patch or gum (see Chapter 7) . Nicotine and its elimination from the body . Nicotine is an alkaloid obtained from tobacco plants and has wide-ranging effects on the central nervous system (CNS) (see pages 37-8) . Its structure (Figure 1.2) resembles that of the major neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and it activates cholinergic receptors in the brain, which accounts for many of the psychoactive effects . Once in the bloodstream, nicotine is distributed around the body, readily crossing cell membranes and entering every tissue . It is eliminated quite rapidly, mainly through metabolism, but partly by excretion in urine . It is metabolized mostly to the oxides cotinine and nicotine-1'-N-oxide . These appear to be largely inactive and are further metabolized and excreted in urine . The plasma concentration of nicotine reduces by half every 90-120 minutes (its half-life; see Figure 1.1) . Duration of withdrawal symptoms . All nicotine is cleared from the body within a day or two of abstinence . Some people think that this must therefore be the period when smokers experience withdrawal symptoms (see Chapter 5) . The duration for most symptoms is 2-4 weeks . Estimating nicotine intake . Nicotine concentrations in the blood could conceptually be a useful index of dependence, but its short half-life means that a single measure does not give a particularly accurate picture of total intake over a day . Measurement of its metabolite, cotinine, is used instead . Cotinine has a half-life of 14-20 hours, so its concentration in the blood is more stable than that of nicotine and it can be easily measured in saliva, urine or even hair . Saliva samples are simple to obtain by means of a dental swab and are the method of choice for accurate estimation of daily nicotine intake . These estimations are not the same for urine or blood measurements . Monoamine oxidase inhibitors in cigarette smoke . There is evidence that cigarette smoke contains other psychoactive compounds which some now believe may contribute to its addictive properties . Most notably, there is at least one monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) . MAOIs reduce the rate at which monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine are broken down and have been found to reduce depressive symptoms . In the case of smoking, they might contribute to the rewarding effect of cigarette smoke or act synergistically with nicotine (which is primarily rewarding as it causes release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens - see Chapter 5) . This may help explain why people who suffer from depression are particularly likely to smoke . 
The management of leukemia is an emergency in itself, and an efficient and effective diagnostic approach is vital (see Chapter 4) . Rapid assessment of the patient to determine their suitability for treatment of differing intensities is also crucial . Neutropenic sepsis . Any neutropenic patient with signs of a systemic inflammatory reaction is likely to have sepsis . The signs and symptoms of sepsis include those shown in Table 7.1 (these will vary with age) . The principal risk factors for sepsis after cytotoxic chemotherapy are the severity and duration of granulocytopenia, the disruption of skin and mucosal barriers and insertion of catheters . The maximum recommended dose of a broad-spectrum antimicrobial should be given immediately, together with intravenous fluids and oxygen as needed . The source of infection needs to be found, and additional antimicrobials against known infections should be administered as appropriate . It is important to assess for complications of sepsis to ensure timely referral to critical care services for further support if this is appropriate . Further antibiotic and admission management may be guided by the use of scoring systems to assess the risk of developing further complications . Coagulopathy in acute promyelocytic leukemia . Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . However, APML represents a medical emergency, with considerable early morbidity and mortality at the initial diagnosis . This is primarily due to the increased bleeding risk in uncontrolled APML . Red blood cells are damaged by the microangiopathic process, resulting in the production of red cell fragments . Management of this coagulopathy is twofold . rapid instigation of anti-leukemic therapy . meticulous supportive care . Treatment with ATRA should begin as soon as APML is suspected and before a definitive diagnosis is reached . Coagulation should be monitored by daily or twice-daily measurements of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet count and fibrinogen levels . The destruction of large numbers of tumor cells results in the rapid release of intracellular metabolites into the extracellular space . This overwhelms homeostatic control mechanisms, leading to hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia . The earliest change is often hyperkalemia . Risk factors . Alkalization of urine is not advisable as this may precipitate crystallization of xanthine and hypoxanthine in the nephrons . For intermediate-risk patients, allopurinol, typically at a dose of 300 mg daily for 7 days, is sufficient . Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that can help convert uric acid to allantoin, which is more readily excreted . Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis . Leukostasis is a medical emergency . Leukostasis occurs when WBC plugs form in very small blood vessels, potentially leading to reduced flow in the capillary beds and symptoms related to the affected organ . Pulmonary and neurological symptoms are most common . In some men, leukostasis may result in a painful priapism . It may be difficult to exclude concomitant illnesses, such as pneumonia, that could also explain the clinical findings . Fundoscopy may identify retinal hemorrhages and engorgement of retinal vasculature . A rapid reduction in WBC can be achieved by leukapheresis . Differentiation syndrome . Hyperleukocytosis may also be present . In severe cases, patients may require organ support in an intensive care setting . It is important to be vigilant for differentiation syndrome because it is easily confused with concurrent illnesses, such as infections . Asparaginase-related thromboses in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . Thromboses most frequently occur in the venous system, including critical sites such as the cerebral venous sinuses and pulmonary vessels . L -asparaginase is particularly associated with a decrease in antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant that inhibits activated coagulation factors . The management of thromboses is predominantly based on the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) . 
The term 'complex regional pain syndrome' (CRPS) was coined in 1995 by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) to replace terms previously used to describe the condition . Animal studies have shown that nerve injury is followed by . an abnormally intense response of injured axons to sympathetic stimulation . Motor abnormalities, found in 50% of patients with CRPS, are most probably generated by changes in brain motor neurons . Behavioral/physical treatments aimed at motor components of CRPS in the brain have been described as 'reprogramming the brain' . Skin biopsies in the affected limbs of patients with CRPS show evidence of ongoing inflammation . Those who do not respond are deemed to have sympathetically independent pain (SIP) . The evidence is less clear for CRPS I . The percentage of pain that depends on sympathetic activity declines during the course of CRPS . As with most patients with neuropathic pain conditions, psychological distress activates the sympathetic system, and this accounts for the worsening of CRPS pain . There is no evidence of a 'CRPS personality' . Three literature reviews found little consistent information, and consequently the treatment for CRPS is often based on studies of outcomes from treatment of other neuropathic pain syndromes . Physical and occupational therapies . Physical therapy, particularly weight bearing, is one of the keys to recovery of function . Physical therapy and, to a lesser extent, occupational therapy can reduce pain and improve active mobility in CRPS I . Psychological therapy . In the authors' experience, CBT, which helps patients develop coping skills for managing stress in CRPS pain, is a crucial component of treatment and is essential in CRPS of long duration . There are no studies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in CRPS . However, from clinical experience NSAIDs help in mild to moderate pain . There are no studies of opioids in CRPS . In the presence of severe pain, opioids should be at least partially effective, as they are effective for other neuropathic pain . Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the benefits of calcitonin in patients with CRPS have shown a small effect at best . Two small single-blind RCTs reported a decrease in pain in patients with acute CRPS after treatment with corticosteroids . CRPS is associated with increased bone resorption and patchy osteoporosis . Although antidepressants are known to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, only one trial has been conducted in patients with CRPS . Although these are effective treatments for neuropathic pain, their use for the treatment of CRPS has not been evaluated, with the exception of one trial that evaluated gabapentin in 307 people with neuropathic pain, 85 of whom had CRPS types I or II . However, it was difficult to blind the study because of the burning sensation associated with capsaicin treatment . Intrathecal baclofen effectively relieves the dystonia of CRPS . Treatment early in the course of CRPS appears to be more effective than in well-established CRPS . Invasive procedures should not be considered in the early treatment of CRPS . These therapies should, therefore, be offered only in the context of multidisciplinary treatment and after careful screening and patient selection . This study did not employ intensive CBT or other rehabilitation therapies to address functional deficits . Although some case series have reported beneficial effects, there are no rigorous data for patients with CRPS . However, a trial of epidural clonidine may be appropriate for patients with intractable CRPS, and may help the patient start weight bearing and other activity focused on functional restoration . There are reports that contralateral injuries may also trigger or exacerbate CRPS . Stellate ganglion block before upper limb surgery in patients with a prior history of CRPS reduced the recurrence rate in one study . In a second study, intravenous regional anesthesia with lidocaine (lignocaine) and clonidine was also effective . On theoretical grounds a number of the pharmacotherapeutic options described above may be effective but have not been studied . Thus, early intervention to reduce the severity of CRPS is vital . In CRPS II, more than 60% of patients were unchanged after 1 year of intensive therapy . However, studies of outcome after more than 1 year of treatment with newer techniques are now needed . 
Plasma electrolyte and acid-base disturbances are common clinical problems . Sodium and water disorders . Regulation of the plasma sodium concentration by the body relies on . the balance between intake and excretion of both sodium and water . effector mechanisms such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone . Seizures and coma are common when the plasma sodium falls below 110 mmol/L . These neurological complications reflect water shifting osmotically into the brain . Adrenal failure, kidney failure and hypothyroidism must always be excluded . The sodium concentration should be monitored frequently . However, an overly rapid correction rate carries the risk of precipitating central pontine myelinolysis . However, their precise clinical role has yet to be elucidated . Hypernatremia always reflects a state of hyperosmolality . In children, muscle spasticity, fever and labored respiration may be prominent . Severe, acute hypernatremia may result in irreversible vascular damage, particularly in children . The differential diagnosis of hypernatremia requires an initial assessment of extracellular volume (Figure 2.1) . The history and physical examination should focus on identifying any underlying cause . Hypovolemic hypernatremic patients can be managed by administration of isotonic saline . In most circumstances, a correction rate of about 0.5 mmol/L/hour should suffice . Potassium disorders . Potassium is predominantly found intracellularly . Excretion of potassium is largely achieved by the kidneys, but also to a lesser extent by the colon . Transcellular shifts of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular compartments also occur . The differential diagnosis of the causes of hypokalemia is shown in Figure 2.3 . Oral therapy is preferable in chronic and/or mild hypokalemia . The clinical effects of hyperkalemia particularly affect the heart . Ventricular fibrillation is the most severe consequence . Hyponatremic and hypocalcemic patients appear most vulnerable . Disorders of calcium metabolism . The kidneys, intestine, bone and several hormones are involved in maintaining calcium balance . This is false or spurious hypocalcemia (Table 2.6) . Diagnosis always requires measurement of calcium corrected for serum albumin . In primary hyperparathyroidism the PTH is not suppressed by the raised calcium . Almost all other causes of hypercalcemia have a low or undetectable PTH level . Acid-base disorders . The normal range of the arterial pH is 7.36-7.44 . The two major organs that eliminate acid are the lungs and the kidneys . Acid is eliminated by the lungs in the form of carbon dioxide . The kidneys contribute by excreting acid as well as reclaiming bicarbonate . Assessment of acid-base status . The first step in the evaluation of an acid-base problem is to measure serum electrolytes and arterial blood gases . Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary decrease in the serum bicarbonate concentration . This occurs because of depletion or consumption of bicarbonate to buffer exogenous or endogenous generation of acid . It is often associated with defective phosphate, glucose, urate and amino acid reabsorption . In distal renal tubular acidosis, the primary defect is an inability to acidify the urine maximally . Lactic acidosis is often observed in critically ill hospitalized patients and reflects decreased tissue oxygenation . The treatment of metabolic acidosis depends on the underlying cause and the severity of manifestations . Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by a primary increase in the serum bicarbonate concentration . The most common causes are vomiting, diuretics and potassium depletion . The treatment of a metabolic alkalosis depends on identifying and remedying the underlying cause . Respiratory acidosis and alkalosis are a consequence of primary abnormalities in the pulmonary mechanisms that maintain arterial pH . Respiratory acidosis results from impairment in the rate of alveolar ventilation . Chronic respiratory acidosis is observed in individuals with chronic airway disease . Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs most commonly as a result of the hyperventilation syndrome . 
Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder, which is most commonly (but not only) caused by infection . UTI is the second most common infection after respiratory infection and, in the elderly, is the most common source of Gram-negative bacteremia . However, UTI is generally a disease of sexually active females; 1 in 3 women will develop a UTI during her lifetime, and 20% have a recurrence . In the UK, UTIs are the second largest single group of healthcare-associated infections and make up 20% of all hospital-acquired infections . In primary care, UTIs make up 1-3% of all practitioner consultations . Also see Urinary tract infections and cystitis in Fast Facts: Bladder Disorders . Causes and risk factors . Most UTIs are caused by Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (Table 9.1) . In over 50% of patients, bacteria ascend further up the ureters to the kidneys . Host factors predisposing to UTI are shown in Table 9.2 . Sexual intercourse triggers UTI in some women for unknown reasons . Urinary catheterization can also cause UTIs by introducing bacteria into the urinary tract . In infants, bacteria from soiled diapers can enter the urethra and cause UTI . Most patients respond rapidly to therapy . Hospitalization of patients with a UTI is unnecessary unless there is systemic toxicity and/or the patient requires intravenous antibiotic therapy . UTI syndromes . UTI may be either uncomplicated or complicated . Uncomplicated UTI occurs in healthy (usually) women in the community . Complicated UTI occurs because of the presence of an underlying anatomic, functional or pharmacological factor that predisposes to persistent or recurrent infection, or treatment failure (Table 9.4) . About one-third of all UTIs are complicated . The different categories, criteria for diagnosis and treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated UTIs are summarized in Table 9.5 . Acute cystitis in young women is the most common category of UTI and occurs in young, sexually active women . The urine is often turbid, and gross hematuria occurs in about 30% of patients . Uncomplicated cystitis is most commonly caused by E . Recurrent cystitis in young women . It is important to perform a urine culture to differentiate between relapse (infection with the same organism) and recurrence (infection with different organisms) . Multiple infections caused by the same organism require longer courses of antibiotics and possibly further diagnostic tests . In contrast, infections caused by different organisms are generally not associated with underlying anatomic abnormalities and do not require further investigation of the genitourinary tract . However, stopping antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with recurrence in over 50% of patients . Acute cystitis in young men is most commonly associated with underlying urologic abnormalities . The commonest urologic abnormalities that predispose to UTI are prostatic disease and outlet obstruction (see Chapter 11) and urinary tract instrumentation . A diagnosis of UTI can be made with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity if the patient has symptoms of UTI and bacteriuria of more than 10 CFU/mL of urine . In complicated UTI, further diagnostic investigations should be performed, but no further action may be necessary in younger men who respond rapidly to treatment . Between 2-10% of pregnancies are complicated by UTI; if left untreated, 25-30% of the women affected will develop pyelonephritis . Pregnancies that are complicated by pyelonephritis have been associated with low-birth-weight and premature infants . Most pregnant women with pyelonephritis should be hospitalized . Catheter-associated urinary tract infection . The risk of bacteriuria is approximately 5% per day in patients with an indwelling urinary catheter . Therefore, bacteriuria is inevitable in patients undergoing long-term catheterization . Catheter-associated UTIs account for 40% of all nosocomial infections and are the most common source of Gram-negative bacteremia in hospitalized patients . Patients with mild-to-moderate infections may be treated with an oral quinolone, usually for 10-14 days . Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary for patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medication . 
This chapter outlines the traditional approaches to the management of some of the more common problems . However, it may occur as a result of . infiltration or compression of nerves . bony destruction . intestinal obstruction . infiltration and distension of an organ . pleural or peritoneal involvement . Pain is a complex physiological and emotional experience, and not simply a sensation . This is not only conceptually useful, but can also guide treatment . They include corticosteroids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants and antispasmodics . For more information see Fast Facts: Chronic and Cancer Pain . Nausea and vomiting . Factors that must be considered include . gastric stasis and intestinal obstruction . drugs such as chemotherapy, opioids and antibiotics . hypercalcemia and renal failure . raised intracranial pressure (exempli gratia brain involvement with lymphoma) . psychological conditions (exempli gratia anxiety) . Some patients have found an acupuncture wrist band beneficial . As with other clinical problems, it is essential to search for and correct any reversible contributing factors . Potential causes of persistent fatigue include . chronic infection . intractable pain . chronic hypoxia . persistent nausea/vomiting . chemotherapy/radiotherapy . Evidence suggests that this routine is able to improve functional capacity, mood and wellbeing . Other interventions include improving nutritional status and ensuring healthy sleep patterns . Drug treatments are not universally successful and may have severe side effects . Bone-marrow suppression . This may manifest as . Anemia is defined as a reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood due to a reduction in hemoglobin . There are two treatment options: regular blood transfusions and erythropoietin treatment . Regular blood transfusions . In many centers, a blood transfusion is given when the hemoglobin level falls below a certain cut-off value . There have also been some concerns over a possible link between the use of rHuEpo prophylactically and increased mortality . rHuEpo is also very expensive and not always widely available for this indication . Bone-marrow suppression leads to a low white cell count with resulting immunosuppression . Such an infection is termed neutropenic sepsis and is a medical emergency . The use of prophylactic antibiotics and injections of growth factor should be considered . The use of prophylactic oral antibiotics was the subject of two large randomized trials . In addition, in the outpatient setting, fewer hospital admissions were required . However, mortality was unaffected and concerns about the possible emergence of resistant organisms remain . Urgent assessment is needed for a neutropenic patient with fever . Monitor temperature, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturations regularly . Take blood cultures from any indwelling catheters and from a peripheral vein . Prescribe and administer intravenous antibiotics urgently . Always check for a history of allergy before administering any medications . Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia may manifest as a nose bleed, gum bleeding or gastrointestinal bleeding . A petechial rash is also common . In addition, the following steps help to reduce the incidence of bleeding . Ensure the platelet count is sufficiently high to cover any planned invasive procedures . Tumor lysis syndrome . Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially devastating complication of aggressive lymphomas and their treatment . When a cell dies, it results in the release of . purine nucleotides, which are broken down to uric acid . Vigorous hydration with intravenous fluids should be administered and combined with careful recording of fluid balance . Serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, uric acid and creatinine should be monitored frequently . Cardiac monitoring may be appropriate in high-risk cases . Some centers will administer bicarbonate-containing intravenous fluids to alkalinize the urine, thereby reducing the deposition of uric acid . However, this strategy is controversial as it may increase the deposition of xanthine crystals that can also impair renal function . If the kidneys fail, dialysis may be needed . 
It is important to ask patients with MS about their plans for pregnancy early so as to balance medical interventions against the risks to the baby and mother; this should, ideally, result in planned pregnancies . Effects of multiple sclerosis on pregnancy . It is important to note that while a diagnosis of MS may influence pregnancy planning, it does not affect fertility . Effects of pregnancy on multiple sclerosis . Pregnancy appears to have a favorable effect on MS, with reduced rates of relapse, especially in the third trimester . Previous reports of postpartum deterioration in MS have not been seen in robust studies, and pregnancy does not appear to affect disease progression . Possible reasons why pregnancy affects relapse rate include . Treating relapses in pregnancy . There are no guidelines on the treatment of relapse in pregnancy . Disease-modifying treatments . Pregnancy should be planned and the potential risks and benefits of therapy discussed in advance . In patients with active relapsing MS, maintenance of glatiramer acetate through pregnancy has been advocated by some groups; the risk-benefit analysis should be assessed and discussed with the individual patient . This needs to be discussed with women considering future pregnancies before they start disease-modifying treatment (DMT) . Other disease-modifying therapies . The ability to breast-feed is typically not affected in patients with MS and does not affect the risk of relapse in the postpartum period . Other comorbidities associated with pregnancy . Pediatric MS is defined as MS with onset under the age of 16-18 years (depending on the study) . The majority of children with MS (> 95%) have the relapsing remitting subtype of the disease . MS is more common in girls than boys who are diagnosed after puberty . Initial presentation . Most children have a multifocal presentation, with more than one anatomic site affected . Monofocal presentations are more common in adolescents . Presenting symptoms are shown in Table 7.1 . ADEM can only be confidently distinguished from MS by adequate follow up . Other differential diagnoses in children are shown in Table 7.2 . Risk in children . The risk is almost 30% in children with an encephalopathic ADEM-like presentation . Clinically isolated optic neuritis carries a lower risk of MS - about 13% by 10 years and 22% by 23 years . Oligoclonal bands (see pages 41 -) are found in 90% of children with MS, although not all children are positive at the time of the initial lumbar puncture . They are less frequently found in children with ADEM or NMO . There is no serological test for MS . Fatigue contributing to absence from school is noted in 40% of children with MS, and seizures occur in approximately 5% . Cognitive impairment is found in approximately 30% of children with M S . The EDSS score in children rises with disease duration . On average, it takes children with MS 10 years longer to reach EDSS 7-10 than adults with MS . Progression to the secondary progressive stage of MS is primarily determined by disease duration . In children, it is important to ensure that the diagnosis of MS is firm before proceeding with treatment . A multidisciplinary approach is essential, and clear communication with children with MS and their parents is paramount . It is important that there is an understanding of the course of the disease, and that children are able to recognize the symptoms of relapse from an early age . Relapse therapy . Corticosteroid therapy is used for treatment of disabling relapses . Disease-modifying therapies . The elderly . Elderly patients with MS may have either longstanding 'conventional' adult-onset MS, or the late-onset MS subtype, which is defined as MS with symptom onset after the age of 50 years . In the latter group, a disproportionately higher number of patients have the primary progressive type of MS . Late-onset MS commonly presents with motor symptoms, while optic neuritis and sensory symptoms are relatively uncommon . In one study, the cause of death in 15% of elderly patients with MS was suicide . Similarly, cardiac comorbidities may be relevant in elderly patients considering fingolimod therapy . In this regard, a multidisciplinary team is best placed to manage the elderly patient with MS . 
On the basis of several carefully controlled studies, including randomized trials in Europe and North America, it is now appreciated that most local or distant metastases present between the routine follow-up intervals . The 'lead time' achieved by a search for asymptomatic distant disease is of little value, as it contributes nothing to the survival or quality of life of the patient . Frequency and duration of follow-up . For this approach to work, however, it is vital that the patient should be well informed and present promptly should symptoms develop . However, it may serve other purposes . Physicians may also gain more job satisfaction by regularly seeing so many patients doing well rather than seeing only those patients who have had a recurrence . The role of mammography in follow-up is somewhat controversial . The relative risk of dying from a contralateral breast cancer depends on the recurrence risk associated with the original tumor . It may be extremely small when compared with the risk of death from the original disease . For this reason, a policy of annual or biennial mammography, for example, might be a reasonable compromise . Nevertheless, it is usually difficult to justify a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy in a woman with sporadic breast cancer . In such cases, a good policy would be yearly MRI and yearly mammograms but spaced 6 months apart (exempli gratia a mammogram every March and MRI every September) . Other tests . The routine use of tumor markers or imaging tests in the search for distant metastases is not recommended . None of these tests has a high specificity, and the patient can therefore experience repeated false alarms . Moreover, even if the results are truly positive for asymptomatic metastases, this merely provides the patient with 6 months' additional notice of impending death, during which time the reintroduction of systemic therapy is of unproven value . Patients undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer require rehabilitation to address the physical and psychological consequences of surgery . Physical rehabilitation . Although the incidence of severe arm and shoulder disorders after mastectomy has largely declined with the reduction in radical procedures, minor nerve damage may still occur, and physiotherapy should be started as soon as possible after surgery . A range of exercises can be used to improve arm and shoulder mobility . The patient should be able to brush the back of her hair and fasten zips at the back of her clothing by the time she returns home, and exercises should be continued after discharge from hospital . Physiotherapy can also reduce the risk of lymphedema after full axillary clearance . Elastic bandaging may also be useful, and the affected arm should be elevated whenever possible, particularly at night, and protected from knocks . Breast prostheses are an important aspect of physical rehabilitation after mastectomy, and can also strongly influence psychological rehabilitation . A light, temporary prosthesis can be used for the first few weeks until the wound has healed . A suitable permanent prosthesis can then be selected from the wide range available, according to the required size, shape and adherence to the chest wall . New developments in materials technology have overcome many of the disadvantages of traditional silicone prostheses (exempli gratia Duette, which uses two different types of silicone to produce more natural movement, and Harmony, which has a silky surface) . Many hospitals have a nurse or physiotherapist trained in the use of breast prostheses . Psychological rehabilitation . Breast cancer imposes considerable psychological stress and trauma . The initial diagnosis and preparation for surgery can produce a period of emotional turmoil in which rapid mood swings are accompanied by immense disruption to the woman's lifestyle . By contrast, the patient may be euphoric during the immediate postoperative period, possibly due to relief of uncertainty and anticipation of a return to normal life . Most women eventually develop coping skills, enabling them to live a normal lifestyle . This does not seem to be related to the type of operation; anxiety and depression appear to be as common in women undergoing conservative surgery as in women undergoing mastectomy . It is possible that while women undergoing conservative surgery are less concerned about the mutilating effect of surgery and perceived loss of femininity, they are more worried than mastectomy patients about the possibility of recurrence . Psychological support is available from a number of sources . nurse counselors . self-help groups . national organizations . Specialist nurse counselors can offer advice and emotional support throughout the processes of diagnosis and treatment, and can identify patients with psychological problems requiring treatment . 
PTCL is invariably fatal within a few months without treatment . First-line treatment offers the most realistic chance of achieving cure . There is no standard 'one size fits all' treatment - the therapeutic approach varies across and within individual countries and for defined disease entities . PTCL subtypes that require distinct treatment strategies are discussed separately (pages 56-9) . First-line treatment for nodal PTCL . Intensified regimens have been used in an attempt to overcome the poor outcomes seen with CHOP . Modifying CHOP . Swedish population data also demonstrated a progression-free survival (PFS) advantage with CHOEP in younger patients . CHOP + alemtuzumab . In line with other studies of brentuximab vedotin, a correlation was not found between response and level of CD30 expression . Seventy percent of the trial participants had systemic ALCL, which does not reflect typical clinical practice but was a regulatory condition for the trial . Alternative chemotherapy backbones . Cell surface expression of these drug efflux pumps may rapidly transport anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids out of the lymphoma cell, causing resistance . Chemotherapeutic agents that bypass this resistance mechanism have therefore been explored as alternative first-line strategies . Treatment of limited-stage PTCL . Very few patients present with limited-stage nodal PTCL, and there is a paucity of data guiding clinical management . The decision to reduce chemotherapy and use radiotherapy requires careful consideration of toxicity and risks . Radiotherapy alone is highly unlikely to provide adequate treatment for most cases . Treatment of specific subtypes . ALK + ALCL . Young age is a major influence on the favorable prognosis of ALK + ALCL . As described above, recent data demonstrating benefit with CHP + A is likely to define a new standard of care for ALCL . Breast implant-associated ALCL that presents with seroma only, with no evidence of tissue involvement, can often be managed expectantly by careful observation after capsule removal . Involvement is bilateral in about 5% of cases, providing a basis for removal of the contralateral implant . Implant replacement should be avoided wherever possible . The roles of brentuximab vedotin and chemotherapy in breast implant-associated ALCL have not been clearly defined . All cases should be reported to the appropriate regulatory agencies and, where possible, included in national or international registries to support surveillance . Aggressive intestinal lymphomas . HSTCL is extremely rare and highly aggressive, with limited evidence to guide treatment decisions . More intensive regimens, especially those containing etoposide, are typically used, although median survival is typically less than 12 months . Aggressive ATLL is associated with poor clinical outcomes . Conventional chemotherapy alone is associated with high failure rates . Autologous stem cell transplantation does not appear to provide any benefit . These antiviral drugs have a minimal toxicity profile and can be safely combined with chemotherapy regimens . Mogamulizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CCR4 (also designated CD194) and has demonstrated significant activity in ATLL (see page 70) . Patients with aggressive ATLL should be considered for clinical trials where possible . Localized disease . Radiotherapy alone achieves an excellent initial response rate, but relapse rates are unacceptably high, suggesting that many patients have occult dissemination . Concurrent or sequential chemoradiotherapy with non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens has demonstrated significant improvements in outcomes . High radiotherapy doses are required for ENKTCL, typically > 50 Gy . Advanced disease . The two most commonly used protocols are SMILE (see Table 5.2) and AspaMetDex . Aggressive NK cell leukemia . Historically, involved-field radiotherapy was used, which encompasses anatomic boundaries including whole lymphatic regions . Consolidative radiotherapy to sites of bulk (> 7.5 cm) remains conventional practice . The role of PET-CT imaging to identify patients where radiotherapy can be safely omitted is as yet unclear . CNS prophylaxis . Response assessment . The limitations of diagnostic biomarkers in robustly predicting outcomes have driven the search for dynamic response markers . 
The risk for developing depression is related to a combination of factors . The proportion of people in the population who are (or have been) depressed - termed prevalence - varies between studies . This relates largely to whether prevalence is measured in relation to the course of a lifetime or some other time period, or at a current point in time (termed point prevalence) . Good-quality surveys using standardized interviews have been conducted in many countries to identify prevalence . Twelve-month prevalence relates to whether the individual survey participant has experienced features that meet the diagnostic criteria for an episode of depression at any time over the past 12 months . A systematic review of depression prevalence studies reported a pooled 12-month prevalence of 4.1% . Point prevalence . Studies that have used diagnostic interview methods have generally found point prevalence rates for depression in adults of 2-4% . Changes over time . There is conflicting evidence as to whether depression prevalence has increased over time . Rates in older and younger people . The same relationship between age and risk of depression (and other mental disorders) was identified by national surveys in Australia and the USA . Studies in a range of settings have identified a strong association between current or past abuse and depression . Socioeconomic adversity appears to predict the persistence of depression, with community epidemiology studies and examinations of depression management in primary care identifying this risk association . There are inconsistent findings concerning the relationship between ethnicity and depression prevalence and incidence . Studies of minority ethnic populations in New Zealand and Australia have found higher rates of depression in Maori and Aboriginal peoples . Depression in health professionals . Similarly elevated rates of depression have been found among nurses in studies in Canada, the USA, Europe and China . Migration, mental health and depression . Several studies have identified higher rates of depression among migrants - for instance, among foreign students compared with those from the same country as the educational institution . Related diagnoses . Milder forms of depression have been distinguished from major depressive disorder using terms such as subsyndromal depression, subthreshold depression and minor depression . Experiencing subthreshold symptoms of depression also increases the risk of developing depression that meets full diagnostic criteria, although cohort studies have indicated that the risk of progression to major depression is highest among people who have persistent depressive disorder . Persistent depressive disorder occurs less commonly than depression, with a typical lifetime prevalence of 6%, and a point prevalence of 1-3% obtained from surveys in the USA and European countries . Bipolar disorder is far less common than depression . International population studies, including the NCS-R, have found broadly consistent rates for this disorder . A similar proportion of people meeting criteria for 12-month depressive disorder also met criteria for 12-month anxiety disorder (57.5%) . Age at onset . The age at onset is an important aspect of the description and understanding of lifetime disorders . Hence, the overall prevalence continues to increase through middle age, with a more gradual increase thereafter . Although anxiety disorders have a markedly younger age of onset than depression (the median onset age for anxiety disorders is 11 years), these often develop a shared morbidity with depression in later adulthood . Depression course . At least half of all people affected by depression experience more than one episode . A pattern of repeated episodes - including recurrence or relapse - may be the commonest expression of depressive disorder . Several studies indicate that depression recurrence may be a typical feature: the NCS-R found that for more than 90% of people identified with depression, this was a recurrence rather than an initial episode . On average, individuals with a history of depression will have five to nine separate depressive episodes in their lifetime . There is evidence that few episodes of depression persist beyond 1 year, with several community studies noting that 80% of individuals experiencing an episode had recovered by this time . There is conflicting evidence as to whether early onset of depression is predictive of a recurrent course . Impact of depression . This is not necessarily related to increased depression incidence or the age at onset becoming younger . Indeed, the evidence for an increased prevalence of this mood disorder in adolescents appears weak when appropriate international population studies are pooled . A significant part of the burden of depression relates to impairment of work function . Depressive disorders account for almost half of all claims attributed to a mental disorder . As well as reducing quality of life, this is likely to increase the risk for depression recurrence or persistence, as interpersonal relationships act as a buffer between adverse events and depression . 
Urinary tract obstruction . Urinary tract obstruction or obstructive uropathy is defined as complete or partial obstruction of the flow of urine at any level of the urinary tract from the kidneys to the urethral meatus . Urinary tract obstruction is a relatively common cause of community-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI) (10% of cases) with an incidence of 23 cases per million population . Urinary tract obstruction has a bimodal age distribution, and is common in children and the elderly (> 60 years of age) . In children, congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract are particularly common, and include pelviureteric junction obstruction and vesicoureteric junction obstruction, such as an ectopic ureter, ureterocele or posterior urethral valves . Urinary tract obstruction can be classified according to cause (congenital versus acquired), duration (acute versus chronic), degree (partial versus complete) and location (upper versus lower urinary tract) . Major causes are summarized in Table 11.1 . The functional effects of urinary tract obstruction are influenced by the level, severity and duration of obstruction . Short-term complete infravesical obstruction is invariably associated with AKI together with an enlarged bladder, hydroureter and hydronephrosis . The level of obstruction and its duration governs the clinical presentation of urinary tract obstruction (Table 11.2) . If the obstruction is complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI) then symptoms associated with the infection are also usually present (see Chapter 9) . Urinary tract obstruction should be sought in any individual who presents with kidney failure of unknown cause . Sudden onset of complete anuria is highly suggestive of urinary tract obstruction, and ultrasound examination is the preferred diagnostic investigation . However, hydronephrosis is not always caused by obstruction . Hydronephrosis should be categorized as either obstructive or non-obstructive . With obstructive hydronephrosis, the degree of dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system may be an insensitive indicator of the severity of obstruction . Some patients with acute complete obstruction may initially have mild or no hydronephrosis, because of the brief duration of the obstruction, low urine production or external compression from a retroperitoneal process . Thus, a normal ultrasound examination does not exclude obstruction . In acute obstruction, the kidney cortex is intact, whereas chronic obstruction usually leads to marked thinning of the cortex . Failure to visualize the proximal ureter suggests obstruction at the pelviureteric junction, whereas a dilated ureter indicates an obstruction downstream, often at the level of the bladder . Therefore, it is essential to examine the entire urinary tract when hydronephrosis is present . complete obstruction . obstruction in a solitary kidney . associated sepsis . acute kidney injury . More definitive surgical intervention will depend on the cause, type and duration of obstruction . Tumors of the urinary tract . Tumors of the urinary tract can involve the kidney, ureters, bladder, prostate or urethra . Only tumors of the kidney are discussed here . Benign kidney tumors . There are broadly four categories of benign kidney tumor: mesenchymal, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal, renal cell, and metanephric (Table 11.4) . Mesenchymal tumors . Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign mesenchymal neoplasm, and is considered by some to be the most common benign renal tumor . Renal cell tumors . Papillary adenomas are the most common renal epithelial tumor, often incidentally discovered at postmortem examination . These tumors are histogenetically related to Wilm's tumor . Malignant kidney tumors . The most common malignant tumors are renal cell carcinoma and renal pelvic tumors in adults, and Wilm's tumor in children . Renal cell cancers often present late and have a relatively poor prognosis . These tumors present early with hematuria or obstruction, and are often associated with similar tumors in the ureters and bladder . The tumors may contain fibrous tissue, bone and fat . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors interfere with both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, resulting in reduced tumor vascularization and cancer cell death, and ultimately tumor shrinkage . 
New digital tools, such as digital biomarkers, can capture an unprecedented amount of information about users, including fine-grained behavioral and physiological states . Many of these tools are non-invasive and collect data passively, which is certainly more convenient but also runs the risk that people do not understand how much of their digital footprint is being collected or shared . Recently granted patents include a shopping cart that monitors your heart rate and Alexa's new ability to apparently diagnose your cough . Data collected from such technologies could be used by a doctor to make a clinical decision or by an insurer to approve or deny a claim . Society needs to decide how to create systems that will deliver real benefits while protecting citizen privacy and safety . For example, there is a lot of excitement in the healthcare community about using these tools in postmarket monitoring, or surveillance, to track metrics like safety monitoring and efficacy . Although many of these surveillance techniques in healthcare are still in the early stages, security researchers in the tech world are understandably cautious . Put simply: personalized medicine holds great promise for humanity, but it is not possible to have personalized medicine without some amount of 'surveillance' - indeed, they go hand in hand . Similar data have been used to create 'health risk scores' for the opioid crisis, determining who gets access to what types of care . Many biases may not come to light until after more rigorous testing; for instance, researchers have found that Fitbits and other wearables may not accurately track heart rates in people of color . The biases in these types of algorithms are starting to become better documented, exacerbating health disparities - and yet our society lacks clear regulatory interventions or punishment for misuse . We have all heard about the 'Internet of Things' (IoT) . What is coming next is the 'Internet of Bodies' (IoB) - a network of smart devices that are attached to or inside our bodies, as defined by Professor Andrea Matwyshyn . Most of the digital tools we have discussed fit within the IoB paradigm . Matwyshyn argues that using the human body as a technology platform raises a number of legal and policy questions for which regulators and judges need to prepare . Our society needs better social contracts with tech platforms that have accessible and meaningful informed consent processes baked into the product itself and can be tailored to adapt as user preferences change over time (Figure 6.1) . Security and compliance . Today, with the rise of connected products, even a few vulnerable lines of code can have a profound impact on human life . infrastructure, across 150 countries . Vulnerabilities in connected technologies can be exposed by either black hat or white hat hackers . Black hat refers to a style of breaking into networks for personal or financial gain, often illegally without the owner's permission . White hat hackers, also referred to as security researchers, perform a style of ethical hacking on mission-critical networks and will employ the policies of coordinated disclosure to the network owner if vulnerabilities are found . Risk prioritization protocols . Implementing protection policies . Software bill of materials . Most modern software is not written completely from scratch and includes common, off-the-shelf components, modules and libraries from both open-source and commercial teams . The FDA has been investing more time and guidance around sharing SBOMs in both pre- and postmarket settings, and so have medical device makers like Philips and Siemens, and healthcare providers like NY Presbyterian and the Mayo Clinic . The Hippocratic Oath for Connected Medical Devices . As monitoring and surveillance tools become mainstream, it is critical to have secure and ethical checks and balances . For example, on graduation from medical school, soon-to-be physicians take the Hippocratic Oath, a symbolic promise to provide care in the best interest of patients . While the FDA has not called out the HOCMD by name, in the 3 years since it was published, the FDA has incorporated elements from the five principles across its pre- and postmarket cybersecurity guidelines . The manufacturers brought over 40 medical devices for white hat hackers to test and attack . The Mayo Clinic set up a model hospital environment where security researchers were able to be in an immersive hospital setting and executed a number of security challenges simulating a real environment . These types of collaborations between regulators, industry and researchers build stronger and more resilient systems for patients and the public health system at large . Other initiatives . For instance, Health and Human Services (HHS) sponsors the Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) joint Cybersecurity Working Group (CWG) . 
Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary passage of urine during sleep in children aged 5 years old and above . Primary nocturnal enuresis is urinary incontinence that occurs during sleep in a child who has never regularly been dry at night . It is often referred to as 'bed-wetting' and is a common condition that can cause difficulty for both child and family . Nocturnal enuresis occurs in approximately 20% of 5-year-olds, 10% of 10-year-olds and 1% of 15-year-olds . The majority of children affected are fully continent during the day . The condition is usually self-limiting and children generally become dry at night spontaneously as they get older . Nocturnal enuresis has a number of different etiologies (Table 8.1) . If nocturnal enuresis persists beyond 9 years of age, the child should undergo an evaluation . A comprehensive urologic history should be taken to exclude any associated conditions that may require treatment . The specific gravity of an early-morning urine sample should be measured to identify those who may benefit from antidiuretic hormone (ADH; desmopressin) treatment . A frequency/volume bladder record (see 2 . vi and Figure 2.3) is one of the most important tools in the investigation and management of primary nocturnal enuresis . It can be used to assess the severity of the problem and also provides a baseline against which the effects of treatment can be measured . Urodynamic studies should be reserved for the child with diurnal symptoms that fail to respond to conventional treatments . Many different treatments have been tried for nocturnal enuresis, with varying degrees of success . The success rates of common treatments are shown in Table 8.2 . However, most parents and children ask for treatment because of the inconvenience and social difficulty that bed-wetting causes . If the child wets the bed at a particular time of night, a waking regimen may be of benefit . Behavioral therapy and biofeedback are useful non-pharmacological treatments . Pharmacological treatment . However, it can be useful if a child is sleeping away from home . Only 1% of adolescents (by age 15 years) still experience nocturnal enuresis, and 15% of these become dry with each subsequent year . Occult neurological dysfunction may be responsible for enuresis in a small number of patients . After the age of 18 years, patients with persistent enuresis due to detrusor overactivity that does not respond to non-surgical treatment could be offered treatment with botulinum toxin or bladder augmentation (see 4 . Nocturia and nocturnal polyuria . Nocturia is defined as waking from sleep once or more to void . Nocturnal polyuria is a contributory factor in up to 83% of patients with nocturia . Overactive bladder is estimated to be a contributing factor in 17-33%, and the incidence of nocturia in patients with overactive bladder is estimated to range from 50-80% . The frequency/volume bladder record (see 2 . vi and Figure 2.3) is the most useful tool for investigating nocturia: it will provide information about the number of night-time voids and fluid intake, particularly in the evening and night . Urodynamic studies can be carried out to identify detrusor overactivity . Treatment of nocturia should be on the basis of identified underlying causes . Simple measures can be implemented, such as reducing evening and nighttime fluid intake . Treatment of sleep apnea can improve nocturia . Pharmacological treatment aims to shift the diuresis to the daytime . However, it can cause hyponatremia, and there is a risk of exacerbating congestive cardiac failure, particularly in the elderly; some therefore consider it not generally suitable for patients over 65 years of age . If treatment is commenced, it is important to measure serum electrolytes beforehand and 1-3 days after commencing treatment, as hyponatremia can develop rapidly . A trial of antimuscarinic agent (see Table 4.3) is likely to be beneficial only if the nocturia is associated with significant nocturnal detrusor overactivity . Having a patient take the drug at bedtime may help to decrease nocturia . Nocturnal symptoms . 
Other reports have cited autonomic dysfunction and a variety of gray matter changes in the brain as risk factors for psychosis . Different reports have cited different brain regions . Cognition is the most significant risk factor for psychosis in drug-treated patients . A literature search found that dementia was a risk factor for hallucinations but not delusions . People with PD also develop the same age-associated problems as their peers, id est macular degeneration and glaucoma . Although hearing loss is common in the age group of most patients with PD, there have been no reports of an association with auditory hallucinations . This does not mean there is no association . It has been implicated as a risk factor for PDP, particularly for visual hallucinations . One report described transient delirium with psychosis in 7 of 22 patients with PD who underwent DBS-STN . Psychosis was also reported in 5 of 26 cases in a chart review of DBS outcomes in older patients (all over age 58) . In another study, 28% of patients who underwent DBS-STN developed psychosis in the 5 years after implantation . The genetic aspects of non-motor symptoms in PD are only just beginning to be investigated, hampered by the fact that most patients with PD are not genetically tested . Of those that have had genetic screening, only a small percentage have been found to have a gene related to PD . Thus, the reports on genetic PD have large gaps in their data . Common gene mutations . The most common genes found to be related to PD so far are the LRRK2 and GBA genes . Like all genes, these have different frequencies in different populations . However, there are over 100 different LRRK2 mutations associated with PD . The most common is the Gly2019Ser variant, which is associated with 2% of patients with PD in the USA, about 5% of patients with PD in general, about 20% of Ashkenazi Jewish patients and about 40% of people of North African Berber Arab descent . LRRK2 mutations are associated with a lower likelihood of psychosis than mutations in the GBA gene (see below) . GBA mutations may also be associated with the development of dementia and psychosis: the risk of dementia was found to be increased eightfold and the risk for psychosis threefold compared with non- GBA mutation carriers . As dementia is also an independent risk factor for psychosis in people with PD, it is not clear if the gene is a primary or secondary risk factor for psychosis . Rare gene mutations . Several rare gene mutations have been identified in patients with PD, some of which have been associated with psychotic syndromes . SNCA mutations are associated with a greater prevalence of psychotic symptoms than in non-genetic PD . About 25-33% of reported cases have psychotic features . Cases of psychosis in patients with PD who have PINK1 mutations are rarely reported . Serotonin genes . However, one small study did not find any association between either of these polymorphisms and psychosis in people with PD in the absence of dementia . An additional 21% developed psychotic symptoms after treatment with PD medications, but the distinction between PDP and schizophrenia was not made . No autopsy confirmation of PD could be found . Two sisters with onset of PD at age 20 were found to have a mutation in the PLA2G6 (PARK14) gene . Prior to PD they had normal cognition, with psychosis typical of PDP developing on treatment of motor symptoms [Klein 2016, personal observation] . Other case reports also describe patients with young-onset PD and psychosis with this genetic abnormality, which is usually associated with neuroaxonal dystrophy . Most studies have found no correlation between the APOE gene and PDP . Conflicting associations with PDP have been reported for the MAPT gene . The major risk factor for PDP is medication (Table 3.2) . All the medications that treat the motor symptoms of PD are associated with hallucinations, delusions and delirium . Many patients with PD use marijuana derivatives for a wide spectrum of symptoms, including sleep problems, pain, tremor and anxiety . Psychosis in untreated patients . Rarely, patients with PD who have never received any PD medications have reported hallucinations, but this is uncommon . When the psychosis develops early, it is difficult to know if it is PDP occurring without medication or DLB . Tapering medications . 
Typical atrial flutter is defined as cavotricuspid isthmus- (CTI) dependent, whereas atypical flutter includes all other atrial flutters . Typical atrial flutter is a circuit confined to the anterior portion of the right atrium with a 2:1 atrioventricular block (an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute [bpm] and a regular ventricular response of 150 bpm related directly to the atrial rate), and characteristic flutter waves showing a saw-tooth aspect in the inferior leads, and a positive P wave in V1 . A QRS rate of exactly 150 bpm should raise suspicion of atrial flutter . The diagnosis of typical or atypical atrial flutter is usually made by reviewing the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing the flutter waves . Other than atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter is the most common arrhythmia seen by cardiologists . Patients who have AF may initially present with typical atrial flutter, and only later develop AF . In typical atrial flutter, the circuit is critically dependent on the CTI, an area of slow conduction in the right atrium (see Figure 1.9) . Other types of atrial flutter, referred to as atypical atrial flutter, occur mostly in patients with scarring in the atrium (exempli gratia after radiofrequency ablation or previous heart surgery, or those with structural heart disease) . Atrial flutter characteristically has a saw-tooth appearance of flutter waves on the baseline in the 12-lead ECG (see Figure 1.9) . In common counterclockwise atrial flutter the P waves are inverted in the inferior ECG leads II, III and aVF . In clockwise atrial flutter (less common) the re-entry loop cycles in the opposite direction and thus the flutter waves are upright in II, III and aVF . Atypical atrial flutter includes all other types of atrial flutter on the 12-lead ECG . Clinical presentation . Atrial flutter can be asymptomatic or may present with palpitations, breathlessness, tiredness or frank heart failure . Anticoagulation therapy is based on the same risk factors as those for AF (see Chapter 9, page 125) . Pharmacological treatment . In acute cases, pharmacological cardioversion can be performed with intravenous ibutilide or pronestyl . A class Ic antiarrhythmic agent such as flecainide or propafenone is generally contraindicated in patients with atrial flutter because of concern about slowing the atrial rate with these potent Ic agents, which slow conduction, and, paradoxically, may allow the ventricular rate to increase . Oral sotalol is often used in patients with atrial flutter as it has the combined action of an antiarrhythmic and a beta-blocker, but QT considerations and renal excretion limit its use in women and the elderly . In the chronic setting, atrial flutter often responds poorly to drug therapy . Direct-current cardioversion is highly effective for atrial flutter, requiring generally lower energies than for AF . The same safety features for performing cardioversion for AF apply equally to atrial flutter, mainly consisting of patients being anticoagulated before cardioversion, as well as properly synchronizing the direct-current shock to the R wave . This enables safe cardioversion . After cardioversion, anticoagulation should be continued . Anticoagulation is generally advised for at least one month after cardioversion . Radiofrequency (catheter) ablation is recommended as the treatment of choice for CTI-dependent atrial flutter . The procedure can be performed during constant atrial flutter or in sinus rhythm with pacing from the atrium or coronary sinus . Most centers are now performing ablation as first-line treatment . After ablation, the prognosis for patients with typical CTI-dependent atrial flutter is excellent . In patients with atypical atrial flutter, recurrences are more common because of scarring of the atria . Up to 30% of patients with either type of atrial flutter develop AF late after a successful flutter ablation and may require further treatment; atrial flutter and AF often coexist . 
Cysts of the biliary tree can be congenital or acquired . Cysts involving the biliary tree may be isolated or multiple, and dilation of the biliary tree can be intrahepatic or extrahepatic . More than 70% of patients with choledochal cysts have an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction, with a long common channel . Biliary cysts are more common in East Asian countries . Symptoms and signs . The classic triad of pain, jaundice and an abdominal mass is seen in only 10% of patients and is most common in infants, who may also present with raised bilirubin or failure to thrive . Common symptoms in adults include chronic intermittent abdominal pain, intermittent jaundice and acute cholangitis . It is commonly associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis and may also be associated with renal cysts . This disease belongs to a group of hepatic fibropolycystic diseases and is a hepatic manifestation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease . This is a rare disease that is generally transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner . It is more commonly diagnosed in Asia, particularly in young people (younger than 22 years) . The disease affects about 1 in 1 million people . Pruritus may be present and there may be intermittent abdominal pain . Partial hepatectomy may be performed in patients with disease limited to one lobe . Patients who develop end-stage portal hypertension may require liver transplantation . giganta) and roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides) are the parasites most commonly involved in this disease . Strictures may also affect the extrahepatic biliary system . The left hepatic system is more commonly involved, but the reasons for this are unclear . The disease is more common in individuals with low socioeconomic status living in rural Asian communities . Symptoms and signs . This is a useful initial test when the disease is clinically suspected . Computed tomography may show dilated ducts, abscesses, stones or bilomas and may also be useful in mapping the extent of the disease . Stones recur in 30% of patients . Surgery may involve cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration; in a minority of patients (usually those with left hepatic disease), partial hepatic resection may be feasible . Hepatic failure may occur due to cirrhosis . AIDS cholangiopathy . AIDS cholangiopathy is a disease syndrome in patients with AIDS that is characterized by biliary obstruction due to strictures caused by opportunistic infections . Symptoms and signs . The most common symptoms and signs include right upper quadrant pain and diarrhea; jaundice and fever also occur . Liver function tests reveal the cholestatic picture, which may be normal in some patients . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography has not been widely evaluated in patients with AIDS cholangiopathy, but may be useful as a diagnostic test . Medical treatment for infection (if the causative agent is identified) does not usually affect progression of this disease . In addition, AIDS cholangiopathy usually occurs in patients with advanced AIDS, and as such their survival is not likely to be determined by this condition . Ursodeoxycholic acid may help a small percentage of patients . Endoscopic treatment . Sphincterotomy may be performed in patients with papillary stenosis and abdominal pain or jaundice . It provides pain relief for 23-70% of patients, but does not change strictures in the biliary tree . Primary sclerosing cholangitis . Up to 70% of patients with PSC may also have ulcerative colitis . Patients with PSC have an increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma, estimated at 1% per year . The natural history of PSC is variable . The mean age of presentation is between 40 and 50 years and the disease is more common in men than women . Symptoms and signs include pruritus, jaundice, fatigue and abnormal liver function tests . Patients may present with symptoms and signs of end-stage liver disease and portal hypertension . Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with PSC and end-stage liver disease . 
Immune-mediated TTP . The reported annual incidence is 6 per million (UK TTP Registry) and 1.74 per million (Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry) . Individuals with iTTP tend to be young women; the median age is 43 years and there is a female predominance of 73% . The major ethnic groups affected by TTP in the UK are white (64%) and African-Caribbean (27%) . The etiology of most iTTP is primarily idiopathic (76%); secondary precipitants include infection, associated autoimmune disease, pregnancy, HIV and, rarely, drugs . Congenital TTP is also an ultra-rare disorder with, in the last 15 years, 73 confirmed cases described in the UK TTP Registry . An additional 123 cases have been identified in the international Hereditary TTP Registry . Individuals from Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa have been enrolled in the international Hereditary TTP Registry, with first disease recognition recorded between birth and 70 years . The Registry has detected 98 different ADAMTS13 mutations (see below) . Immune-mediated TTP results from an acquired deficiency of a cleaving protease for von Willebrand factor (VWF),, now identified as ADAMTS13 . This severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 function can result in the accumulation of ultra-large VWF (UL-VWF) in the plasma, which tethers platelets and results in platelet-rich thrombi within the endothelial surface of the microcirculation (Figure 1.2) . These microthrombi can affect multiple organ systems, leading to tissue injury and a MAHA . The mechanism of ADAMTS13 deficiency is autoimmune, with autoantibodies (typically immunoglobulin [Ig]G) targeting ADAMTS13 . Antibodies can target different domains of ADAMTS13, but most people have antibodies that bind epitopes in the N-terminal domain . The main mechanism by which autoantibodies contribute to ADAMTS13 deficiency is thought to be direct inhibition of ADAMTS13, but increased clearance of ADAMTS13 also contributes . Congenital TTP . ADAMTS13 is located on chromosome 9q34, containing 29 exons and encompassing 1427 amino acids . The mutations are autosomal recessive, with individuals being either homozygous for a mutation (36%) or a compound heterozygote (64%); the main disease-causing mutations are frameshift, missense and nonsense . Mutations have been reported throughout the ADAMTS13 gene . Importantly, in cTTP there is no functional inhibitor of the ADAMTS13 protease . There are typically two peaks seen in clinical presentation: one in childhood, with a median age of 3.5 years; and one in adulthood, which is typically related to pregnancy (median age 31 years) - in individuals who present in adulthood, 69% of cases are associated with pregnancy . The type of mutation identified has been shown to differ between age groups, with pre-spacer domain mutations (see Figure 1.1) leading to earlier symptom development in childhood . The most commonly reported mutation in the UK is rs142572218 (exon 24 R1060W missense mutation), which typically has a later onset of presentation . The international Hereditary TTP Registry found the most common mutation to be rs387906343 (exon 29, c.4143_4144dupA, p . Glu1382Argfs*6) . A larger proportion of compound heterozygous carriers of c.4143_4144dupA (p . Glu1382ArgfsTer6) have overt disease before 3 months of age compared with carriers of homozygous mutations . 
Breast cancer is an enigmatic disease . The risk of breast cancer begins at puberty and rises slowly until the perimenopausal years, when it increases dramatically, eventually leveling off at about the age of 75 years . Women who do not start menses, seldom get breast cancer . Breast cancer stage appears to be a biological property of the tumor rather than simply an expression of anatomic spread . The natural history of breast cancer is determined by the stage at diagnosis; thus, the risk of recurrence of a stage II tumor is inherently higher than that of a stage I tumor . When breast cancer recurs, it can show a variety of presentations, depending on the time to relapse and the site of recurrence . The anatomic distribution of the disease shows several curious clusters . Bony metastases can wax and wane for years . Occasionally, the disease is explosive in both time and distribution, mimicking an infectious process . Breast biology . To appreciate the significance of the observations outlined above, it is helpful to consider the development of the human breast and breast cancer as a biological process . It is, perhaps, a truism to suggest that breast cancer is the result of a subtle imbalance in the complex regulatory cycles to which breast tissue is exposed . It is the combination of such 'host' and tumor factors that will determine the clinical pattern of the disease . The incidence of breast cancer is age related perhaps because multiple defects are involved; the clinical stage and pattern of disease are functions of these defects . Moreover, cancer as a process extends beyond the cancer cell . Breast cancer is fundamentally different (Figure 3.4) . The risk of recurrence, on a proportionate basis, remains constant for life and is determined by the initial stage of the tumor . Moreover, periods of increased recurrence risk 2-3 years after diagnosis have been observed . The treatment guidelines presented in Fast Facts: Breast Cancer have been derived from a classic model of the disease, which is now evolving rapidly . As breast cancer is more fully understood as a systemic regulatory disease with events at the time of surgery critical for outcome, treatment strategies will change, and perhaps the enigma will begin to dissipate . Structure of the breast and surrounding tissues . The blood supply to the breast has two main components . Benign breast disease . Although a lump is the first symptom in 80-90% of cases of breast cancer, about 80% of lumps are due to benign breast disease (Table 3.1) . Solitary cysts are among the most common benign breast tumors in women aged 35-55 years . Fibroadenomas account for 13% of all breast tumors and are most common in women under 30 years of age, in whom they account for 60% of palpable lumps . Excision is considered appropriate in older women to avoid the risk of overlooking breast cancer, unless the diagnosis has been confirmed by image-guided core biopsy . Breast cancer . Histologically, breast cancers are characterized by groups of abnormal cells in a matrix of normal fibrous tissue . Ductal carcinomas account for over 90% of breast cancers . Lobular carcinomas account for approximately 8% of breast cancers . Such tumors may occur at several sites, either in the same breast or in both breasts . Natural history of breast cancer . At one extreme, albeit rare, women may present with massive involvement of the axillary nodes or even bone-marrow infiltration and a virtually undetectable primary tumor, and die of breast cancer before the primary disease is clinically apparent . Furthermore, despite apparently successful treatment, women can relapse and die up to 20-30 years after the initial diagnosis . Curiously, irrespective of the disease-free interval between diagnosis and relapse, the subsequent behavior of the disease becomes predictable . Nomenclature of breast cancer . The traditional adjective used to describe breast cancer - 'invasive' - is a tautology and is unnecessary . Accurate clinical staging for breast cancer has always been considered essential as a guide to prognosis and treatment . Current methods of clinical staging . cancer-math . When should staging investigations be performed? Patients diagnosed with early operable breast cancer should not have investigations to see if the cancer has spread . All national and international guidelines recommend against routine staging for T1-2 and N0-1 disease . It is reasonable to describe the natural history of breast cancer in terms of growth, invasion and metastatic potential . 
DNA bases . Human DNA comprises about 3 billion bases . Nucleotides and DNA structure . A gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the creation of a gene product, either RNA or protein . Genes are built up of DNA . Some genes act as instructions to make proteins . However, many genes do not code for proteins . In humans, genes can differ in size ranging from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million bases . The Human Genome Project calculated that humans have between 20 000 and 25 000 genes . Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is utilized to synthesize a functional gene product . Non-coding DNA . Only about 1% of DNA is made up of protein-coding genes; the other 99% is non-coding . Although non-coding DNA does not provide instructions for making proteins, it is essential to the function of cells, particularly the control of gene activity . Non-coding DNA contains sequences that work as regulatory elements, determining when and where genes are turned on and off . Enhancers provide binding sites for proteins that help activate transcription . Silencers provide binding sites for proteins that repress transcription . Barrier insulators prevent structural changes in the DNA that would otherwise repress gene activity . Other regions of non-coding DNA encode specific types of RNA molecules . The cell cycle . The centromere contains specific types of DNA, which are tandem repetitive sequences (satellite DNA) . MtDNA contains 37 genes, all of which are essential for normal mitochondrial function . The remaining genes provide instructions for the development of tRNA and rRNA, which primarily help assemble amino acids into functioning proteins . Gene mutations . A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene . Gene mutations have variable effects on human health, depending on where the mutations occur and whether they modify the primary function of essential proteins . The general types of mutation are described below and/or illustrated in Figure 1.5 . A missense mutation is a change in one DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein made by the gene . A nonsense mutation is also a change in one DNA base pair . Instead of substituting one amino acid for another, the altered DNA sequence prematurely signals the cell to stop building a protein - this type of mutation results in a shortened protein that may function wrongly or not at all . An insertion changes the number of DNA bases in a gene by adding a piece of DNA . As a result, the protein made by the gene may not function properly . A deletion changes the number of DNA bases by removing a piece of DNA . The deletion may alter the function of the resulting protein or proteins . A frameshift mutation occurs when the addition or loss of DNA bases changes a gene's reading frame . The resulting protein is usually non-functional . This type of mutation may alter the function of the resulting protein . This type of mutation can cause the resulting protein to function inadequately . Point mutations have a variety of effects on the downstream protein product . Point mutations in multiple tumor suppressor proteins cause cancer . Genomic alterations in cancer . Base substitutions/single-nucleotide variants are the simplest type of gene-level mutation . Copy number alterations are somatic changes to the chromosome structure that result in a gain or loss of copies of DNA sections . These are prevalent in many types of cancer . Many cancers exhibit chromosomal rearrangements . Oncogenic mutations . Tumor suppressor genes . TP53 is the gene that codes for cellular tumor protein p53 . Tumor protein p53 regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair and metabolism changes . TP53 mutations are the most frequent mutations in patients with cancer, occurring in approximately half of all cancers . Other examples of tumor suppressor genes include the retinoblastoma gene, RB, and PTEN . An agnostic biomarker is present across many tumor types . ctDNA is tumor-derived fragmented DNA in the bloodstream that is not associated with cells . Liquid biopsies detect tumor cells or tumor cell products that are released from metastatic sites or the primary tumor . 
Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease . Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is a common inherited multisystem disease in which patients develop multiple bilateral kidney cysts, cysts in other organs and non-cystic renal manifestations (Figure 8.1) . Most patients (85-90%) have a mutation in the PKD1 gene, which encodes the protein polycystin . Mutations in a second gene, PKD2, can also cause APKD . Cysts arise from focal dilatation of the tubules . Clinical features of APKD are summarized in Table 8.1 . APKD affects about 1 in 1000 people, making it one of the commonest inherited diseases . It is a common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, progression is slow in most patients, and not inevitable . Cysts are easily identified by ultrasound examination . Cysts are not commonly seen in the fetus or in children . They are, however, found in a number of conditions other than APKD, such as simple cysts, tuberous sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau disease . The absence of cysts in young people does not exclude the diagnosis, because they can form late in life, and screening of asymptomatic individuals is therefore not recommended before the age of 20 years . No specific treatments are available . Cyst hemorrhage is usually self limiting . Upper tract infection should be treated with antibiotics that will penetrate cysts (fluoroquinolones) . Stones are managed as in patients without APKD (see Chapter 10) . Liver cysts occasionally need resecting . A recent placebo-controlled trial has suggested that treatment with the vasopressin receptor antagonist tolvaptan may lead to a slower rate of cyst growth and reduced rate of renal function loss in the short term . It is caused by mutations in type IV collagen, which result in structurally defective glomerular (and other) basement membranes . Hereditary nephritis presents with hematuria and proteinuria, causes deafness and ocular changes, and in some individuals progresses to chronic kidney failure (CKD), but with a wide variation in phenotype . There are three genetic forms of hereditary nephritis . mutations in the COL4A5 gene causing X-linked Alport's syndrome (80% of patients) . mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4 causing autosomal-recessive disease (15% of patients) . mutations causing autosomal-dominant inheritance (5% of cases) . Hematuria may be observed at birth . The absence of hematuria during the first 10 years of life makes it likely that a child will not be affected . About 50% of patients are deaf, males being more commonly affected than females . Deafness is usually progressive from birth onwards; in its early stages, the hearing deficit is detectable only by audiometry . The most common ocular abnormalities are anterior lenticonus and/or pigment abnormalities of the macula . In lenticonus, the central portion of the lens protrudes into the anterior chamber, which causes progressive opacification of the lens leading to loss of visual acuity and progressive myopia . Lenticonus is usually associated with deafness and appears during the second to third decade of life . The differential diagnosis of hereditary nephritis includes various primary and secondary glomerular diseases causing hematuria, especially thin basement membrane disease and immunoglobulin (Ig)A nephropathy, and abnormalities of the urinary tract . However, the clinical usefulness of molecular genetic analysis is limited; it is time consuming and expensive and only identifies 50% of mutations . Thus, the most common approach still focuses on making a histological diagnosis, followed by screening family members by urinalysis and genetic counseling . Recent work shows that some patients with thin basement membrane lesions have a heterozygous deficiency of either alpha3 or alpha4 type IV collagen chains . Although usually benign, some families show slow progression to CKD . No specific treatments are available . Ultimately, many patients progress to ESKD, requiring dialysis or transplantation . Transplant survival rates are similar to those for patients with other diagnoses (see Chapter 12) . Loss of hearing is likely to be permanent . 
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma . The typical phenotype is CD2 +, CD3 +, CD4 −, CD5 −, CD7 +, CD8 −, although CD8 + cases have been identified . Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . The neoplastic cells express pan T-cell antigens but usually lack CD7, and most cases are CD4 + . CD25 is usually strongly expressed whereas neoplastic cells are negative for ALK and cytotoxic markers . CD30 can be expressed, particularly in transformed cases . Neoplastic cells express FoxP3 and CD25, indicating peripheral CD4 + T regulatory cells as the cell of origin . The cytology in PTCL-NOS is often pleomorphic (Figure 2.1) - most cases comprise a mixed population of medium to large cells with a high proliferation rate . Clear cells are frequently present . The expression of pan T-cell antigens (id est those found on all T cells) by malignant cells is highly variable in PTCL-NOS, with reduced or no expression of CD5 and CD7 in up to 80% of cases . Loss of CD3 and CD2 expression is less common . The expression of CD52 varies widely (35-100%), and 32-58% of PTCL-NOS cases express CD30 (an activation marker for B and T cells) . Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma . The markedly atypical malignant cells occasionally resemble Reed-Sternberg cells . small cell (5-10%), with small to intermediate sized, often perivascular, cells . More than one pattern may be seen . ALCL is a CD4 + T-cell lymphoma (although rare CD8 + cases have been reported), characterized by strong and robust expression of CD30 in the cell membrane and Golgi bodies, particularly in the larger cells . Expression of other T-cell markers varies widely between patients . ALK + ALCL most commonly expresses CD2 and CD5, whereas ALK − ALCL most commonly expresses CD2 and CD3 . Expression of EMA and CD45 varies widely and is more common in ALK + ALCL . It typically presents with seroma around the implant, and tumor cells are found within the capsule . Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma . Gene expression studies show a similar gene expression pattern to Tfh cells, a distinct CD4 + T-cell subset, suggesting that this is the cell of origin in AITL . Malignant T cells may represent only a minor component of the infiltrate, so accurate diagnosis can be challenging . The morphology of AITL can overlap with reactive entities and other lymphoid malignancies such as classic Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell-rich large B-cell lymphoma . B cells infected with EBV may resemble Reed-Sternberg cells, potentially causing confusion with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (Figure 2.4) . Mutations in important genes involved in TCR signaling (CD28, PLCG1, FYN) have also been found . Although TCR-related genes are mutated individually at relatively low frequencies across AITL cases (1-15%), up to half of all AITL harbor at least one TCR mutation . Other follicular T cell-related lymphomas . Although these cases do not meet the full clinicopathological criteria of AITL, they have some histological findings in common with AITL, express Tfh cell markers and have a similar mutational profile to AITL . Follicular PTCL is a rare subtype with a follicular infiltrate of malignant T cells (Figure 2.6) . Tumor cells usually express alphabeta-TCR, lack CD4 and CD8 expression and are negative for CD56 . CD30 is often expressed . Tumor cells are typically positive for both CD8 and CD56, and most express gammaδ-TCR . The malignant infiltrate is monomorphic without the typical inflammatory background seen in EATL . Indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract is extremely rare . It usually expresses CD8, although CD4 and NK cell markers may be seen rarely . Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma . 
The assessment of depression in women needs to take into account the sociocultural and personal factors that may be contributing to the onset, and more importantly the maintenance, of depression . These need to be addressed to allow depressive symptoms to respond to treatment . Perinatal depression . It is a time when women are at particular risk of developing depression and also experience a high risk (30-40%) of having a postpartum relapse of bipolar disorder . For many women this will be accompanied by significant financial stress . Depression in pregnancy or antenatal depression . Prevalence and risks . Until recently, little attention had been paid to depression arising during pregnancy as it was thought that most episodes of depression arise postpartum . However, we now know that 6.5-12.9% of women will experience antenatal depression, emanating either from a pre-existing depressive episode or a new-onset episode . However, it remains to be seen what type and severity of depression can have such adverse outcomes . Notwithstanding this, it is important that women with depression in pregnancy receive appropriate treatment, as antenatal depression is a predictor of subsequent postnatal depression and can lead to the previously noted poor obstetric outcomes . This has led some to recommend that women should be screened for depression over the perinatal period, and in some countries, screening programs have been implemented using questionnaires such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or the Patient Health Questionnaire to identify women who may have depression . Identification of depression during pregnancy is important, but a detailed assessment is required to clarify whether depression is indeed present . Many women can have transient symptoms of depression over the perinatal period and overpathologizing them can be as harmful as missing a diagnosis of depression, as it may lead to the application of unnecessary interventions . The clinical assessment of depression in pregnancy needs to take into account the fact that some 'depressive' symptoms can arise from physical symptoms associated with pregnancy, such as fatigue, insomnia, appetite and weight change, and loss of libido . Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe option for pregnant women with severe and unremitting depression . Pharmacological treatment . The management of depression over the perinatal period is much the same as the management of depression at other times . Abruptly stopping the medication can lead to a depressive relapse and the medication may need to be restarted . However, in some cases it may be the initial presenting symptom of postnatal depression . Postnatal depression . This is an episode of depression that develops within the first year after childbirth, a similar clinical picture to depression at other times in life . Depressed mothers may be insensitive to their infants and can interact poorly with them . As with depression during pregnancy, a stepwise approach is taken to the diagnosis and management of postnatal depression, comprising . It is estimated that postnatal depression is not recognized or adequately treated in about half of women with the condition . This is an ideal opportunity to use the 'Whooley' questions to identify women with postnatal depression (see Table 4.2) . Once the depression has been identified, the woman should be invited to talk openly about her problems . Psychological treatment . The clinician can provide basic psychoeducation, explaining that postnatal depression is common (10-15% of women experience it) . Pharmacological treatment can be considered for women with more severe postnatal depression . An important issue to consider is their safety for breastfeeding mothers, and many women may prefer not to take an antidepressant if breastfeeding . Other management considerations . Women with severe depression may require admission to a specialized mother and baby unit, especially when there are concerns about the safety of the mother and the infant . Suicidal ideation should be checked with new mothers, particularly those with severe depression . Some women with severe postnatal depression, especially if they are agitated or have psychotic symptoms, may require ECT . They will need to have a minimum of five symptoms, including one of several specified core symptoms (Table 5.5) . The assessment of PMDD requires confirmation of the presence of symptoms over a number of cycles . Perimenopausal depression . Depressive symptoms as well as episodes of depression can commonly emerge during the menopausal transition . When women present with perimenopausal symptoms, it is worthwhile asking about their mood as well as reviewing the physical symptoms . The addition of hormone replacement therapy to the antidepressant may be sufficient to overcome the depressive episode . 
Gritty, itchy or watery eyes are very common complaints, and in general are annoying to the patient rather than dangerous . Routine referral is appropriate for patients with gritty, itchy or watery eyes if their discomfort persists or worsens . Gritty eyes or foreign body sensation . Causes of a gritty eye include a corneal or conjunctival foreign body, corneal ulcers (infective and non-infective corneal ulcers, such as marginal keratitis), corneal abrasions, dry eye, blepharitis, inturned eyelashes, ectropion and entropion . The most common causes of gritty sore eyes are dry eye and blepharitis or a combination of the two . Foreign body in the eye . If a patient complains 'there is something in my eye' (foreign body sensation), they may well have a foreign body on the cornea (see Chapter 11) or conjunctiva, or between the upper or lower eyelid and the eyeball . If a foreign body is not visible, remember to evert the upper and lower lid (see Chapter 1) and look for a foreign body under the lid . Corneal ulcer . Causes may be infective (viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan) or non-infective . These patients require urgent (same day) referral to an ophthalmologist . Be aware that a dendritic corneal ulcer, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), may present as a gritty eye rather than a red painful eye, because the virus makes the cornea partially numb . Dry eye may cause a slightly red eye, or the patient may have normal-looking eyes . Corneal abnormalities caused by dry eye are only visible on slit-lamp examination . Dry eye should be suspected if the patient complains that their eyes feel 'dry' or 'burning', or if the sensation worsens during reading (due to the decreased blink rate we all have while reading) . If the eyes are uncomfortable or 'stuck down' on waking, a lubricating ointment at night as well as drops during the day can help . Blepharitis is a chronic inflammation of the eyelid margins (often with crusting at the base of the lashes and redness of the lid margins) that can occur at any age . Patients commonly complain of chronic eye irritation, grittiness and itching . Patients with blepharitis are also predisposed to the development of chalazia (eyelid lumps caused by inflammation of the oil glands; see page 85) and marginal keratitis (small peripheral corneal ulcers) . Blepharitis is often associated with dry eye . Patients with blepharitis may have an anterior component with crusting of the base of the lashes ('dandruff' of the lashes) but also a posterior component called meibomianitis, an abnormality of the oil component of the tear film . Thick oil is produced, which blocks the meibomian gland openings, causing sterile inflammation and redness (as well as predisposing to chalazion formation) . This poor oil layer allows the watery component to evaporate, resulting in a dry eye . There are also 'lid hygiene' packs that can be purchased from pharmacies . However, patients with recurrent inturned lashes should be referred for more permanent treatment . Ectropion and entropion (outward or inward rolling of the eyelid, respectively) can both present with foreign body sensation . Eye irritation occurs in ectropion because the outward drooping lid exposes the eye and can also cause watering, while in entropion the inturned lid's lashes abrade the cornea . The symptoms of entropion tend to be more severe due to the lashes rubbing the eye . Itchy eyes . Eye itch without redness is most commonly due to allergic conjunctivitis; however, mild itching may also be caused by dry eye or blepharitis . Watery eyes (epiphora) . The patient complains of constant or intermittent 'tears in the eyes', which sometimes stream down the cheeks and require frequent eye wiping, without eye redness, pain or irritation . In adults, watery eyes are usually due to age-related blockage of the tear ducts or to ectropion, both of which can be corrected with surgery . 
Kidney stones are a common cause of morbidity in the Western world, affecting 10-20% of the population during their lifetime and leading to hospitalization for 1 in 1000 of the general population each year . Over 80% of kidney stones occur in white men; they are much rarer in women and black people . The peak age of onset for kidney stone formation is 20-30 years, and the recurrence rate is high - up to 50% within 5 years . There are four main types of kidney stones (Table 10.1) . The most common stones contain calcium salts, and may be calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or a mixture of both . These stones often recur and are most often seen in patients with an associated anatomic abnormality . Uric acid stones have a high recurrence rate . Rarely, drugs can crystallize in the urine and form stones (exempli gratia indinavir, triamterene, aciclovir) . Risk factors . Reduced levels or absence of urinary inhibitors of stone formation, such as citrate, also favor stone formation . Urinary infection with a urease-splitting organism is a key factor in struvite stone formation . Calcium stone disease . The major cause of calcium stone formation is excessive urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria), with or without hypercalcemia . The most common cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism . The primary abnormality appears to be impairment in renal tubular resorption of calcium, but it also reflects increased absorption of dietary calcium and excessive bone resorption . Other less common etiologies include hyperuricosuria in about 10% of patients, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia and medullary sponge kidney . Non-calcareous stone disease . Bacterial urease degrades urea into ammonia (and subsequently ammonium), resulting in alkaline urine, which favors the formation of triphosphate ions and reduces the solubility of struvite . Uric acid stone formation is also critically dependent on the urinary pH . Chronic diarrheal syndromes, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and jejunoileal bypass surgery are associated with reduced urinary pH and thus a greater propensity for uric acid stone formation . Hyperuricosuria is most frequently observed in states of purine overproduction, such as myeloproliferative states and glycogen storage diseases . Clinical features . Clinical presentation varies depending on the location, size and number of stones . Renal colic is typically spasmodic, lasts several minutes, is localized to the flank and radiates down to the groin, accompanied by nausea and vomiting . It often occurs in the middle of the night or early morning while the patient is sedentary, and its severity has been described as akin to or worse than childbirth . On the other hand, larger stones may present with painless obstruction or back pain . Stones that reach the ureterovesical junction often present with renal colic accompanied by urgency and frequency . Stones located in the kidney calyces may be completely asymptomatic . Patients with renal colic are often writhing in excruciating pain and restless . The presence of fever usually heralds an accompanying UTI . Otherwise, the physical examination may be completely unremarkable . Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, blood chemistry including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN or serum urea) and creatinine, and urinalysis (Table 10.3) . The presence of a UTI, particularly with pyelonephritis, will be associated with leukocytosis . Hematuria and pyuria are usually present . Imaging should include a radiograph of the kidney, ureters and bladder, and an ultrasound or a non-contrast CT scan (Figure 10.1) . Low-calcium diets are to be avoided . Surgical management depends on the size, location and number of stones (Table 10.6) . Indications for urologic surgery are . stones more than 5 mm in diameter . stones impacted for more than 24 hours . evidence of significant obstruction . evidence of infection . Obstruction may require percutaneous nephrostomy . 
Acute headache . Brain imaging, including neurovascular studies, may be needed as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurement and analysis and further evaluation by a neurologist . Chronic headache . The headache diagnoses in Table 12.2 should be considered . The history should note, as for any other pain, a general medical history, including a detailed pain history (Table 12.3) . It is important to note whether the headache corresponds to any cycles (menstruation, weekends, circadian) or particular exposures (fumes, smoke, foods, etc) . Diagnostic testing, particularly brain imaging, may be appropriate . Pathophysiology and associated signs and symptoms . However, it is useful to consider migraine headache and tension headache differently for therapeutic reasons . An increase in excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and reduced intracortical inhibition are associated with meningeal inflammation and peripheral sensitization leading to dilation of cerebral vessels and pain . There appears to be a genetic predisposition to migraine in some patients . Hence caution against the regular, daily or almost daily use of these drugs for headache control is advised . Sinus headache is caused by allergy- or infection-induced sinus inflammation with subsequent blockage and increased pressure . Psychological processes . Physical examination . Palpation of a very prominent and sensitive superficial temporal artery can point to a possible diagnosis of temporal arteritis; this is a crucial diagnosis because if left untreated blindness is a likely complication . As emotional factors often trigger tension or migraine headaches, psychosocial assessment for stressors or psychiatric comorbidity is important . Diagnostic testing, particularly brain imaging, may be appropriate to rule out intracerebral causes . Diagnostic tests . In occipital neuralgia, sometimes neural blockade of the occipital nerves can help with diagnosis . Administration of indometacin (indomethacin) results in complete relief of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) and this effect continues with long-term treatment . Cluster headache diagnosis may be aided by the autonomic features and at least partial response to inhaled oxygen . This approach is based on understanding the phenomenological pattern of each individual's headache, as in Figure 12.1 . Second, once prodromal or actual migraine symptoms occur, a stepped-care approach should be taken (Table 12.5) . Botulinum toxin injections have been reported to be successful in some case series, but the clinical trials are equivocal; a trial should be reserved for treatment-resistant patients . For intractable migraine and occipital neuralgia, non-invasive methods of vagal neurostimulation and transcranial magnetic neurostimulation may serve as useful adjuncts to more conventional therapies . Trials of more invasive forms of neuromodulation in the form of temporary insertion of suboccipital electrodes result in about 50% of these patients proceeding to permanent implantation of electrodes with a pulse generator . Tension headache . Once precipitants are identified, intervention strategies should proceed as follows . For positional headache, such as that activated by poor ergonomics at a computer terminal, positional and seating changes, stretching routines and icing can be helpful . At the onset of headache, modulation techniques are initiated, such as stretching and icing, and relaxation techniques . Usually analgesics such as NSAIDs or paracetamol suffice, although other medications such as tramadol may be tried in more severe forms . The medical custom in some countries, such as the USA, includes use of pills, combining a barbiturate, butalbital, and caffeine with paracetamol or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) . Occipital neuralgia . Pressure over occipital nerves or nerve injury due to trauma or surgery may activate headache symptoms . Nerve block may eliminate headache symptoms temporarily or for extended periods . Such blocks do not accurately predict the outcome of trial suboccipital nerve stimulation (see above) . Myofascial headache . Treatment includes awareness and avoidance of triggers, such as posture and stress . Analgesics are used with usual cautions . Trigger point injections may give short-term benefit, and physical therapy may be helpful . 
Diabetic ketoacidosis . Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes . DKA consists of the biochemical triad of ketonemia, hyperglycemia and acidemia . Of the infective causes, urinary tract infection and pneumonia predominate . Alcohol or drug abuse may also contribute . Missed insulin injections account for about 25% of cases . Often, psychological factors are implicated if there has been deliberate insulin omission or non-compliance with insulin therapeutic regimens . The incidence of DKA is slightly greater in females than in males . Eating disorders can be an important contributory factor . Clinical presentation . Hyperglycemia results principally from increased hepatic glucose production with a contribution from increased renal glucose production and decreased glucose uptake into peripheral tissues . Abdominal pain is common (40-75% of cases), occasionally mimicking an acute abdomen . Failure to recognize this, particularly if operative intervention is undertaken, may have fatal consequences, though the possibility of an acute abdomen should not be overlooked . Acetone may be smelled on the breath as a fruity odor and acidosis may result in labored Kussmaul respiration . The conscious level varies between normality and mild alteration of consciousness: coma is relatively rare . In addition to plasma glucose and arterial blood gas measurements, all patients should have a full blood count, and urea, electrolytes and creatinine should be measured . The initial potassium level may be low, normal or high (most frequently elevated) in the face of a profound potassium deficit . Patients with initial hypokalemia are considered to have severe serious total body potassium depletion . Potassium loss is caused by a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space in exchange for hydrogen ions . Much of the shifted extracellular potassium is lost in the urine because of osmotic diuresis (compounded by further loss due to vomiting) . Until recently, standard management of DKA focused on reducing blood glucose levels with insulin and intravenous fluids . There is still universal agreement that the initial cornerstone of treatment is fluid replacement and insulin administration . The intravascular volume should be expanded to correct a typical deficit of 100 mL/kg of water with intravenous isotonic saline, which will also improve renal perfusion . If the initial systolic blood pressure is below 90 mmHg, 500 mL of normal saline should be given over 15 minutes . In the presence of significant hypernatremia, isotonic saline can be replaced with 0.45% saline . The aim is to replace total body deficits of water and electrolytes, with half the estimated deficit being replaced in 12-24 hours (see Table 11.3) . Insulin is best administered by low-dose continuous intravenous infusion . The insulin infusion rate can be determined by hourly capillary blood glucose measurements to maintain the blood glucose level between 5 and 10 mmol/L (90 and 180 mg/dL) . Measurement of venous pH and bicarbonate rather than arterial values is also advised . The use of bicarbonate to correct acidosis is not recommended as studies have failed to show any benefit from bicarbonate administration, which may actually be harmful . Once ketoacidosis is resolved, hyperglycemia has been corrected and the patient has improved clinically and is eating and drinking, subcutaneous insulin administration can resume . The overall mortality is 3-4% . It carries a mortality of 40-90% and manifests as a decreasing level of consciousness, with headache, seizures, papilledema, bradycardia and respiratory arrest . Treatment is with intravenous mannitol . Mechanical ventilation may help to reduce swelling of the brain . In the UK, 70-80% of diabetes-related deaths in children under 12 years of age are caused by cerebral edema . Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state . Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is one of the two serious metabolic derangements in diabetes that may be life-threatening . It is less common than DKA, but carries a higher mortality rate (10-20%) . Clinical presentation . Typically, patients have symptoms of diabetes and weakness . Attention should be focused on the underlying cause when identifiable . 
TTP was originally characterized by a pentad of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, fluctuating neurological signs, renal impairment and fever . However, advances in our understanding have demonstrated that TTP can present without the full pentad . TTP is now defined by MAHA with moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia and associated organ dysfunction (neurological, cardiac, gastrointestinal and renal involvement) without an alternative explanation . The diagnosis is confirmed by an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL . Typical laboratory findings . The median platelet count is typically 10-30 x 10 /L at presentation . Significant renal impairment usually points to a diagnosis of HUS . It is a sign of poor prognosis, being associated with a sevenfold increase in mortality rate compared with TTP patients with normal troponin levels . CT or MRI of the brain should be considered in these patients, but it is important that imaging on admission should not interrupt plasma exchange therapy . A stool culture can rule out an important differential diagnosis, infection-associated HUS, which is typically associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and may present with bloody diarrhea, TMA and marked renal impairment . Unlike TTP, management is usually supportive rather than with plasma exchange . Other precipitating causes to be excluded are autoimmune disorders and pregnancy . A virology screen should be undertaken prior to exposure to plasma products, to exclude HIV and other viral-associated TTP . Prior to therapy, blood samples should be taken for ADAMTS13 assays, specifically . ADAMTS13 activity . ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL confirms the diagnosis of TTP . Samples taken immediately following plasma therapy may give a falsely elevated ADAMTS13 activity . However, it has been shown that in more than 78% of cases, samples taken after 3 days of plasma exchange still had an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL . Other TMAs, by definition, will not have an ADAMTS13 activity below 10 IU/dL or the presence of significant anti-ADAMTS13 IgG . A persistent deficiency (< 10 IU/dL) of ADAMTS13 activity, with no evidence of inhibitory autoantibodies, suggests a diagnosis of cTTP . Individuals can present in the neonatal period, childhood or adulthood, with presentation typically associated with a trigger, such as infection, vaccination or pregnancy . Immune-mediated TTP can be categorized according to the presence (secondary iTTP) or absence (primary iTTP) of a precipitating factor . Both groups are defined by ADAMTS13 activity below 10 IU/dL and the presence of ADAMTS13 autoantibodies . Both also require immediate therapy with plasma exchange and steroids . Primary iTTP accounts for approximately two-thirds of iTTP cases . Treatment of secondary iTTP can be tailored toward the underlying precipitant: for example, discontinuation of the implicated drug or highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) in HIV-associated TTP . Screening for severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . A number of scoring systems have been developed to help predict the likelihood of severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity and differentiate TTP from other TMAs . In conjunction with clinical assessment, it calculates the risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and therefore allows early rapid screening of patients who can benefit from plasma-based therapy . 0-4: low risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . 5: intermediate risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . 6-7: high risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . Internal validation of the scoring system demonstrated that when all three criteria were present, specificity was 98.1% and positive predictive value was 98.7%, minimizing the number of false-positive diagnoses . Although a creatinine level above 150-200 µmol/L (1.70-2.25 mg/dL) and a platelet count above 30 x 10 /L usually exclude a diagnosis of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency,, there are a minority of people with TTP who present with platelet counts above 30 x 10 /L or marked renal impairment . Basing therapy decisions on these cut-offs alone runs the risk of potentially missing these atypical presentations . Therefore, the diagnosis of TTP should be definitively confirmed by analysis of ADAMTS13 activity . 
Current therapies, particularly inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, have excellent efficacy in controlling symptoms and preventing asthma exacerbations in nearly all people with asthma . In studies of asthma in the community, asthma symptoms are frequently poorly controlled, but this is most usually due to lack of availability of, or failure to take, recommended asthma controller therapies . However, not all patients achieve complete control of symptoms . For instance in a dose-escalation study using fluticasone dipropionate and salmeterol, only 72% of individuals achieved complete control of symptoms with high-dose inhaled therapy, although most of these had partially controlled asthma symptoms . However, some individuals with asthma suffer from severe symptoms or may have progressive loss of lung function, together with frequent exacerbations despite optimal inhaled therapy . These individuals are considered to have refractory asthma . Community studies of asthma severity suggest that approximately 5% of asthma sufferers have severe asthma and continue to suffer from uncontrolled asthma despite treatment . This group truly represent 'refractory' asthma and will fall into step 5 of the GINA treatment guidelines . International collaborative efforts are currently under way to study these individuals as they represent the major burden of asthma with respect to costs associated with emergency medical visits, hospitalizations and medications . In considering whether a patient has 'refractory asthma' it is important not to escalate treatment without careful consideration of whether it is warranted . Three questions should be asked prior to diagnosing refractory asthma . Is the patient receiving their medication? . Does the patient really have asthma? . Does the patient have severe asthma? . Is the patient receiving the medication? . Many obstacles exist to patients receiving and taking their medication . The degree to which a patient takes a medication as prescribed is termed 'adherence' and is an important goal of treatment for chronic diseases . It is estimated that fewer than 50% of individuals with an illness take medication exactly as prescribed . Asthma medication may be difficult to obtain for reasons of cost or inconvenience . Asthma places a considerable burden on individuals and appears to be more common, and more severe, in lower income groups . In some instances the financial burden of regular medication can exceed a patient's ability to pay for it . Patients can then decide not to take, or 'ration' asthma medication so that they receive less than was prescribed . Non-adherence to medication can therefore be intentional due to economic reasons and other concerns surrounding medication use . Patients perform a 'cost-benefit' analysis as to whether to take prescribed medication, an analysis that includes their beliefs about the benefits of the treatment, its cost to them and the likely outcome of their asthma, and their fears about side effects (Figure 5.1) . This can be an excellent role for an asthma health educator . People with asthma may also suffer from comorbidities that render it more difficult for them to acquire and take medication . Once medication is prescribed and acquired, patients then need to use their device effectively . A major part of consultation with a patient who is not successful in achieving good asthma control should be a review of inhaler use and technique, as this can be a significant barrier to effective treatment . Routinely, the substitution of a spacer device with an MDI can improve medication delivery and consequently asthma control . So the first step in uncontrolled or poorly controlled asthma is the assessment of medication use and adherence . Patients often present with fevers, cough and sputum as well as worsening asthma . Any patient who does not respond to moderate doses of inhaled medication should undergo lung function testing to confirm a diagnosis of asthma . Does the patient have severe asthma? . A very few patients have severe asthma that continues to be unstable despite demonstrated reliable medication use . These patients will often have abnormal lung function and also suffer from frequent exacerbations . In this instance frequent continuous use of oral corticosteroids may be employed to achieve and maintain asthma control . Other monoclonal antibody therapies have efficacy in refractory asthma and may also be employed, although their use is currently restricted to clinical trials (see Chapter 9) . The presence of severe, refractory asthma is an indication for establishment of airway inflammatory phenotype . Treatment algorithms that use measures of airway inflammation suggest that there are some patients with high symptom burden but little evidence of inflammation: a dose reduction of anti-inflammatory therapies may be considered in this group (Figure 5.2) . 
The past decade has seen a significant downward shift in the stage at presentation of prostate cancer in most countries . Clinical symptoms . Patients with prostate cancer may present with a variety of symptoms (Table 3.7), many of which overlap with those of BPH . Men most often present with symptoms of BPH that are unrelated to the cancer . The possibility of prostate cancer should therefore be considered in the investigation of prostatitis-like symptoms . In rare cases, prostate cancer may extend into the corpora cavernosa . The most common presenting symptoms are shown in Table 3.8 . Early detection . In general, the earlier prostate cancer is detected, the better the outlook in terms of cure or arresting cancer progression . An increasing majority of patients present simply with an isolated increase in PSA . Causes of PSA elevation in the absence of prostate cancer are given in Table 3.3 . The median PSA and 95th percentile values for the 'normal' population at each age group are presented in Table 3.5 . Several concepts have been developed to improve the clinical value of the test in the detection of early prostate cancer . All of these have been proposed in attempts to improve the utility of PSA in the detection of early prostate cancer at a curable stage and to reduce the number of negative transrectal biopsies . A PSA density above 0.15 ng/mL has been shown to increase the specificity of the PSA test . A velocity above 0.75 ng/mL/year has been used to predict the presence of prostate cancer . However, recent studies have shown that the average PSA velocity in men without prostate cancer is 0.03 ng/mL/year, compared with 0.4 ng/mL/year in men ultimately diagnosed with prostate cancer . Age-specific reference ranges are predicated on the increase in serum PSA level with age . Studies show that patients with BPH but not prostate cancer have a higher amount of free PSA, whereas men with prostate cancer appear to have a greater amount of PSA complexed with alpha -antichymotrypsin . Prostate Health Index . This test has performed better than conventional PSA and free PSA for predicting overall and high-grade cancer in a number of studies . The value of the PCA3 test is likely to be in reducing the number of repeat biopsies . The value of PSA screening in men who are asymptomatic for prostate cancer is still highly controversial (Table 3.6) . Non-randomized data show that, since the advent of PSA screening in the USA and Europe, the proportion of men presenting with advanced prostate cancer has decreased, as has prostate cancer mortality . In one randomized study, men with clinically significant prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy had a 56% reduction in the risk of premature death from prostate cancer compared with conservative management . Disadvantages to screening include the following . The PIVOT trial showed little benefit of surgery compared with watchful waiting in men with lower-risk cancers . A large proportion of men who have a biopsy do not harbor prostate cancer, and biopsies have associated morbidity because of the risk of post-biopsy infection . The screening process may generate anxiety . The treatment of prostate cancer is associated with significant morbidity . Decisions about screening should be individualized for men younger than 55 years who have risk factors for prostate cancer (see page 8) . Early results from two large randomized studies and longer-term results from a third randomized study have been reported . The larger European study (the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC]) randomized men to screening at 4-yearly intervals or no screening . This study reported a 27% reduction in prostate cancer mortality at a median follow-up of 9 years . Prostate cancer mortality was reduced by 44% in those randomized to screening . In men who actually attended screening, prostate cancer mortality was reduced by 56% . With longer follow-up, the NNT was reduced to 12 . However, there have also been reports that the cancer volume on biopsy and grade of cancers are increasing . In the future, it seems likely that screening will be focused on men who are genetically most susceptible to prostate cancer . More than 100 'prostate cancer susceptibility genes' have been discovered . Men who are at risk because of mutations in these genes could be targeted for screening . 
Preventing asthma attacks is the most effective means of controlling asthma . Effective prevention involves identifying and avoiding risk factors and asthma triggers, together with effective patient education and adherence to a medication regimen . Patient partnerships . Included in the goals of good asthma management is the need to meet patients' goals and expectations as well as those of the health practitioners . Good asthma management means that a partnership should be established between the patient and health professional, with shared treatment goals noted in a jointly written and agreed self-management plan . This eases the pressure on healthcare personnel resources by helping patients to take responsibility for their health and improves asthma outcomes . Identifying the risk factors that trigger asthma attacks and removing the appropriate allergens and irritants from the patient's environment can reduce the frequency of symptoms and hospitalizations for asthma, and the need for medication . However, allergens should only be avoided when there is evidence that the patient is indeed allergic to that specific allergen . Animal allergens . A pet in the home to which the patient with asthma is allergic is a major risk factor for current asthma symptoms . Cockroach allergen is a major cause of asthma in some areas, particularly in inner city environments . Early identification of occupational sensitizers and removal of the patient from further exposure are important elements in the management of occupational asthma . Patients with both asthma and severe food allergies causing anaphylaxis are at particular risk of severe attacks and death . intolerance is an important cause of worsening asthma in adults . Treatment of rhinitis . Rhinitis is more common than asthma, and international surveys reveal that its prevalence appears to be increasing . It is increasingly evident that effective treatment of rhinitis can assist in the management of asthma . Topical nasal corticosteroid therapy for rhinitis in those with concurrent asthma in addition to regular controller asthma therapy can nearly halve the risk of asthma exacerbations requiring emergency treatment . Allergen immunotherapy can also be an effective treatment for severe or refractory allergic rhinitis, and an associated improvement in asthma outcomes has been shown . Such treatment may be useful in patients for whom allergen avoidance is not possible or whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional medication, or where a single allergen is especially problematic . There is some evidence that immunotherapy can prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis to asthma . Asthma management plans . Education is essential to enable patients to make the decisions needed to control their asthma . Plans should be written down so patients can refer to them (Figures 7.1 and 7.2) . A zone system, which classifies the level of asthma control according to symptoms and PEF (if available), is a useful feature of management plans . This approach helps patients to understand the chronic and variable nature of asthma, monitor their condition, identify signs of deteriorating control and take appropriate action . Moving to a lower treatment step can be considered if the patient remains in this zone for at least 3 months . This may indicate an acute attack requiring a temporary increase in medication, or an overall deterioration that requires additional treatment . Asthma symptoms are present at rest and may interfere with activity; PEF is below 60% of personal best . Patients' asthma will not be controlled effectively if they do not adhere to their medication and management plan, yet adherence studies reveal that fewer than 50% of patients take their medication as prescribed . Other reasons why patients choose not to take a medication may be unrelated to the medication (Table 7.3) . Regular consultations are necessary to give patients an opportunity to talk about their concerns, needs and expectations in relation to their asthma and its treatment . Action can then be taken to address any problems identified, and to resolve any fears or concerns that patients may have . adherence to, and concerns about, medication and the management plan . the patient's use of the controller (preventer) and reliever inhalers, PEF meter or other devices . need for emergency attendances . This includes an assessment of asthma control, including . nocturnal symptoms . the effect of symptoms on normal activity . Trained asthma educators may also be used to help patients acquire knowledge about their asthma and to address concerns that prevent use of controller medications . There is evidence that asthma education can improve outcomes of patients admitted to hospital with asthma . In general, most patients with mild or moderate asthma can be adequately managed in the primary care setting . 
Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide . The prevalence of asthma also depends on the age, geographic region and socioeconomic status of the population studied, and the study design . Several large international trials have studied asthma prevalence in adults and children . In this study, the prevalence of asthma in populations of children aged 13-14 years and 6-7 years is, on average, 13.7% and 11.6%, respectively . However, in some nations, particularly in high-income countries, prevalence in the 13-14 years age group exceeds 20%, indicating very large regional differences in asthma prevalence (Figure 2.1) . Studies have consistently shown that the prevalence of asthma increased worldwide through the 1980s and 1990s . However, in countries with a very high prevalence of asthma historically, particularly English-speaking countries, the rates have stabilized or are even falling . In contrast, the prevalence in developing countries appears to be increasing, particularly in some parts of Asia, Africa and South America . The prevalence of asthma in adults has not been the subject of such widespread global initiatives as the investigation of asthma in children . However, symptoms of wheeze occur with greater prevalence than airway hyperresponsiveness, which range from 3.4 to 28% with a median of 13% . Within a particular country, the prevalence of asthma may differ markedly between different racial and ethnic groups . Asthma appears to be more prevalent in urbanized countries; the reasons are not clear, but may include . In older age groups the reported mortality from asthma can be inflated because of comorbidities, such as COPD . In many countries, a marked increase in asthma deaths occurred in the 1960s, after which mortality decreased . Asthma in older people has also become a recent focus of attention . With the gradual reduction in asthma mortality in younger age groups, people over the age of 55 years are now the group who most commonly die of asthma - particularly in higher income nations . Insights into the extent of asthma-related morbidity come from surveys examining the severity of asthma symptoms . This study also revealed that in every region, around 30% of individuals with asthma presented for emergency medical care for their asthma annually . Further evidence of the morbidity of asthma comes from studies of hospital admissions for asthma . These show marked geographical variations in large part influenced both by asthma prevalence and the healthcare delivery system in place . the increasing prevalence of asthma . Early-life origins of asthma . Recent studies suggest that it does not . Natural history of asthma . Asthma can occur at any time in life, although it most commonly develops in infancy and childhood . Infancy (0-3 years) . Wheezing is common in the early years of life and recent studies have enabled the identification of several distinct phenotypes . The most common are . transient infantile wheeze, in which children have recurrent wheeze during the first few years of life, but rarely thereafter . episodic wheeze, where children have wheeze associated with viral infections that does not persist between attacks . Allergy, particularly to house-dust mites, is the most common feature associated with the development of asthma during childhood . By the age of 8 years, a significant proportion of children develop bronchial hyperresponsiveness and symptoms of moderate-to-severe asthma, whereas others continue to show mild intermittent asthma . Lung growth is relatively normal in most children with mild asthma, but may be reduced in children with severe persistent symptoms . Furthermore, lung function often remains impaired even when clinical signs of asthma have disappeared, and 5-10% of children with mild asthma develop severe asthma later in life . There is evidence that eczema is a major risk for the persistence of childhood asthma into adult life . Prevalence studies reveal that asthma is generally more common in boys until puberty, when more girls develop asthma and the predominance reverses . Some individuals acquire asthma in their adolescent years . As the prevalence of asthma in adults is generally lower than in children, it is evident that many children grow out of childhood asthma . Those whose asthma remits tend to have less severe and persistent asthma in childhood . Asthma acquired in childhood is more likely to remit than asthma acquired in either adolescence or adulthood . The natural history of late-onset asthma is variable . Such older people with asthma have increasingly become the focus of attention as the mortality and symptom burden of this group is high and response to controller therapy more variable . 
There are several important factors to consider before starting systemic therapy (Table 7.1) . Patient education is also important before embarking on any form of systemic therapy, particularly as all available treatments are associated with potential short- and long-term side effects . The benefits of disease clearance or improvement must be balanced against the risk of these side effects . Various agents are used in the systemic treatment of psoriasis (Table 7.2) . Therefore, the risks of systemic therapy need to be carefully considered . Many patients in the USA are routinely assessed for HIV status before systemic therapy, including receptor-targeted therapies (see Chapter 8) . Methotrexate has been used to treat psoriasis for over 40 years and remains the gold standard . Before starting methotrexate therapy, it is essential to perform . If the result is satisfactory, the initial dose regimen for methotrexate is 10-15 mg/week . Folic acid supplementation should be given concurrently to reduce side effects such as gastric intolerance and mouth ulcers (see below) . In patients responsive to methotrexate (up to 50%), an initial improvement is often noted after 4 weeks of therapy, with continued gradual improvement over the next 8-12 weeks . It is important not to discontinue methotrexate therapy abruptly because of the likelihood of destabilizing the psoriasis, which can lead to inflammatory flares . Rotation with other therapies may improve long-term remissions and reduce potential hepatotoxicity . Methotrexate is contraindicated in patients who . This includes interactions with . Side effects, such as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, are usually seen within 4-48 hours of dosing . Another less frequently noted side effect is methotrexate-induced pneumonitis . Systemic retinoids . The first systemic retinoid used to treat psoriasis was etretinate nearly 30 years ago . As with methotrexate therapy, when a reasonable improvement has been achieved, the dose can be reduced slowly . Side effects . Although not as effective as methotrexate, acitretin has fewer side effects . Careful management is required, including dose reduction, specific diet and, if necessary, appropriate drug therapy . This is perhaps of particular concern given recent epidemiological evidence that patients with severe psoriasis are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease . The most significant side effect is mucocutaneous toxicity . Ciclosporin was first reported as therapy for psoriasis in 1979 . Ciclosporin, which was approved for the treatment of psoriasis in the UK in 1993 and in the USA in 1997, has proved to be an excellent therapy for widespread recalcitrant psoriasis and is well tolerated by most patients . Wherever possible, therapy should be limited to short periods of up to 1 year, with rotation to other systemic agents, phototherapy or biological therapy in order to avoid long-term nephrotoxicity . Less dramatic results are seen in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, who often require 4 months of therapy for optimal improvement . Side effects . The most common side effects are hypertension and nephrotoxicity . Ciclosporin should be used with caution in patients who have had more than 100 PUVA treatments, because of the increased risk of skin cancer . In addition, gingival hyperplasia and increased hair growth are not uncommon side effects with ciclosporin therapy . Hydroxycarbamide is considered to be a second-line therapy for psoriasis, as improvement is slower than with methotrexate, systemic retinoids or ciclosporin . While some consider that it is underused in the treatment of psoriasis it is now rarely used . In most patients, hydroxycarbamide clears approximately 50-60% of the psoriasis . Side effects . Major systemic side effects are much less likely than with other commonly used systemic treatments . 6-tioguanine (6-thioguanine) is a purine analog antimetabolite used to treat patients with psoriasis that has been recalcitrant to other systemic therapies . Side effects . Gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting and reflux, are also common . Side effects . Receptor-targeted therapies . Other systemic therapies . These include . 
The main advantage of an interim analysis is to shorten the duration of the trial . Stopping a Phase II trial early would accelerate the drug development process . Stopping a Phase III trial early based on overwhelming evidence of efficacy would enable marketing authorization to be submitted sooner than would have been the case were the trial to run to completion . Disadvantages of interim analyses . There are several potential disadvantages of stopping trials early that must be considered at the trial design stage . Stopping rules for efficacy . At each interim analysis, a p -value calculation compares the treatment groups for the primary endpoint . For example, there may be three p -value calculations for two interim analyses and a final analysis, each of which has the potential to be a false positive . Several schemes are used to break down the type I error rate for interim analyses . Trials should not be stopped early for evidence of efficacy unless the evidence is overwhelming . For two interim analyses and a final analysis, the division of the alpha (alpha = 0.05) is 0.0006, 0.014 and 0.045 . Therefore, at the first interim analysis the adjusted significance level is 0.0006 . At the second interim analysis, the adjusted significance level is 0.014, which leaves a significance level of 0.045 for the final analysis . You will probably have recognized that the three adjusted significance levels used in the O'Brien-Fleming scheme do not add up to 0.05 . In this situation, one plus one does not equal two - the adjusted alpha levels are not additive . The adjusted significance levels control the overall potential for the false positive (the FWER) at 0.05 . If the p -value in the second interim analysis in Example 5.1 had been 0.02 it would have been statistically significant at a conventional significance level of 0.05 . Stopping the trial at p = 0.02 would have been a major mistake as it would have destroyed the control of the type I error and destroyed the trial in the eyes of regulators and journal editors . The trial would therefore have continued through to the final analysis (as shown in Example 5.2) . Other schemes . Another common scheme is Haybittle-Peto, which adjusts the significance levels to 0.001 at each of the interim analyses, again leaving most of the 0.05 for the final analysis . Under this scheme, after two interim analyses the final analysis would be conducted at alpha = 0.049 . Given that the interim analyses in Example 5.1 are correlated, the Bonferroni significance levels (0.017 for each of three analyses) would be too harsh . In fact, to have the same adjusted level at each analysis, the correct adjusted significance level would be 0.022 (and not 0.017) . Alpha-spending functions . However, the trial design may be organized in such a way that the analyses are not equally spaced, in which case the adjusted significance levels change . For example, it may be undesirable to consider stopping after 200 patients because this would limit the amount of safety data obtained . In this setting, the analyses are no longer equally spaced and the adjusted alpha levels would need to be recalculated to control the overall alpha level . Event-driven analyses . Under these circumstances, the interim analyses will also be event driven . Stopping rules for futility . In general, a futility assessment takes place reasonably early in the trial, as stopping a study for futility potentially saves a sponsor's resources . Conditional power . To judge this, the conditional power of the study is calculated . conditional power under the current trend . conditional power under the original assumption . Conditional power under the original assumption . Other futility approaches . Pros and cons of stopping for futility . The value of negative data . Premature trial cessation . Stopping a trial for futility reduces power; a trial with 30% conditional power still has a 30% chance of success, but stopping a study at that point with that conditional power diminishes the probability of a positive trial result . Some trials with low conditional power have been stopped prematurely . Indeed, the LUME-Lung 2 study in Example 5.4 is one such trial . The independent data monitoring committee . It is vitally important that interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility do not cause bias . 
Definition of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis . There is no standard definition of refractory myasthenia gravis (MG), but studies have generally utilized the criteria shown in Table 1.1 . Prevalence and incidence . Several epidemiological studies examining the incidence and prevalence of generalized MG have been performed worldwide over the past few decades, most of which have been conducted in Europe . These studies have reported a wide range in incidence rates (IR) and prevalence rates (PR) . In a large meta-analysis, the estimated IR was 5.3 per million person-years with a range of 1.7 to 21.3 . In another systematic review, the most reliable IR was 30 per one million per year . The prevalence rate has been found to be 77.67 cases per million, and a range of 15-179 per million worldwide has been reported . Both IR and PR have been shown to be increasing over time in a non-linear fashion, with both IR and PR roughly doubling around 1980 . This is most likely attributable to greater awareness and accurate diagnosis of the disease, improvements in diagnostic testing (exempli gratia antibody testing), epidemiological methodology and more effective treatment of the disorder, leading to better long-term survival . When adequately treated, most patients with MG are able to live productive lives with few or no symptoms . A distinct subset of patients, however, have very aggressive and difficult-to-control disease . These patients, who continue to have symptoms and are at continuing risk of crisis and exacerbation because of an inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, are often referred to as having treatment-refractory MG . The exact prevalence of refractory myasthenia is unknown, but it is estimated to occur in approximately 10-15% of patients with generalized disease . In a large retrospective study by Suh et al . The definition of refractory included those patients who could not lower their immunotherapy without clinical relapse, were not clinically controlled on their immunotherapy regimen, or experienced severe side effects from immunotherapy . In a recent study by Sudulagunta et al . Age and sex . The incidence of generalized MG has been found to have a bimodal age distribution, with a peak around 30 years of age and again at 50 years, with a steady rise in incidence thereafter . Female cases predominate in the younger age group and males in the older (Figure 1.1) . Juvenile MG is defined as disease with onset before the age of 18 years and accounts for roughly 10% of all cases of MG . In the Suh et al . study discussed above, the median age of the refractory group was 36 years versus 60 years in the non-refractory group . Refractory patients were more likely to be female (14 of 19) . In the Sudulagunta et al . The refractory group also had a higher percentage of females . Geography and ethnicity . In general, MG is more commonly reported in East Asia, with a higher frequency of ocular disease . There is otherwise an equal geographic distribution in the incidence and prevalence of MG in both adults and children . While all races and ethnicities are affected by MG, people of African descent have a slightly higher prevalence of the disease, which is particularly true in muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive disease . MuSK antibody-positive disease is also more commonly reported in geographic locations closer to the equator . There may be a hereditary predisposition to develop MG as there is an increased incidence of certain HLA antigens including HLA-B8, HLA-DRw3, and HLA-DQw2 in various MG populations . MuSK-antibody positivity and other clinical characteristics . Suh et al . Despite the high percentage of patients with MuSK antibodies in the refractory group, they were also more likely to have undergone thymectomy and to have had thymoma . Sudulagunta et al . Patients in the refractory group were also more likely to have thymoma, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia . The high incidence of diabetes and dyslipidemia was thought to be secondary to the higher doses of corticosteroids used in the refractory group and highlights some of the risks associated with long-term corticosteroid treatment . 
SVTs are not usually life-threatening, although they can be in rare circumstances . SVTs usually occur in young, otherwise healthy, adults, but can be seen at any age . There are surprisingly few data on the incidence of SVTs in the general population . Thus, SVTs are relatively infrequent . The characteristic feature is usually a regular narrow QRS complex on the surface electrocardiogram during symptoms of tachycardia (Figure 7.1) . Wide-complex SVTs do occur but are less common . The P wave morphology can help to localize the atrial origin of the tachycardia . Characteristically, patients complain of sudden onset of rapid palpitations . Often these feel regular, but this is not always a reliable description as patients may have difficulty telling the difference between a regular and irregular rhythm, particularly when the heart rate is fast . Associated symptoms are . sudden onset - sometimes the patient is aware of a brief run of ectopy before the tachycardia starts . sudden offset usually . feeling faint or presyncope (faintness may occur immediately at the onset or after sustained tachycardia); syncope is uncommon . Infrequently, more often in younger patients than in adults or the elderly, atrial tachycardia may be persistent . These patients do not always have associated symptoms of palpitations and, because of the incessant nature of the tachycardia, they may present with heart failure . If symptoms are infrequent and non-intrusive (exempli gratia less than once or twice a year), and provided the diagnosis is confirmed, no treatment may be indicated and the patient can be reassured . Patients often develop successful ways of stopping their SVT, such as Valsalva maneuvers, deep breathing techniques, lying down or sleeping . The patient can be given the treatment options available, so that any increase in symptom frequency can be dealt with immediately . Patients with ventricular pre-excitation (as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) should be referred to a cardiologist for risk assessment, and generally most of these patients undergo catheter ablation . These maneuvers work variably - not at all in some patients - but should be tried as they are low risk and simple to perform . The safest and easiest to teach is the Valsalva maneuver, in which a patient strains against a closed glottis . Ask patients to imagine they are straining at stool, blowing hard with the mouth closed while pinching the nose or blowing into a straw . Usually, antegrade depolarization of the ventricle occurs over the AV node . Flecainide should be avoided in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function or clinical heart failure, as the risk of proarrhythmia increases significantly . These risks are minimal when LV function is normal, as in the majority of patients with SVTs . Propafenone has partial beta-blocking actions and is generally not recommended in patients with at least moderate asthma . Propafenone should be avoided in any patient with impaired LV function . Sotalol also has partial beta-blocking actions and should be avoided in patients with asthma . Sotalol should be used with great caution in the presence of heart failure and is generally avoided in the elderly because of renal excretion . It is also used with caution in women as there is an increased risk of torsades de pointes . Patients should be warned that they will experience a flush and possibly chest pain following the injection . Drugs to be avoided . Any drug that exerts its major action by blocking the AV node should be avoided in pre-excitation syndromes such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome . Infrequently, SVT can degenerate to AF (see Chapter 9), which can cause transmission of a rapid atrial rate to the ventricles, leading to ventricular fibrillation in patients with (overt) pre-excitation . Only beta-blockers and amiodarone have an acceptable safety profile in patients with LV dysfunction; flecainide, propafenone and sotalol must be avoided . Occasionally, patients may have such a fast tachycardia that blood pressure is compromised and urgent direct-current cardioversion may be appropriate . Anesthesia or sedation is necessary unless the patient is unconscious . The prognosis for patients with SVTs is excellent . 
Examples of EDNOS diagnoses are . female patients who meet all the criteria for anorexia yet menstruate regularly . individuals who meet all the criteria for anorexia but despite significant weight loss maintain weight in the normal range . individuals who display combinations of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors but at lower frequencies than those stipulated in the criteria . EDNOS also includes two subsets of disorders that have been defined by specific diagnostic criteria and have received increasing research interest: binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES) . Hence, BED is often associated with overweight or obesity . There is increasing consent in the literature to consider BED as its own diagnostic category because of its distinct features, treatment and prognosis compared with bulimia . The overall prevalence of BED has been estimated as 3.5% in women and 2.0% in men . Compared with anorexia and bulimia, the sex ratio is less uneven, with males making up about 40-50% of EDNOS diagnoses with a BED subcategory . Age of onset for BED is slightly higher than for bulimia, ranging from 17 to 32 years, with a mean of 25 years . BED has an overall better prognosis than bulimia, however, as it responds to a wider range of treatments that target both binge eating and weight reduction . CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT) have appeared equally effective in reducing binge eating, although they do not lead to clinically significant weight loss . Pharmacotherapy has used anticonvulsant agents such as topiramate, which have been associated with a reduction in both binge eating and weight . In one study, the combination of topiramate and CBT led to an abstinence rate of 80% compared with 61% for placebo . The selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram and escitalopram, as well as the antiobesity medication sibutramine, all have appeared superior to placebo for reduction in binge frequency, weight loss and improvement of general illness severity, although long-term studies are still lacking . Night-eating syndrome is characterized by insomnia, excessive appetite (hyperphagia) in the evening and a lack of appetite in the morning . Individuals with NES wake several times throughout the night to eat, consuming over a third of their total energy intake after their evening meal . Binge eating or purging behaviors are generally not associated with this disorder, and these individuals can usually recall what they ate . In contrast, nocturnal eating/drinking syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating throughout the night with no, or partial, recollection of what was eaten . This syndrome is a combination of an eating, sleep and mood disorder . Limited research has been conducted on effective treatments for NES, but the SSRI sertraline has shown some benefit . Feeding disorders . In young children, problems with eating are called feeding disorders . These disorders are believed to reflect the relationship between parent and child, as opposed to just the child or the adolescent as is the case with eating disorders . There is no extensive literature on this subject, but the typical dyad seems to be a single, young, socially isolated, anxious mother with a difficult infant . Feeding disorder of infancy and early childhood is a problem with feeding such that a child does not eat properly, resulting in weight loss or inability to gain adequate weight . This problem must first present under 6 years of age to meet the diagnostic criteria . Rumination disorder is the regurgitation and rechewing of food in an infant or child and presents after a period of normal functioning . Onset is usually between 3 and 12 months of age . Pica is the repeated eating of non-nutritive substances such as paint, plaster, string, hair or cloth . This problem usually presents in infancy and remits in early childhood . Pica is associated with pervasive developmental disorder and mental retardation . Diagnosis and management . Feeding disorder diagnoses are only given if symptoms last for at least 1 month, cannot be explained by other medical problems and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention . Treatment includes medical interventions for malnutrition and behavioral interventions to build healthy feeding patterns . Other eating disorders . 
Bile duct cancer or cholangiocarcinoma may arise in the intra- or extrahepatic biliary system . The bifurcation of the hepatic duct (hilum) is the most common site for cholangiocarcinomas (Klatskin tumor) . Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type; molecular changes include the expression of mutant p53 and K-ras . The overall pathophysiology of cholangiocarcinoma is poorly understood . Mutations leading to cholangiocarcinoma occur in a background of chronic inflammation, leading to proliferation of mutated cells and angiogenesis . Epidemiology and risk factors . Cholangiocarcinoma occurs predominantly in patients aged 50-70 years and is more common in men than women . Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma are shown in Table 5.1 . The serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19.9 are usually elevated; however, they may also indicate other types of tumor, and can be mildly or moderately elevated in benign biliary obstruction . Transabdominal ultrasound indicates the level of biliary obstruction and sometimes the tumor mass itself (Figure 5.2) . Computed tomography will usually show the position and extent of a hilar cholangiocarcinoma along with a dilated intrahepatic biliary system, with a non-dilated extrahepatic biliary tree and a non-dilated gallbladder . A CT scan of a distal bile duct cancer will show dilation of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary systems and the gallbladder . CT scans have limited ability to determine the resectability and extent of a tumor and often need to be supplemented by additional techniques, such as positron-emission tomography (PET), to enhance their accuracy . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may provide supplementary definition of both the tumor and extent of biliary obstruction (Figure 5.3) . Other imaging modalities include endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound, which may be useful adjuncts for establishing and defining the location and extent of a tumor . The type of operation depends on the location of the tumor . A hilar lesion may be treated by local resection but usually requires a partial hepatic resection; in either case a hepaticojejunostomy is required to restore continuity of the biliary-enteric tract . Intrahepatic lesions are treated with hepatic resection . The method and choice of stent insertion depends on the location of the tumor, local expertise and whether unresectability has been clearly determined at the time of stent insertion . Randomized studies using local photodynamic or radiofrequency ablation therapy have demonstrated prolonged biliary patency and survival . Other bile duct tumors . Table 5.3 lists the various bile duct tumors . Biliary papillomatosis presents as tumorous papillary growths of the bile duct epithelium, which are usually diffuse and multiple . A large amount of mucus is produced by the abnormal biliary epithelium, causing biliary obstruction with resultant cholestatic jaundice and cholangitis . A possible association between Caroli's disease and biliary papillomatosis has been reported . Biliary cystadenoma is a rare tumor . Malignant degeneration does occur, but very little is known of the risk for this . Lymphoma of the bile duct . Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may arise from the bile duct . Jaundice may occur due to a variety of causes, including direct hepatic involvement or compression of the bile ducts by lymph nodes, as well as tumor-related hemolysis . This tumor can occur between the first and seventh decades of life . The most common lymphoma subtype pattern is large-cell lymphoma . Treatment is variable and includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery . Future developments are likely to include . improved understanding of risk factors and etiopathogenesis, especially for cholangiocarcinoma, which might be induced by chronic biliary inflammation, changing growth factor and proinflammatory cytokine expression patterns . novel biological therapies, cancer vaccines and gene therapy . 
The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) has increased in most regions of the world in recent decades . Age at first episode of pancreatitis depends on the etiology: childhood for hereditary AP, fifth decade of life for alcohol-related AP and sixth to eighth decade of life for biliary AP . The overall incidence of AP is similar in men and women but alcohol-related AP is more frequent in men (70-90% of total episodes of alcohol-related AP occur in men) . Gallstones are the most frequent cause of AP in many countries . Gallbladder polyps may also be associated with AP . Pancreas divisum has been classically associated with AP, but the relationship is controversial, as the prevalence of pancreas divisum in the general population and in patients with idiopathic AP is similar . Other obstructive etiologies . Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is associated with very poor outcomes . Other rare causes of obstructive pancreatitis are listed in Table 2.1 . Sustained heavy drinking (at least four to five drinks per day) has been associated with an increased risk of AP . No association has been found between sporadic heavy consumption of alcohol and AP . Recurrent AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis are common after a first episode of alcohol-related AP . Smoking is an important cofactor in alcohol-related AP . Mutations that have been associated with pancreatitis are listed in a database at www . Mutations affecting the digestive protease/antiprotease system . Most described mutations associated with AP affect the digestive protease/antiprotease system . Cationic trypsinogen gene mutations . In 1996, the first genetic mutation leading to pancreatitis was described by David C . Other mutations associated with pancreatitis have been described subsequently . Patients with hereditary pancreatitis due to PRSS1 mutations have an increased risk of pancreatitis during childhood, quick progression to chronic pancreatitis and a high probability of developing pancreatic cancer . It has been reported that a loss-of-function mutation (p . Heterozygous mutations of the SPINK1 gene (wild type plus a mutation) are important cofactors for developing pancreatitis . Homozygous SPINK1 mutations (mutations in both copies of SPINK1) and certain compound heterozygous mutations (different mutations in both copies) can be considered a direct, although very rare, cause of pancreatitis . Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in CTRC result in a 2.5- to 10-fold increased risk of developing pancreatitis . Compound heterozygosis involving a mutation of both CTRC and SPINK1 has also been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis . Mutations associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress . Carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1) is a pancreatic exopeptidase . CFTR mutation . While cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, certain homozygous or heterozygous mutations in the CFTR gene may be associated with pancreatitis . Interestingly, mild mutations that are not associated with cystic fibrosis may be associated with pancreatitis . These mutations may be associated with deficient hydration and thus increased viscosity of pancreatic juice, thereby reducing its flow . AP is the most frequent complication of ERCP, with an incidence of 3-4% in unselected patients . Suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, female sex and previous pancreatitis are clearly associated with an increased probability of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) . PEP may be associated with significant morbidity, increased healthcare expenditures and a mortality rate of 3% . Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and fine needle aspiration of pancreatic lesions may both be associated with iatrogenic AP . HTG is the cause of AP in 2-26% of patients (mean 9%) and 14% of patients with HTG will develop AP . In China, HTG is one of the most frequent causes of AP . This etiology seems to be associated with a worse prognosis . Infectious disease . Many different microorganisms have been associated with AP (see Table 2.1), but infectious disease is a very infrequent cause of AP, explaining just anecdotal cases . AP is a common clinical presentation of autoimmune pancreatitis . 
Where we are today . Moreover, there also seems to be substantial clinical activity in some uncommon malignancies, such as Merkel cell cancer, mesothelioma and relapsed lymphoma . It is too early to gauge the place of immunotherapy in some other common malignancies, because pivotal clinical trials are still ongoing . Clearly, a number of important issues around the use of cancer immunotherapies remain to be resolved . Some of the most important of these are highlighted here . Developments in immuno-oncology have created justifiable excitement . However, the optimal use of this multitude of therapies requires ongoing clinical evaluation, guided by appropriate preclinical models and translational science . Who will/won't benefit from treatment . Despite the clinical breakthroughs described above, at present most patients do not respond to immunotherapy, even for an approved indication . In clinical practice, the lack of precision therapy is compounded by a range of unpredictable and often serious immune-related adverse events that require careful management . Liquid biopsies with plasma-circulating tumor DNA may provide a non-invasive tool to explore this, but much more research is required in this area . In other tumor types, especially melanoma, there appears to be no such correlation . A further issue with the measurement of PD-L1 levels in patients with lung cancer has been the requirement for a core biopsy . Levels of immune proteins in peripheral venous blood samples are currently being evaluated as potential biomarkers of response . Such analyses are likely to be less useful in earlier stages of disease when inflammatory markers are less frequently elevated . However, to date, patients with lung cancer have not tolerated the same doses as those given to patients with melanoma . These combinations are now being explored in other cancer types . Optimal use of cancer vaccines and oncolytic viruses will involve . upregulation of dendritic cell, CD8+ T cell and natural killer (NK) cell functions . inhibition of immunosuppressive pathways regulated by myeloid suppressor cells and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 . Immunotherapies plus systemic therapies . Rates of grade 3 or greater toxicities were similar in the two arms . The data from the Phase III trial Keynote-189 are awaited . These proteins cause binding and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and release of proinflammatory cytokines that further activate the immune system (Figure 5.1) . A similar process may occur with radiotherapy (see below) . Therapeutic exploitation of ICD in conjunction with checkpoint inhibitors is a logical next step in combination therapies . Immunotherapies plus radiation . As well as external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy, radiation is also involved in the form of therapeutic isotopes and selective internal radiation delivery . Radiation can induce ICD, creating the potential for synergy with immunotherapies, especially the immune checkpoint inhibitors . It appears that standard scheduling of radiotherapy provides more favorable immune interaction than hypofractionated schedules . Monitoring of these associations will be useful in ongoing combination studies . Optimal timing of immunotherapy interventions . However, this was improved when an anti-CD137 antibody was added to the anti-PD-1 agent in the neoadjuvant, but not adjuvant, setting . This effect was shown to be dependent on the presence of interferon-gamma and tumor-specific circulating CD8+ cells . A number of studies of neoadjuvant therapy in various tumor settings are under way . Optimal duration of immunotherapies . The optimal duration of treatment with immunotherapies is unknown . For PD-1 mAbs, some patients are treated indefinitely and others for up to 2 years . It is currently unclear whether long-term responders need ongoing costly infusions of these immunotherapies at the same dosing intervals . Prediction and management of immunotherapy toxicities . Similarly, it would be helpful to know how to use these agents safely in patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, transplant recipients and those with intercurrent infection . Precision immunotherapy . Immuno-oncology has made incredible advances in recent years . In the future, the one size fits all model will become obsolete, and precision immunotherapy will be tailored to each individual to radically improve their outcomes . 
Several classifications of cardiomyopathies have been proposed . O - organs involved . Patients may present with arrhythmia (including sudden cardiac death), syncope or HF . Several other genetic disorders include cardiac hypertrophy as a component . Examples of such disorders include . Fabry disease . Glycogen storage diseases are rare genetic causes of cardiomyopathy . Systolic function is usually preserved at least until the very advanced stage of the disease . Underlying conduction disease also limits treatment choices and requires pacing in some cases . ATTR wild-type disease is a slow progressive cardiomyopathy found mainly in patients over 80 years of age . The disease occurs more often in males and may present with isolated cardiac infiltration and carpal tunnel syndrome . Mayo Clinic staging allows assessment of the severity of cardiac involvement, prognosis and response to treatment in AL disease . Management of cardiac amyloidosis includes supportive therapy for HF and arrhythmia, and treatment of underlying amyloid disease . The disease is progressive in nature and the classic form has its onset in childhood . Cardiac involvement includes LVH, valvular disease with predominant mitral insufficiency, ascending aortic aneurysm formation, CAD and conduction disease . Patients may present with symptoms of HF, arrhythmia or MI . Cardiac sarcoid . Conduction disease is the commonest cardiac presentation; complete heart block is not uncommon . Cardiomyopathy and HF may develop in undiagnosed cases . Conduction disease including sinus node disease may coexist . In up to 15% of cases cardiac involvement may precede the involvement of other organs . Established cardiac disease is rarely responsive to therapy . Therapy includes management of the underlying cause, the treatment of HF, arrhythmia and thromboembolism, and heart transplantation in selected cases . Typical manifestation of this disease includes HF, chest pain or arrhythmias . Treatment of inflammatory cardiomyopathy includes standard HF medications and immunosuppressive therapy in selected cases . Often, the coronary arteries show little or no disease . lack of other causes of cardiomyopathy . no pre-existing heart disease before pregnancy . Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy . Rarely, persistent ventricular tachycardia may present as HF . Athlete's heart . Diabetes mellitus and metabolic cardiomyopathies . It may manifest as cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, congestive HF, valvular heart disease or premature CAD . Cardiac surveillance of cancer therapy should include an annual history and physical examination . Common causes of worsened heart failure . Identification, prevention and early treatment of these form the target for disease management programs . Ischemic heart disease . Ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and HF . The treatment of patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (caused by infection, drugs, alcohol, arrhythmia etc . Optimal BP control is an essential element of therapy in hypertensive heart disease . Valvular heart disease . They often present with a relatively low pressure gradient on echocardiography but with severe symptoms of HF . Acute regurgitation, which presents with acute dyspnea and HF, is a cardiac emergency . Symptoms include progressive dyspnea, angina and symptoms of HF . Mitral valve regurgitation is one of the commonest valvular diseases leading to HF . Chronic regurgitation leads to progressive breathlessness, initially on effort, with the development of symptoms of HF . Secondary mitral valve regurgitation (in patients with cardiomyopathy and CAD) is primarily a disease of the LV myocardium . Mitral valve stenosis causes progressive dyspnea and palpitations . Rare causes of structural tricuspid valve regurgitation include endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and trauma . Symptoms of left-sided heart or pulmonary disease are prominent in most secondary cases . Symptoms include dyspnea and progressive right-sided HF . Symptoms include right-sided HF and arrhythmia . Patient prosthesis mismatch . 
About 15% of PCNSL patients have ocular involvement, and 50-80% of those with isolated ocular lymphoma develop parenchymal brain lymphoma . Systemic lymphoma is an uncommon finding (occurring in 3-5% of PCNSL patients) and the need to perform a comprehensive assessment of the systemic extent of disease is controversial . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the standard neuroimaging technique for the evaluation of PCNSL . Table 10.1 summarizes the approaches to evaluating patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL . Multifocal lesions raise the possibility of metastatic disease, and this may be confounded by the fact that as many as 15% of PCNSL patients have a previous diagnosis of systemic cancer . Surgery is critical for histopathological diagnosis . Corticosteroids may have a potent oncolytic effect in PCNSL, causing tumor cell lysis and radiographic regression in up to 40% of patients . Therefore, steroids should be withheld in any patient with a presumptive diagnosis of PCNSL until histopathological diagnosis is secured . PCNSL is a radiosensitive tumor and whole-brain radiotherapy was the standard treatment for many years . PCNSL is a chemosensitive tumor . High-dose methotrexate is the single most effective agent in the treatment of PCNSL (Figure 10.1) . Most recurrences are seen within 2 years of diagnosis, but late relapses have been reported . Radiotherapy is particularly effective for ocular relapse . Older patients who defer initial radiotherapy remain responsive to this treatment modality, but are at high risk of developing subsequent neurotoxicity . Treatment-related neurotoxicity . A diagnosis of delayed neurotoxicity requires exclusion of recurrent PCNSL by neuroimaging and CSF cytology . Other agents, such as methylphenidate, have been successful in individual patients . Delayed treatment-related cerebrovascular disease has been observed in younger patients 7-10 years after completion of therapy . PCNSL may further predispose to cerebrovascular damage if lysis of angiocentric tumor cells damages neighboring endothelium . HIV-related PCNSL . However, there has since been a significant decline in HIV-related PCNSL . HIV-related PCNSL is associated with infection of B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus . There is a propensity for the lymphoma to develop in the CNS of these patients, presumably because of decreased immune surveillance . Patients with HIV-related PCNSL have a median age of 30-40 years and seizures are a more common presenting feature (encountered in 25% of cases) than in other PCNSL patients . The median latency from the time of diagnosis of HIV infection is approximately 5 years, and the development of PCNSL is often associated with the onset of other HIV-related diseases . Some studies have found a higher incidence of multiple lesions in HIV-related PCNSL; however, multifocal lesions in AIDS patients may have multiple concurrent etiologies . Although patterns of CNS disease in AIDS patients have been changing, toxoplasmosis and PCNSL remain the most common intracranial lesions . Improved therapeutic options and prolonged survival in HIV-positive patients mandate an aggressive approach to achieving a precise diagnosis for an intracranial lesion . The identification of Epstein-Barr viral DNA in the CSF strongly suggests a diagnosis of PCNSL . However, if the diagnosis remains unclear, a diagnostic biopsy should be performed . Treatment is influenced by the clinical assessment of the patient . However, many patients are not able to tolerate this approach . Ocular lymphoma, a variant of PCNSL, is also increasing in incidence . Unlike cerebral PCNSL, diagnosis is often delayed and a misdiagnosis of chronic vitreitis or uveitis is common . The best treatment option for this subset of patients is not known . Patients treated for isolated ocular lymphoma have an 80% risk of developing cerebral involvement as long as 10 years after initial diagnosis . Primary central nervous system lymphoma . Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the central nervous system (CNS) . This tumor is of interest for several reasons . 
The definition of a biosimilar is a regulatory and legal issue, for biosimilars cannot be defined by a single analytic or clinical trial comparison . 'Biosimilar' was the legal name adopted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the first follow-on biologic in 2006, and this same term, along with the five-step regulatory pathway, has been adopted by other national regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . Developing and regulating follow-on biologics to such standards requires a significant level of investment and expertise by pharmaceutical companies and regulators that may not be available in low- and middle-income nations . By definition, such drugs that fail to demonstrate equivalence over all five of the WHO/EMA pathway steps are called 'intended-copy' biologics . Intended-copy biologics in general . 'Intended-copy' biologics have arisen as a means of delivering affordable medicines in markets with less stringent regulatory pathways . Such medicines, while clinically active, may not be close enough to the originator molecule to be judged biosimilar in analytic or clinical testing . Without either a biosimilarity exercise or the security of a large-scale Phase III trial in each indication (for extrapolation cannot be approved in the absence of biosimilarity or a pivotal clinical trial), the safety and efficacy of such medicines cannot be predicted . While intended-copy biologics are unlikely to be encountered in clinical practice in the EU and USA, it should be borne in mind that such products have been misleadingly identified as biosimilars . Examples of clinical problems that have arisen following use of such products are described in the following sections . In the press, these products have been referred to as biosimilars; incidents such as these may fuel concerns with true biosimilars where such concerns are unfounded . Note that intended-copy biologics have also been referred to as 'non-comparable biotherapeutic products', 'biomimics' 'biogenerics' and 'bioquestionables' . This is not to say that intended-copy drugs are bad medicines, just that they are not biosimilars, as understood by the WHO and many regulators . Indeed, the EMA has written that such drugs are not justified scientifically . The point is that intended-copy biologics, when approved, are inherently less predictable for real-world outcomes . While European experience of more than 50 biosimilars approved over more than a decade confirms the utility of the European regulator pathway, there is no such confirmation of the safety and efficacy of intended-copy biologics in regions such as Asia or South America . The following examples illustrate the problems that can arise with intended-copy biologics that have not been through the regulatory scrutiny of biosimilars . Such examples may also have tarnished the reputation of biosimilars and contributed to clinicians' concerns about equivalence, possibly exacerbated by the incorrect use of terminology in both the press and scientific journals . Intended-copy epoetin . Twelve such intended-copy biologics were analyzed in a joint Thai-Dutch study . The extensive use of biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agents led to an epidemic of PRCA in Thailand . Both statements are incorrect, as both original reference drugs and WHO-compliant biosimilar drugs are assessed according to the same standard quality control, including packaging, storage and distribution . Further follow-up pharmacovigilance studies for biologics and biosimilars in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population did not show any differences in adverse event profiles . Intended-copy rituximab . The problem with intended-copy biologics is that they have neither the security of biosimilarity studies nor large volumes of clinical data to predict their safety and efficacy . This level of clinical uncertainty over a WHO essential cancer medicine such as rituximab is unacceptable . There had been expectations that the manufacturer would perform a 1000-patient postauthorization safety and efficacy study of rituximab-Reditux following its launch in 2007 . In this example too, an intended-copy biologic was misrepresented as a biosimilar . Editorials - even in Biosimilar Journal in 2013 - misnamed rituximab-Reditux as a biosimilar . This places an additional burden on physicians and pharmacists in less-regulated regions - they will have to understand the origin and regulatory standards of each potential brand of biologic included in the formularies and stocked by the retail pharmacies that patients might attend . 
Patients with brain tumors typically develop neurological signs and symptoms over a period of weeks to months . Some will have an abrupt onset of signs and symptoms similar to that seen in patients with a cerebrovascular infarct . Initial symptoms are often vague and non-specific (Table 2.1) . The neurological examination may be normal . Hence, a high index of suspicion is necessary so that no clinical clues are disregarded . The various neurological symptoms and signs caused by brain tumors may be generalized, localizing or falsely localizing . Features that should increase suspicion of a tumor include . daily headache on waking that improves over a short interval of time . new headache in a middle-aged or older person . change in pattern, character or severity of a chronic headache . exacerbation of headache by coughing, sneezing, bending, head movement or exertion . headache accompanied by other neurological symptoms . acute headache followed by vomiting . Other generalized signs and symptoms . Poorly described dizziness and tinnitus are common complaints . Papilledema may be an incidental finding on ophthalmologic examination . These events, called plateau waves, are often precipitated by change in position and may be mistaken for a seizure . Localizing and falsely localizing features . Other focal findings depend on the site of the lesion and include hemiparesis, aphasia, visual field loss and sensory disturbance (Table 2.2) . Seizures occur in about one-third of patients; they are often the initial and only symptom . Up to 20% of adults with new-onset seizures will have an underlying brain tumor . Seizures are more common in low-grade than high-grade tumors . Focal seizures are common in situations where the tumor compresses cortex, especially adjacent to the motor strip . Imaging modalities . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the gold standard for the imaging of brain tumors . This imaging technique gives the best anatomic detail of the brain and other intracranial structures . Specific signal characteristics often allow the radiologist to predict the histological diagnosis (Table 2.4) . Perfusion magnetic resonance images give an indication of tumor vascularity and may be a reliable marker of tumor grade . Functional MRI allows areas of brain function to be mapped . This may be useful for presurgical planning to allow maximal resection while sparing critical areas of neurological function . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy may also be useful in assessing the response to newer therapies, particularly targeted molecular strategies that may be cytostatic . CT scanning may also be helpful in determining the extent of bony destruction or hyperostosis related to tumor growth . Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine study that provides metabolic tumor imaging . Uptake is increased in proportion with tumor grade . PET scans are clinically useful in guiding stereotactic needle biopsy (Figure 2.3), or differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor . In the future, they may be important in determining response to newer classes of antitumor drugs such as antiangiogenic agents . Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a less technically demanding nuclear medicine image that is more widely available than PET . Definitive histopathological diagnosis is essential before administering specific antitumor therapy . The only exception is diffuse pontine glioma, as this diagnosis can usually be made on the basis of the characteristic MRI appearance, and the risk of neurological injury subsequent to biopsy outweighs any benefit . A neuropathologist should review all specimens; ideally, an intraoperative frozen section should be obtained and as large a sample as possible submitted for final review . Furthermore, the pathologist should be apprised of . the patient's age and clinical presentation . the radiographic appearance of the tumor . prior therapy, including preoperative interventions such as embolization that may cause focal necrosis . These factors may be critical in the interpretation of pathological findings and guide the selection of appropriate immunohistochemical stains (Table 2.6) or other specialized studies (exempli gratia electron microscopy) . Clinical correlation is critical to the interpretation of both neuroimaging and pathology . Ideally, the clinician should review images and pathology information directly with the radiologist and neuropathologist . 
There are countless articles and books that discuss regulatory considerations associated with medical product development . It is essential to understand that regulatory agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate medical products (like drugs and diagnostic devices) but not the practice of medical care . Structurally, the FDA has six centers, with three most relevant to digital medicine developers . Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) . Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) . Medical devices . Similar to the approval process in the FDA's CDER and CBER, medical devices in the CDRH go through a process for clearance or approval . The CDRH is often the point of contact for digital medicine developers who are building digital medical products such as 'software as a medical device' (SaMD) . The CDRH is responsible for regulating digital 'devices' but not digital tools . As such, we limit our use of the term 'device' in this book to be consistent with the FDA's definition for a 'medical device' (see FDA 2013 and 2017) . For the US market, it is important to distinguish that the FDA does not regulate what the product actually does, but rather what an organization claims the product does . If Product A states that the intended use of this measurement is for a wellness purpose, it likely is not regulated . If Product B says the intended use of this measurement is to make a diagnosis, then it would be considered a 'device' and regulated by the FDA . This means that the exact same product can be developed and marketed either as a 'device' (and thus, regulated) or not a device (and unregulated) simply through a change of words, and no change in hardware or code . A better question would be about the intended use of the product (id est is the organization making a medical device claim?) . The FDA has an open-door policy and encourages organizations to come early and often during product development . Whether the software is a 'device' is ultimately determined by a regulatory body and likely will depend upon the software's intended functions . Class I devices require little safety testing . Class II devices . These types of devices represent around 10% of devices regulated by the CDRH . Devices that perform a similar function to an existing device on the market (a predicate) can be approved simply by demonstrating that they are at least as effective and no more dangerous than the existing device . Historically, the focus of the CDRH relied heavily on the concept of a 'predicate', a legally marketed device (exempli gratia already on the market) with which a new device would claim equivalence . Whether or not a proposed device has a predicate impacts the regulatory pathway the device can use . Defining 'device' . Determining the nature of a digital product is especially challenging because the FDA has other mechanisms like enforcement discretion, where the FDA may determine that the product is a 'device', but chooses not to regulate it . Talking with the appropriate regulatory authority early and often is important during the product development process; it will minimize surprises and develop a forward-thinking regulatory strategy . Put simply, the CDRH is primarily concerned with whether a medical product, including both hardware and software, is safe to use and accurate for measuring what it claims to measure . If the manufacturer of that system does not claim it has a medical use (exempli gratia diagnostic, monitoring), the product will not be regulated by the CDRH . Table 3.2 is a 'cheat sheet' of the primary pathways to market through the CDRH for a software product . Drugs and biologics . Phase I 'first in human' trials test the drugs in healthy human participants . In these trials, the drug is already licensed for use and is being prescribed to patients . Phase IV trials allow sponsors (biopharma and device manufacturers) to see how the product is performing in the 'real world' . The regulatory terms that describe tools, methods, materials or measures that can potentially facilitate the medical product's development are drug development tools (DDTs) or medical device development tools (MDDTs) ('tools' are different from 'devices' at the FDA) . There are also combination products, which contain both a drug and software that meets the definition of a device because of its function . For example, Abilify MyCite is a drug-device combination product comprised of aripiprazole tablets embedded with a software-based ingestible event marker intended to track drug ingestion . 
Some patients will develop complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, portal hypertensive bleeding and/or hepatic encephalopathy . Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis and usually heralds a progressive downhill course . Approximately 50% of patients with ascites from cirrhosis will have died after 2 years . Although this chapter deals with ascites caused by cirrhosis, it should be remembered that cirrhosis is not the only cause of fluid accumulation in the abdomen (Table 8.1) . Most patients with cirrhosis will report developing abdominal distension as ascites develops . The patient should be questioned about history or risk factors for liver disease . are usually present . Most patients have peripheral edema . Blood tests usually document evidence of liver dysfunction . Diagnostic paracentesis is mandatory for all patients with new ascites (Table 8.2) . Treatment of the underlying liver disease is the optimal treatment of ascites (Table 8.3) but, unfortunately, may not be a practical option . All patients with ascites should restrict their dietary sodium intake to less than 2 g per day . Fluid restriction to 1.5 liters is advised but may be more stringent in patients with significant hyponatremia . Diuretics offer relief to many patients . Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is a safe and effective technique for the rapid treatment of ascites . Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) may help patients with ascites refractory to other treatments . Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with refractory ascites, provided they are otherwise good candidates (see Chapter 12) . Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should be suspected in a patient with ascites who is not doing well . Hepatorenal syndrome is a feared complication of cirrhosis, sometimes seen in patients with advanced liver disease and ascites . Portal hypertensive bleeding . Esophagogastric varices are present in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis . Not all patients with varices will bleed, but those who do have a poor prognosis . Despite significant advances in treatment of patients who bleed, mortality remains extraordinarily high . Thus, preventing the first episode of bleeding (primary prevention) is essential for patients at risk . Primary prevention . Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for varices by endoscopy . If varices of significant size are identified, prophylactic treatment should be started (Table 8.4) . The dosages are increased until the patient's heart rate is 50-60 beats per minute . Endoscopic band ligation may benefit patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers . Active bleeding . Variceal bleeding is rarely subtle and should be suspected in any patient with gastrointestinal bleeding and a history or evidence of chronic liver disease . The patient often presents in extremis, hypotensive with hematemesis and melena . Resuscitation is the first step in treatment (Table 8.5) . Prompt endoscopy will enable identification of varices and the opportunity to control active bleeding . EVL usually controls active bleeding with few complications and is therefore the preferred procedure . Like EVL, ES is effective in controlling bleeding . ES is often easier to perform in patients who are actively bleeding, but is associated with more complications than EVL . Both EVL and ES help to prevent further episodes of bleeding . Pharmacological control . Somatostatin and terlipressin control bleeding in approximately 75% of patients, but neither drug is available in the USA . Hepatic encephalopathy . Hepatic encephalopathy encompasses a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with established liver disease in the absence of other metabolic or structural brain abnormalities . in a patient with advanced liver disease . Treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (Table 8.6) should include correction of precipitating factors . Renal and electrolyte abnormalities are common in patients with cirrhosis who are taking diuretics, and should be corrected . Patients who are acutely encephalopathic often benefit from aggressive dosing until they have bowel movements . Tap-water enemas containing lactulose are used for patients unable to take oral lactulose . 
Suprapontine lesions tend to lead to detrusor overactivity, although coordinated sphincter function is preserved . These lesions can therefore result in frequency, urgency and urgency incontinence . The principal causes of suprapontine lesions are dementia, cerebrovascular accident, closed head injury and Parkinson's disease . Suprasacral spinal lesions that interfere with reflex control of the bladder from the higher centers will produce detrusor overactivity . This causes hypertrophy of detrusor smooth muscle (trabeculation) as a result of the frequent, high-pressure, sustained detrusor contractions in the presence of obstruction . Peripheral lesions . The diagnosis of neuropathic bladder disorders requires an understanding of the underlying neurological abnormality, which will be apparent in most patients . However, some patients will present with the symptoms of a neuropathic bladder but with no overt neurological cause . Apart from neurological examination, urodynamic investigation is essential to make an appropriate diagnosis and provide treatment . The aim of treating the neuropathic bladder is to enable low-pressure storage of urine and bladder emptying without obstruction . Control of detrusor overactivity with antimuscarinic drugs or surgery is described in Chapter 4 (see 4 . If oral therapy cannot be tolerated, intravesical agents such as botulinum toxin or oxybutynin may be used . Reducing resistance in the external urethral sphincter can be achieved by a number of methods: sphincterotomy, sphincter stenting or injection of botulinum toxin . These procedures are only suitable for men, who should be counseled about the risk of continuous incontinence afterwards . Sphincter weakness or stress incontinence, which accompanies neurological bladder dysfunction, may be resolved by procedures to enhance the bladder outlet (see 3 . vi and 3 . Many patients catheterize themselves on a regular basis throughout the day (and night) to ensure bladder emptying . If possible, the patient should void prior to catheterization . Examples of catheters used for ISC are shown in Figure 9.2 . Long-term indwelling catheterization (Figure 9.3) is usually a last resort when all other treatments have failed . However, it may occasionally be used for shorter periods (< 30 days) if patients are undecided about their preferred management option . It is also easier to change on a regular basis and causes less discomfort than may be experienced when changing a urethral catheter . If dislodged inadvertently, the tract may close and so rapid replacement is desirable, however . of a suprapubic catheter should be carried out under ultrasound or cystoscopic guidance, as there is a risk of bowel trauma from incorrect placement of the catheter . Mortality associated with insertion has been reported as being up to 2% . Catheter problems . If a suprapubic catheter falls out it is important that it is replaced quickly, ideally immediately . The tract may start to close quickly, and after 2 hours it may be impossible to reinsert the catheter without dilatation of the tract . Some patients are more prone to catheter blockage than others . If blockage occurs on a regular basis, imaging and/or cystoscopy should be performed to look for bladder calculi or other abnormalities . If investigation suggests calculi, cystoscopy should be performed and the stones removed . Catheter changes . In general, most indwelling catheters need to be changed every 4-6 weeks . Follow-up . All patients with spinal cord injury and bladder dysfunction are susceptible to renal damage if the intravesical pressure is not adequately controlled . Yearly follow-up with at least ultrasonography of the upper urinary tracts and measurement of serum creatinine is therefore essential . There is a risk of malignancy with indwelling catheters, especially after lengthy periods of time, although there is no agreement on the magnitude of risk . Many, therefore, feel such patients should undergo yearly cystoscopies and bladder washes for cytology . Neuropathic bladder dysfunction . Most neurological diseases that affect the spinal cord and some that affect the brain will cause bladder dysfunction, which, if untreated, may lead to incontinence . Urodynamic investigation is required to distinguish between the different types of filling/storage and voiding dysfunction that may result . 
However, complications are uncommon, even though many patients with meningiomas are elderly . Meningiomas that are completely resected are associated with recurrence rates of approximately 3% at 5 years and 20% at 20 years . Meningiomas are highly vascular tumors, hence the blood supply must be coagulated before the tumor is removed by internal decompression . Usually, approximately 1 cm of dural attachment is removed with the tumor, as there is no distinct margin separating the meningioma from the dura . If CT or MRI demonstrates an enhancing dural tail, this should be removed with the tumor . Meningiomas that involve the cerebral and cerebellar convexities can usually be completely removed . It is best to remove as much tumor as possible without damaging the sinus . Observation and radiotherapy are the usual ways of dealing with residual tumor surrounding the sinus . Skull base meningiomas are particularly difficult to manage because they usually invade dura and compress vital blood vessels and cranial nerves . Similarly, optic nerve sheath meningiomas cannot be resected without sacrificing vision, and should therefore be treated with stereotactic radiotherapy if they are progressive . Radiotherapy is becoming an increasingly important treatment option for meningiomas after initial subtotal resection or following recurrence . Radiotherapy appears to induce apoptosis in meningioma cells and consequently causes cessation of tumor growth, rather than tumor regression . Despite these concerns, radiotherapy substantially delays time-to-recurrence for patients with meningiomas, with the most encouraging series reporting 10-year progression-free survival rates of 83% in patients who have undergone subtotal resection of benign meningiomas . There are limited therapeutic options for patients with meningiomas that are recurrent or progressive following maximal surgery and radiotherapy . Antiestrogenic and antiprogestational agents have been evaluated as potential treatments because meningiomas often express steroid receptors and the growth kinetics of some of these tumors are influenced by female sex hormones . Most trials have failed to show chemotherapeutic drugs to be effective for benign or malignant meningiomas . Somatostatin may have a role in the management of patients who have enlarging meningiomas that are positive on octreotide imaging, but the foundation of this approach rests on isolated case reports . Malignant meningiomas remain resistant to therapy, although a recent report has suggested a possible role for alpha-interferon in patients with such tumors . Meningiomas are neoplasms that arise from the coverings of the brain and spinal cord, the meninges . The annual incidence of meningiomas is at least 2 per 100000 . They are the most common meningeal tumor and the most frequently encountered intracranial neoplasm . Meningiomas comprise approximately 20% of all brain tumors, and at least 90% are histologically benign or typical . The WHO classification of meningiomas is presented in Table 6.1 . With the exception of the papillary meningioma, which tends to be particularly aggressive, these subtypes are descriptive and without prognostic significance . Atypical meningiomas have frequent mitoses, large nuclei with prominent nucleoli, increased cellularity and necrosis . Meningiomas are most frequently diagnosed in patients aged 50-80 years, and affect women 2-3 times as often as men (Table 6.2) . The diagnosis of meningioma is suggested by the unique radiographic features (Figure 6.1) . Although most meningiomas are histologically benign, they cause considerable morbidity because they are often not completely resectable, or are progressive or recurrent . Because meningiomas are frequently asymptomatic and tend to occur in elderly patients, the decision to treat is often a controversial one . When patients are diagnosed with an asymptomatic meningioma by CT or MRI, a period of observation of up to 1 year is often suggested before a decision is taken to treat the tumor . The decision to delay treatment is based on the indolent and very long natural history of most meningiomas . For patients who have meningiomas that cause persistent neurological deficits, or for patients whose tumors have unusual radiographic features or are causing significant cerebral edema, an immediate intervention is often recommended . 
The neuropathy may or may not be painful, though over 45% of individuals who have had diabetes for 25 years will experience painful DN . Patients report a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mildly disturbing tingling to severe pain that can interfere with sleep and normal activities . The degree of nerve damage does not correlate with pain intensity, and patients can develop insensitive feet without preceding pain or paresthesias . All of the other types of neuropathy can be painful . However, these laboratory tests are not necessary to make the diagnosis of DN and to begin the successful treatment of pain . Metabolic treatment seems to be a promising approach . The effectiveness of TCAs for DN has been confirmed in meta-analyses of RCTs . However, 1 in 3 individuals develops minor side effects and 1 in 17 stops the medication because of the severity of side effects . Side effects . Low starting doses and careful titration may help to minimize these effects . The effectiveness of anticonvulsants has been confirmed in meta-analyses of RCTs . Side effects . Side effects . Troublesome side effects, such as nausea and vomiting and sedation, are common . Systematic reviews of RCTs have revealed that about 80% of patients receiving opioids experience at least one adverse event . The associated pain is usually mild or moderate in intensity, but it may be excruciating . Advancing age is an important risk factor for developing PHN . After acute herpes zoster infection, 2% of patients under 60 years old develop PHN, but this figure progressively increases to about 50% with advancing age . The apparent severity of PHN reported in RCTs is higher, perhaps reflecting a referral bias . Other risk factors are the severity of the acute zoster lesions and the intensity of the acute pain . The duration of PHN is highly variable: at least 30% of all individuals with this type of pain will continue to have severe pain 1 year after the onset of herpes zoster . Patients describe a sharp jabbing burning pain or a deep aching pain, with extreme sensitivity to touch and temperature change . PHN often has three distinct types of pain (Table 6.2) . Prevention of PHN is a key strategy as, once developed, PHN is very difficult to treat . Antiviral treatment . If acute herpes zoster occurs, antiviral treatment should be given as soon as possible to reduce the severity and duration of the acute zoster episode and thus indirectly decrease the risk of PHN (there is no direct effect of antiviral treatment on PHN) . Meta-analyses of RCTs have indicated that aciclovir (acyclovir) reduces the severity and duration of herpes zoster and acute zoster-associated pain . However, as the condition is often well established before treatment is started, antiviral therapy may be of limited effectiveness . Effective pain treatment in the acute phase reduces risk of PHN . Given the risk of side effects, TCAs should be used with caution in older patients; a trial of gabapentin or pregabalin may be preferable . Pharmacological management of established PHN . Overall, pharmacological treatment of PHN tends to be unsatisfactory . However, supportive evidence from RCTs is lacking . Meta-analyses of RCTs show that corticosteroids do not prevent PHN . Tricyclic antidepressants are useful for PHN, as in DN (see pages 95 -) . SSRIs do not seem to be effective . Anticonvulsants can effectively relieve postherpetic pain, as shown by meta-analyses of RCTs . The degree of effect is similar to that reported for DN (see pages 96 -) . Gabapentin, pregabalin and sodium valproate have been reported to be effective in PHN . Capsaicin relieves pain associated with PHN . Discussion on the use of opioids in DN (see pages 97 -) applies equally to use in PHN or other neuropathic chronic pain . A meta-analysis of RCTs of topical lidocaine (lignocaine) patches for PHN reached no firm conclusion regarding effect . Invasive approaches may need to be considered for severe neuropathic pain that does not respond to the usual treatments . Systemic lidocaine infusion may be used to bring a severe exacerbation of pain under control . 
MRI studies are improving our understanding of the pathogenic role of menisci (see pages 26 -) . Meniscal damage and tears, as well as some degree of meniscal extrusion, are very common in established OA . Perimeniscal synovitis is frequent in advanced OA, where complete degeneration or maceration of the meniscus is also common . Functional joint pathology . It is not sufficient to merely describe the pathological features of individual tissues in the OA joint without considering the pathology of the joint as a functional unit, where a complex interplay of periarticular muscles, joint alignment, ligamentous strength and intra-articular pathology occurs . Joint stability . Malalignment of the knee increases load through the medial compartment in the varus knee . Associations with both increased medial bone mineral density and bone-marrow lesions on MRI have been described . Periarticular muscles may become weaker as a consequence of OA pain; conversely, weak periarticular muscles may be a risk factor for the development of OA . Radiographic pathology . Radiography has been the long-established method for evaluating in-vivo pathology in OA . Calcium crystals are commonly seen in joint aspirates from OA joints, and research into joint-replacement tissue suggests that calcification is extremely common in joints with end-stage OA . MRI pathology . MRI studies have helped our understanding of the extent and complexity of OA pathology . MRI enables a three-dimensional evaluation of the joint and allows bone, cartilage and soft tissue to be visualized . Early OA MRI studies focused on assessment of cartilage (since one of the great strengths of MRI above conventional radiographs is the direct detection and quantification of cartilage), but later studies included assessment of multiple intra-articular features . These studies confirmed common abnormalities of most of the tissues in the painful OA joint, demonstrating not only cartilage thinning and loss but also bone-marrow lesions, synovitis, meniscal damage and extrusion, and ligament abnormalities (Figures 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10) . Using MRI, almost 90% of people over 50 with normal weight-bearing knee radiographs are found to have OA joint pathologies . Of course, many abnormalities are not associated with symptoms . The prevalence of most MRI abnormalities increases with age . MRI has also provided novel insights into bone pathology in OA . Bone-marrow lesions have been associated with subsequent progression of joint-space narrowing and cartilage loss in the same joint compartment . The correlation between pain and MRI features is discussed on page 50 . Cartilage metabolism changes dramatically as OA develops . Increased levels of MMP have been demonstrated in OA cartilage compared with normal cartilage, particularly in the upper zones . The relative proportions of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) are also altered in OA cartilage . Other proteases also play a role in cartilage breakdown, directly or indirectly . Subchondral bone . Changes in subchondral bone . Around the bone margins, overgrowths of bone, called osteophytes, develop . Changes in bone vascularity . Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to increased bone and cartilage angiogenesis and vascularity in OA . Changes in blood-flow distribution have been described in subchondral bone, with marrow hypertension and edema . It is also unclear whether atherosclerotic disease contributes to OA initiation or progression, and this risk may differ by anatomic site . MRI changes in bone are described later in this chapter . Synovitis - inflammation of the synovium - occurs with increasing frequency with progressive severity of OA . This synovitis is independently associated with subsequent joint replacement . Researchers have also demonstrated the existence of synovitis in early clinical disease . Causes of synovitis . There may of course be different drivers of synovitis over the lifetime course of OA within a given joint . Histological changes of synovitis in patients with OA are generally different from those seen in patients with RA by a matter of degree . In OA synovitis, the thickness of the lining layer increases, angiogenesis increases, and mononuclear and plasma-cell cellular infiltration occurs . 
Liver disorders . The coagulation changes in patients with liver disease are complex and often arise as a result of several different mechanisms . The bleeding risk is also dependent on the platelet count, which is influenced by the degree of splenomegaly secondary to liver-induced portal hypertension . The coagulation changes depend, in part, on the pathogenesis of the underlying liver disease and its rate of onset . cirrhosis in which there is decreased synthesis of clotting factors . Decreased synthesis of clotting factors . Chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, results in diminished synthesis of clotting factors, especially factor (F)II, FVII, FIX and FX . Patients with chronic liver disease have reduced carboxylase activity, resulting in incomplete carboxylation of the precursor peptides . By the time the level falls below 1 g/L, there is usually severe fulminant disease or end-stage decompensated cirrhosis . Various changes in fibrinolysis are observed in liver disease . Thus, the balance of fibrinolysis varies from patient to patient . FVIII and FV . FV is also synthesized predominantly by the liver; a reduced plasma level is a feature of liver failure . It is sometimes useful to measure FV and FVIII to distinguish the coagulopathy of DIC from that of liver disease . In DIC, levels of both factors are decreased, whereas in liver disease FV is low but FVIII is usually normal or high . In liver disease the platelet count is usually normal or reduced . The liver is a source of thrombopoietin, a protein that stimulates platelet production; decreased concentrations have been reported in patients with liver failure . Mild splenomegaly results in platelet pooling, and a platelet count of 75-125 x 10 /L often accompanies cirrhosis . The count may be further reduced by alcohol intake, which inhibits the production of platelets by megakaryocytes . Stopping alcohol consumption often results in a sharp rise in the platelet count after several days . Coagulation inhibitors . Impaired antithrombin synthesis by the diseased liver leads to a reduced plasma concentration, which may predispose to a consumptive coagulopathy . Disseminated intravascular coagulation . Patients with both advanced liver disease and severe acute hepatitis are at risk of DIC (see Chapter 12) . If it is unclear whether the coagulation changes are due to severe liver disease or DIC, measurement of FV and FVIII may be helpful, as a reduction in FV suggests severe impairment of synthesis and a reduction in FVIII suggests DIC . Treatment of the coagulopathy associated with liver disease needs to address risks of bleeding and thrombosis . However, prolonged PT is not significantly associated with bleeding . Furthermore, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials that support the effectiveness of fresh frozen plasma in limiting bleeding from invasive procedures in patients with cirrhosis . Experience with these agents in patients with liver disease is limited . Dialysis substantially reduces the risk of bleeding and is the mainstay of management to keep the hemorrhagic risk under control . Bleeding in patients with renal failure is often due to angiodysplasia, peptic ulcers, gastritis and other mucosal abnormalities . However, the bleeding is exacerbated by platelet abnormalities . Although the platelet count may be normal or mildly reduced, platelet adhesion and aggregation can be defective . Parathormone is elevated in renal failure and also increases platelet cAMP . Intrinsic platelet defects include decreased ADP and serotonin in the platelet dense granules . Reduced platelet aggregation may be due to depressed platelet production of the potent platelet agonist thromboxane A2 . Anemia contributes to the bleeding risk; there is an inverse relationship between the bleeding time and hematocrit . Clinical features of uremic bleeding . Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis generally reduce the bleeding risk, though they may not be equally effective in all patients . In patients with renal failure, it rapidly shortens the bleeding time and improves hemostasis . Although often effective, the response is unpredictable and this blood product has the risks of allergic reactions and transmission of infection . 
For example, a patient with pre-excitation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) may have palpitations unrelated to conduction over the accessory pathway, such as sinus tachycardia due to anxiety . Further investigation of patients with palpitations depends on the severity of the episode and the frequency of the attacks . Patients at risk of cardiac arrhythmias can often be determined by obtaining a history and physical examination, and by reviewing baseline tests . History taking . Relevant features include any history of previous myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac surgery . In addition, any history to suggest the presence of structural heart disease, including hypertension or diabetes, makes an arrhythmia much more likely to be the cause of symptoms . A family history of sudden death is also relevant . Clinical examination should be performed to look for evidence of structural heart disease, including a cardiac murmur, signs of congestive heart failure as well as hypertension . A 12-lead ECG in an asymptomatic patient may reveal features such as pathological Q waves to indicate a previous MI and thus structural disease, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . More specific markers of arrhythmia risk include pre-excitation, a long QT interval or a Brugada pattern in the precordial leads, or early repolarization abnormalities . Referral for more detailed investigations to exclude structural heart disease may be necessary for some patients, particularly those with ventricular ectopics . Additional investigation may include an echocardiogram (cardiac ultrasound), which will give accurate information about the pumping action of the heart and the structure of the heart and valves . Documenting cardiac arrhythmias . The frequency of symptoms will dictate the best investigation to carry out (Table 5.1) . For example, in a patient who presents with a sustained arrhythmia and is not hemodynamically compromised, a 12-lead ECG is mandatory . However, digital recording of rhythm abnormalities has replaced the traditional ECG in many circumstances, especially when palpitations are infrequent . Types of recorders (continuous vs intermittent) . Table 5.2 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the three main types of recorder . Continuous Holter monitor . This can be attached via a strap worn over the shoulder or, more usually, it is carried on a belt . Electrodes attached to the skin record the electrical activity of the heart (Figure 5.1) . These monitors are often used for 24-hour recording, but can be worn for up to 72 hours if required . External loop recorder . The patient wears a device on the wrist or around the waist . Typically, 1-2 weeks of monitoring is obtained, and several transmissions are relayed to a receiving and analysis site . Implantable loop recorder . Current technology has allowed further miniaturization of these devices such that they can now be effectively 'injected' under the skin under local anesthesia, usually on the left side of the sternum in the mid-upper chest (Figure 5.2) . Smartphone and smartwatch monitoring . Smartphone and smartwatch apps now allow direct recording of the heart rhythm; other devices on the market transmit information via bluetooth technology to a smartphone . There is also the FDA-approved Kardia monitor from AliveCor Inc . which combines a pocket-sized ECG recorder (using two finger-pad electrodes) with a smartphone app (see Useful resources) . Inducing or provoking an arrhythmia . Electrophysiological study . Many patients, particularly those with severe or life-threatening arrhythmias, require provocative procedures to induce the tachycardia . However, the advent of digital recording methods, as well as the importance of left ventricular function in determining therapy, has meant that the EP study is now performed only infrequently to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias . Instead, the EP laboratory has become a site for treating cardiac arrhythmias with catheter ablation procedures or device implantation . The diagnostic EP study is still performed (Figure 5.3), but mainly in association with therapeutic procedures . Treadmill exercise testing . Treadmill exercise testing can be used to evaluate arrhythmias, and is occasionally a useful option, particularly in cases where symptoms occur under exercise conditions . Arrhythmias may occur during the exercise test, but there is often an even greater propensity for arrhythmias to occur during the recovery phase . 
Non-epithelial tumors are rare, accounting for 10-15% of all ovarian malignant neoplasms . The most common types are germ cell tumors (GCTs) and sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) (Table 9.1) . The prognosis of non-epithelial ovarian neoplasms tends to be better than for epithelial cancers, largely because most tend to present at an earlier stage: 60-70% of GCTs and 60-95% of SCSTs are detected at an early stage . They will commonly present at younger ages, compared with the more common epithelial ovarian cancer . Germ cell tumors . Malignant germ cell tumors arising in the ovary (MOGCT) are estimated to affect about 60 women each year in England . They typically occur in older adolescents and young women, but rarely may also occur in the postmenopausal population . In most instances, no predisposing factors are found . In rare cases, these tumors can arise from fully differentiated teratomas or dermoids, which are more common and benign conditions . Since germ cells can differentiate to form all cell types seen in neonates and adults, any combination of pathologies is possible, although some are more common than others . For example, elements of yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma and dysgerminoma are more commonly seen than embryonal or rhabdomyosarcoma . The elements present can help to predict clinical behavior and the production of tumor markers . Tumor markers . Elevation of either or both of these two markers is seen in about 85% of non-dysgerminomatous MOGCT, and hCG is also raised in about 10% of dysgerminomatous cases . In addition, CA125 may be non-specifically raised in any type of MOGCT induced by peritoneal irritation . This is because elevated hCG or AFP is virtually diagnostic of MOGCT, and could lead to fertility-sparing surgery rather than the usual more radical surgery used for primary epithelial cancers . Clinical presentation and investigations . Local and/or systemic impairment and pain can arise in combination with an irregular menstrual cycle . Sex cord-stromal tumors . SCSTs arise from the sex cords and ovarian stroma, and account for 5-8% of ovarian cancers . The diagnosis of an SCST should be suspected in patients with . an adnexal mass on ultrasound . estrogen excess with precocious puberty . abnormal uterine bleeding . endometrial hyperplasia . androgen excess with virilization . Potential biomarkers of SCSTs are shown in Table 9.3 . Granulosa cell tumors are the most common form of SCST, and account for 2-5% of all ovarian malignant neoplasms . Histologically, these tumors are characterized by lobulated cells with signs of luteinization . Adult-type tumors typically present during the perimenopausal or menopausal period . In this subtype, granulosa cells are arranged in small clusters or rosettes around a central cavity (Call-Exner bodies) . The nuclei are often described as coffee bean-like in morphology . Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (see Figure 5.1) with adequate peritoneal staging should be considered as a fertility-preserving option for patients with stage I disease . If the uterus is preserved, an evaluation of the endometrium, for example through dilatation and curettage, should be performed to exclude an estrogen-induced endometrial cancerous or precancerous state . Systematic lymph node dissection or sampling has no value in the absence of bulky nodes . Similarly, there is no value in blind biopsies of a normal contralateral ovary . There are no data to support a survival benefit with postoperative chemotherapy for women with resected disease . However, the BEP regimen (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) is usually recommended for women with advanced disease, although the less toxic carboplatin and paclitaxel combination is increasingly being used . They secrete androgens, hence 75-80% of patients show signs of virilization . Surgery forms the mainstay of treatment of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors . 
Synovial joints mainly comprise . subchondral bone . synovial fluid . Histologically, the cartilage is seen as an upper non-calcified layer divided into the following zones . superficial, with few cells and tangential collagen fibers (zone I) . The only cells in cartilage are chondrocytes . Extracellular matrix . Cartilage tissue is largely composed of an extracellular matrix that is both synthesized and broken down by the chondrocytes . This matrix is very well hydrated, consisting of 70-80% water, protein collagen fibers, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans and some non-collagen proteins . One of the main functions of cartilage is to absorb and dissipate mechanical load . Collagen fibers . The collagen fibers of the extracellular matrix give tensile strength and three-dimensional shape to the cartilage . The fibers are composed of compact, triple-helical collagen molecules (Figure 1.4), which are classified according to length and side chains: collagen type II makes up 80-90% of the articular cartilage collagen . The aggrecan molecules in the extracellular matrix are stabilized by link protein and are attached to hyaluronic acid (HA) molecules, which are also very large glycosaminoglycans . One HA molecule may bind up to 200 aggrecan molecules, forming a macromolecular aggregate (see Figure 1.5) . Aggrecan gives cartilage its elastic properties in circumstances of compressive load . Other non-collagenous proteins . The roles of other, less abundant, non-collagenous proteins in the extracellular matrix, including cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, decorin, lumican and biglycan, are less fully understood . Mechanical loading increases proteoglycan production by chondrocytes . Subchondral bone . Subchondral bone comprises a subchondral plate and underlying trabecular bone . Like cartilage, the thickness of the subchondral bone may vary with location within a joint; it may be thicker in the central weight-bearing areas of joints . Bone composition . The bone matrix is composed primarily of inorganic mineral, with about 25% comprising organic matrix and cells . The cellular elements of bone are . osteoblasts, which are of mesenchymal cell origin and produce collagen and bone matrix . Type I collagen is the major organic component of bone . The type I collagen molecules are cross-linked by molecules such as pyridinoline . Non-collagenous proteins present in the matrix include proteoglycans, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein . Nerve fibers have also been demonstrated in the Haversian canals of the subchondral bone . Normal bone homeostasis . It consists of a continual surface layer of cells (the intimal or lining layer) and underlying tissue (the subintimal layer) . Type B cells are functionally specialized compared with fibroblasts from other sites . The synovial intimal extracellular matrix is composed largely of HA, chondroitin sulfates, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, collagen (types III-VI), fibronectin and laminin . Interactions between synoviocytes and the extracellular matrix play an important role in the maintenance of the intimal lining layer . It comprises blood and lymphatic vessels, and a range of cells . Synovial fluid . Molecules and cells pass in and out of the synovial fluid passage via the synovial intima and its underlying microcirculation . The intimal matrix has a sieve-like role, allowing diffusion of water and other small molecules while preventing the rapid movement of large molecules such as albumin and HA . The synovial fluid is largely composed of an ultrafiltrate of plasma (except for the HA concentration) . Its major non-cellular constituents are HA and proteins of relatively low molecular weight such as albumin and B globulins . Synovial fluid is highly viscous and its volume varies from joint to joint; normal values are not well defined . The synovial intimal cells regulate the volume of synovial fluid, largely by control of HA production . 
Drug-induced parkinsonism . Treatment consists of withdrawal of the offending medication . Anticholinergics may be beneficial; levodopa treatment has not been studied systematically . Progressive supranuclear palsy . The pathological hallmark is tau protein-positive filamentous inclusions, known as neurofibrillary tangles, in the glia and neurons . Limb rest-tremor is rare but has been reported . Usually, patients die within 5-10 years because of increasing bulbar problems and immobility . Multiple system atrophy . Criteria for the diagnosis of MSA were formulated by Quinn in 1989 and 1994 and subsequently by Gilman et al . Urinary symptoms are very common . Dementia with Lewy bodies . Some patients may have associated neurofibrillary tangles consistent with coincidental Alzheimer's disease . Clinical criteria for diagnosis were developed in 1996 and updated in 1999 . Repeated and early falls and neuroleptic sensitivity can be seen . Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration . A jerky useless lower extremity is uncommon, but may occur . Parkinsonism in young adults . Onset of Parkinson's disease at this age is not rare . When symptoms begin before the age of 20, the term juvenile parkinsonism may be used . Dopa-responsive dystonia . Dystonia is the predominant phenotypic expression; autosomal dominance is the usual inheritance . The disorder characteristically shows marked diurnal variation, and may start in childhood with an unusual gait . Some family members may show later-onset parkinsonism . A combination of parkinsonism and ataxia is characteristic of neurological Wilson's disease . The most useful diagnostic test results are a low serum ceruloplasmin level and a raised 24-hour urinary copper excretion . Slit-lamp examination should be performed looking for Kayser-Fleischer rings (see above) . Liver biopsy to show copper deposition remains the gold standard diagnostic test . Hemiparkinsonism hemiatrophy syndrome . Neuroimaging reveals atrophy of the contralateral hemisphere with compensatory ventricular dilatation . MRI shows characteristic atrophy of the caudate nucleus and hyperintensity in the putamen on T2-weighted images . Acanthocytes are revealed on a fresh blood smear . Encephalitis lethargica and postencephalitic parkinsonism . From 1919 to 1926 there were several pandemic outbreaks of encephalitis lethargica (von Economo's encephalitis) . Patients had headache, fever, somnolence and ophthalmoplegia . Sometimes obsessional thoughts or fear and anxiety accompany attacks . Other infectious etiologies . Manganism is a neurological syndrome caused by excessive exposure to high levels of manganese . In general, rest-tremor is absent and the clinical features are symmetric . In addition, response to levodopa is poor or non-existent . More recently, an outbreak of manganism was reported in individuals abusing an illicit drug made with a compound that contained manganese . MPTP causes a pure motor parkinsonian syndrome that responds well to levodopa . Other toxins produce a more complex parkinsonian syndrome unresponsive to levodopa . Structural lesions that either directly or indirectly affect the basal ganglia may produce parkinsonism . These are almost always identified on MRI scans . Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is characterized by the triad of gait difficulty, dementia and urinary incontinence . Poor postural reflexes and flexed posture may also be seen . The hydrocephalus should be treated either by shunting or by shunt revision in the case of malfunction . Normal-pressure hydrocephalus is diagnosed frequently, and many patients undergo shunting without adequate results . A variety of tumor types have been described, including . The disease course may be stable from onset or progressive, or may resolve spontaneously . Often, additional signs such as spasticity or abnormal plantar reflexes are present . Post-traumatic parkinsonism . Miscellaneous causes . Parkinsonism may occur transiently during alcohol withdrawal . 
Without effective intervention, cigarette smoking is expected to have killed some 520 million people worldwide by 2050 . Fortunately, many governments around the world are beginning to wake up to the magnitude of the problem, and are developing tobacco control programs . Unfortunately, the health services in most countries have not been geared up to provide evidence-based support for quitting, even very low-cost clinical programs that could be incorporated into existing clinical services . In countries that do have comprehensive smoking cessation programs, the challenge is in ensuring that smokers make full use of these services . While research on improving treatments for smoking-related disorders continues, smoking cessation remains our best hope for reducing the burden of tobacco-related death and disease over the next 50 years . If higher rates of smoking cessation are to be achieved, concerted action is required on all fronts: fiscal, legislative, educational and clinical . develop clinical interventions that improve on the success rates of existing methods . make greater use of effective treatments so that the proportion of attempts that are successful increases considerably . Improved forms of nicotine-replacement therapy . It seems reasonable to suppose that if a pure nicotine delivery system could be found that was almost as efficient as the cigarette and also as palatable, it would be more effective than the current generation of nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) products in helping smokers to quit . However, it also seems likely that smokers would transfer their dependence to this product . Nevertheless, even if smokers continued to use such a product indefinitely, there would be minimal health risks, so this is an important area for development . Ensuring effective use of nicotine-replacement therapy . There is now evidence that in countries where it has been studied, such as the UK, use of NRT bought over the counter and used without any professional support is not improving smokers' success rates . There is an urgent need to find out why and to take steps to ensure that smokers gain the benefit they expect . It is possible that these smokers are not using enough of the product or not using it for long enough for it to be effective . In that case, cheap scalable interventions to improve adherence to medication instructions could make a substantial difference . To date, no vaccine has been found to be effective in clinical trials but the principle is intriguing and research continues . Increasing use of traditional treatment services . A smoker's chances of stopping successfully without help are less than 5% in any given quit attempt . If that smoker attends a smokers' clinic and receives behavioral support and medication, the chance rises to 20% . However, at present only about 3% of smokers take advantage of these clinics in the UK each year, even though they are provided free of charge . Similarly, use of telephone counseling services in the USA is very low . Raising it to 10% would have an important effect on public health . The challenge is to find ways to increase uptake . Some studies have shown increased uptake when the clinician directly connects the patient to treatment services (exempli gratia arranging for a quitline counselor to call) . Novel channels for delivery of treatment services . So far, smoking cessation services have been delivered via traditional clinical channels, often modeled on mental health services, such as one-to-one meetings with a counselor, or group meetings with other smokers . Many smokers find these forms of treatment unappealing, and their availability is often limited . Studies are beginning to demonstrate the efficacy of treatment delivered through other channels, for example by means of telephone helplines, computer-tailored materials, the internet and smartphone apps . Telephone helplines have proven to be effective, when provided by a trained counselor following evidence-based protocols . Telephone counseling that depends on smokers' initiative to call for help ('hotlines') is under-used and not as effective as counseling programs that schedule regular calls, paralleling the structure of face-to-face counseling . A systematic review of randomized controlled trials has concluded that internet-based interventions can aid cessation but many do not and it is not clear what features make an effective internet support program . A very large randomized trial in the UK found that an open-source internet intervention called StopAdvisor increased quit rates in blue-collar smokers (smokers in manual jobs) but not white-collar smokers (professionals) . It had been specifically developed to appeal to the former group . Although more than 200 stop-smoking apps are available, very few have data on their effectiveness . Most of them are unlikely to be effective given that they do not use evidence-based behavior change techniques . 
The incidence of PTCL in the USA is less than 1 per 100 000 according to the latest Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry . Here, 'T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoid neoplasms' accounted for 6% of all lymphoid neoplasms (B-cell lymphoid neoplasms accounted for 80% and Hodgkin lymphoma for 7%) . During 1997-2006, the incidence of T/NK-cell lymphoid neoplasms in the SEER registry was tenfold lower than that of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms (2.09 vs 27.96 per 100 000) . The incidence was highest for PTCL (0.78), followed by mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (0.54) and T/NK-cell lymphoid neoplasms not otherwise specified (NOS) (0.49) . Rates of T/NK-cell lymphoid neoplasms rose by 1.17% annually, and higher rates were seen in black men (2.2%) and Asian women (2.3%) . The rate of PTCL increased by 3.78% over this time, with markedly greater increases in AITL (14%) and PTCL-NOS (5.5%) . There was a decrease in the incidence of ALCL (2.0%) but this, and the concomitant increase in AITL, may have been related to changes in coding . The incidence of the different subtypes of PTCL in the SEER registry is shown in Table 3.1 . The overall frequency of the different subtypes of PTCL from the International PTCL project are shown in Table 3.2, based on retrospective analysis of 1314 cases of previously untreated PTCL or ENKTCL diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 at 22 centers worldwide . PTCL affects twice as many men as women . Ethnic differences . For example, the frequency of AITL is higher among Asian men than black or white men . A study of 13 107 cases of PTCL in SEER registries between 2000 and 2012 reported that the annual incidence was highest in black people and lowest in Native Americans . Differences in the distribution of the different subtypes were also reported (all p < 0.05) . The incidence of PTCL-NOS, ALCL and ATLL was higher in black than in non-Hispanic white people, whereas the incidence of AITL was lower . Asians/Pacific Islanders had a higher incidence of AITL, ATLL, nasal-type ENKTCL and NK-cell leukemia, and a lower incidence of ALCL . Hispanic people had a higher incidence of AITL and ENKTCL . Native Americans had a lower incidence of PTCL-NOS . The frequency of the most common subtypes of PTCL varies geographically . In Europe, the nodal subtypes account for more than 80% of PTCL cases in Caucasian patients (PTCL-NOS 34%; AITL 28%; ALK + ALCL 6%; ALK - ALCL 9%) . PTCL-NOS is more common in North America but less common in Europe and East Asia . AITL is more common in Europe than in Asia or North America . For ALCL, the ALK + form is more common in North America whereas the ALK - form is more common in Europe . EATL is more common in areas with a high incidence of celiac disease - it accounts for 5.8% and 9.1% of PTCLs in North America and Europe, respectively, but only 1.9% in Asia . As noted above, the increasing incidence of ENKTCL in East Asia is partly due to endemic HTLV-1 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections . Although ENKTCL is substantially more common in East Asian and South American territories, this cannot be explained by differences in EBV seroprevalence - EBV is endemic, infecting 95% of adults globally . Demographic and biological data support the early involvement of EBV in the initiation and potentiation of ENKTCL . EBV may also contribute to the transformation of Tfh cells in AITL . EBV has also been detected in most AITL biopsies, although the majority of the EBV-harboring cells are polyclonal B cells; the malignant T cells are EBV-negative . 
Family studies and twin studies indicate that there is a genetic susceptibility to RA, which is higher in families with more severe disease . Unlike classic Mendelian diseases such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease, RA is a polygenic and genetically heterogeneous disease . Thus, a number of different genes predispose to RA, and these may differ from patient to patient (Figure 2.1) . Additionally, some genes may influence severity rather than occurrence of RA . Until recently, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was the only genetic region that had been consistently linked to RA . The strongest genetic link to RA is the class II HLA region and, in particular, HLA-DRB1 . The shared epitope influences both the incidence and the severity of RA, and individuals who inherit two shared epitope-encoding HLA-DRB1 alleles suffer particularly aggressive disease . There are other potential explanations for this genetic association, however . In this context, non-inherited maternal HLA molecules may also influence RA susceptibility . The shared epitope itself could also become an autoantigen . Non-MHC genes . Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized our understanding of complex diseases such as RA . SNPs that appear more commonly in individuals with the disease in question should lie within or close to genes that are associated with the disease . The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium published the first GWAS of RA and, with subsequent studies, has identified and confirmed a number of genes associated with the disease . Consequently, many minor genetic influences await identification, including more recent concepts such as gene copy number variants . A seminal study has irrefutably linked smoking to the etiology of RA in patients carrying a predisposing genotype . If the individual smokes, the OR increases to approximately 23 times . PTPN22 also contributes to RA risk in this model, which clearly demonstrates the influence of smoking on RA development (Figure 2.3) . Other airborne exposures, for example to silica dust and coal dust, have also been associated with the development of RA . The shared epitope and PTPN22 appear to be associated only with ACPA-positive RA, and seronegative disease appears to have a distinct, and much less well defined, etiology . 'Pre-RA' . Whether all individuals who develop autoantibodies will ultimately develop RA is currently uncertain, but there may be important additional environmental triggers for disease onset . Infectious triggers . Infectious agents can be associated with arthritic illness in both humans and in animals . Despite these examples, no consistent association has been found between RA and any infectious agent, and the disease does not occur in clusters or demonstrate seasonal variation . Furthermore, RA generally improves during pregnancy and may flare in the puerperium . Many patients report that certain foods seem to trigger episodes of arthritis . These would only provide positive results, however, if patients shared a common dietary trigger whereas individuals generally identify different triggers . Starvation improves RA symptoms, and a few studies have incriminated a high-protein diet as an arthritogenic trigger . Obesity is also associated with RA in a few epidemiological studies, as is caffeine consumption . Recently, alcohol consumption has been reported to protect against RA development . In brief, a susceptible individual inherits a collection of predisposing alleles, which might include a shared-epitope-encoding HLA-DRB1 allele and an RA-associated PTPN22 allele . It is notable that many of the genes associated with seropositive RA encode proteins that affect immune cell function and are also associated with other autoimmune diseases . For example, both PTPN22 and CTLA-4 influence T cell activation, and are also associated with type 1 diabetes . It now appears that smoking triggers the formation of ACPA in genetically predisposed individuals, and that this occurs some years before disease onset . Subsequently, a further environmental event may trigger subclinical inflammation, eventually culminating in clinical disease . This suggests that random, or stochastic, events are also required for disease expression . As with many common diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents a balance between nature and nurture, in which environmental factors act upon a genetically predisposed host . In the past few years great advances have been made in dissecting the gene-environment interactions that predispose to RA . 
Management of schizophrenia can be divided into the phases of the disorder . Evidence-based interventions take the form of drug treatments, psychosocial treatments and service level interventions . Multidisciplinary teams are the core of community-based services for people with schizophrenia (Table 9.1) . These are effective when a case management model is used, so that one care coordinator develops and oversees the patient's entire care package . Different models of care management exist, but systematic reviews have shown that it is most effective when combined with assertive community treatment . Getting people with schizophrenia back to work is also important . Meanwhile, specialist rehabilitation services can reduce the enduring deficits of chronic schizophrenia and improve day-to-day social functioning . Prodromal psychosis . The aim of treatment at this stage is to reduce subpsychotic symptoms and associated distress and to prevent progression to full psychosis . If available, cognitive therapy should be offered; otherwise, supportive counseling and monthly follow-up . First-episode psychosis . A first episode of psychosis requires urgent referral to a specialist mental health team or an early intervention team for assessment within 2 weeks . Full diagnostic assessment should include a physical and neurological examination, an assessment of physical health (Table 9.2) and evaluation of substance abuse status . The next step is to communicate the diagnosis and treatment plan effectively to the patient and family where appropriate, including what the diagnosis means and why it has been made . In addition, psychological support and treatment should be initiated, ideally cognitive therapy for 16 weeks in addition to drug treatment . Side effects and weight should be monitored weekly for the first 6 weeks . Improving adherence to pharmacological treatment . Poor adherence to drug treatment is not unique to schizophrenia (Table 9.3) . Shared decision-making between the person with schizophrenia and healthcare professional, taking into account the views of the carer where appropriate, is the cornerstone of management in schizophrenia and essential to improving outcomes . The clinician must provide quality information on both the benefits and adverse effects of each recommended treatment, and the expected time to response, so that patients and carers can make informed decisions . It is particularly important to discuss the side effects that the person is and is not willing to tolerate in order to minimize non-adherence to treatment . Self-management is also important (Table 9.4) . This is a growing area of activity, especially around the potential of web- and smartphone-based monitoring and interventions to help people with schizophrenia to better manage their own illness (exempli gratia www . com) (Table 9.5) . Remote, ambulant, symptom monitoring with wireless real-time data uploads to a central server, enabling better collaborative management in the form of early intervention and personalized management . Relapse prevention . One mainstay of relapse prevention in schizophrenia is maintenance drug treatment (see page 90), which is known to reduce relapse rates by three to five times if adherence is good . Relapse risk can be reduced further by 50% with added cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) if early signs of relapse, such as racing thoughts or suspiciousness, appear (see Case history 11.1, page 104) . Early warning signs of relapse usually comprise a mixture of 'dysphoric' symptoms, such as anxious mood, followed by mild-to-moderate exacerbations of psychotic symptoms over a period of 1-14 days, with insight usually retained until the day of relapse . Individuals tend to have a distinctive pattern of early warning signs, known as their 'relapse signature' . In terms of the potential for practical management, controlled studies have shown that monitoring of early warning signs every 1-2 weeks, linked to multicomponent intervention, reduces rates of relapse by about half compared with standard care, id est from about 30% per year to 15% . To prevent full relapse, interventions may be offered such as increasing medication dose, changing drug delivery mode, psychological interventions and psychosocial support . Support for carers . Often, carers of people with schizophrenia require assessment of their own needs . A care plan should be developed to address their needs . Carers should be given written and verbal information in an accessible format about . the diagnosis and management of schizophrenia . types of support for carers . roles of teams and services . Treatment resistance . About 30% of people will not respond adequately to two adequate trials of drug treatment of different classes . Clozapine should be the next step in drug treatment . 
Bradyarrhythmia is the main reason for pacemaker implantation . Although it can occur at any age, incidence increases exponentially with age . There are two types of second-degree block . Complete heart block may be congenital or acquired . Prospective studies suggest early pacing offers a survival advantage . Prophylactic pacing is recommended . Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a recognized cause of syncope and falls . Often both are present . Atrial fibrillation . In many patients such drug treatment cannot be withdrawn . Heart failure . Traditionally, pacemakers were implanted exclusively for bradycardias . However, certain types of heart failure without bradycardia have now become an indication . broad QRS complexes > 120 ms . There is no convincing test that predicts who will benefit . Non-responders to cardiac resynchronization therapy . In addition, serious doubt has been cast on its reproducibility . The pacing leads are positioned in the heart using radiographic imaging . Some centers perform implantation as a day-case procedure . An ECG is performed to document proper capture and morphology of the QRS complex . Patients are encouraged to keep the left shoulder mobile to a degree . Fear of activity can lead to frozen shoulder . Short-term problems . Hemothorax is rare, as is death . Long-term problems . Late infection is a rare but serious complication . Product recalls . Single- and dual-chamber devices . Demand-pacing . Cardiac sensors . Although they were life-saving, these early systems created increased morbidity . Frequent complaints were shortness of breath or exercise-induced tiredness . Two or three types are used as standard . Battery life . Battery replacement is a day-case procedure . Optimal pacing mode . Optimal lead position . It is not currently known which the best site is . External interference . Any sensing circuit will be overwhelmed if the external noise is sufficient . Security systems in airports and department stores are safe . Effect on quality of life . It is advisable to avoid driving for a week anyway . Pacemaker implantation precludes the piloting of commercial aircraft . Any limitations relate to the underlying cardiac disorder . This temporarily turns off the sensing circuits and allows the pacemaker to pace continuously . The magnet can be applied during the course of the surgery . MRI scanning . A recent development is MRI-safe pacemakers . Daily activities . Pacemakers confer very few restrictions on daily activity . Normal sexual function and exercise is allowed and depends purely on the underlying cardiac abnormality . Strenuous exertion such as swimming is best avoided for 1 month . Wearers may use microwave ovens but should not stand too close . Implantable cardioverter defibrillators . Primary prevention . It is a life-saving device . Heart failure . Implantation is associated with mortality of approximately 0.1% . Biphasic shocks are more effective than monophasic shocks . ICD function . Mode of action . However, if there is any doubt, a shock is given . Pace termination of VTs . In many cases, VT responds to termination by pacing in the ventricle . Overdrive pacing is effective, painless and quick, and is associated with low battery drain . ICD developments . Effect on quality of life . Psychological issues . The implantation of an ICD is a major decision . Removal of pacemakers and defibrillators . Lead extraction is a challenge and carries a small but significant risk . The overall mortality associated with percutaneous lead extraction is 1-3% . Device failures and recalls . Remote monitoring . Currently, interrogation is unidirectional . Due to safety concerns devices cannot be reprogrammed at a distance . Future trends . Developing technologies are extending the indications for pacemaker implantation . Leadless pacemakers are being developed . 
The most common symptoms of advanced intrathoracic disease are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, bronchial obstruction and dysphagia . These symptoms usually trigger a chest X-ray (CXR) . Some lung cancers are identified by an abnormality found on imaging that is carried out for reasons other than chest symptoms (exempli gratia for employment reasons or before elective surgery) . Initial evaluation of a patient after imaging should involve tissue biopsy by bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, or guided ultrasonography or CT . This plan must then be considered in terms of the patient's comorbidities (cardiac and respiratory function) and individual wishes . Every patient with suspected lung cancer should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, which, together with laboratory testing can assess comorbid conditions and the likelihood of metastases . CT, and in some cases positron emission tomography (PET), provides a non-invasive assessment of tumor size (T), mediastinal node enlargement (N) and potential metastases (M) (see Staging, Chapter 3) . Small biopsies and cytology specimens . About 70% of patients present with advanced stage lung cancer . Diagnosis is usually made from small biopsy and cytology specimens . Historically, pathologists only needed to distinguish between small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but in recent years therapeutic and genetic advances have driven the need for larger quantities of tissue for histological subclassification, immunohistochemistry and molecular and immune pathology . The 2015 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart includes a new classification for small biopsies and cytology similar to that proposed in the 2011 Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification . Well-differentiated tumors with adenocarcinoma morphology (acinar, papillary, lepidic, micropapillary) or squamous cell carcinoma (unequivocal keratinization and well-formed classical bridges) on routine light microscopy can be diagnosed as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, without immunohistochemistry . Poorly differentiated tumors should undergo limited immuno-histochemistry . A single adenocarcinoma marker (exempli gratia thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF1] or Napsin-A) or squamous cell carcinoma marker (exempli gratia p40, cytokeratin 5/6 or p63) can be used to classify most tumors . Carcinomas lacking clear differentiation by morphology and immunohistochemistry are classified as 'NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS)' . NOS carcinomas that stain with adenocarcinoma markers are classified as 'NSCLC, favor adenocarcinoma'; tumors that stain with squamous markers are classified as 'NSCLC, favor squamous cell carcinoma' . In this way, a diagnosis of NSCLC-NOS can be avoided in up to 90% of cases . Molecular testing for tumor gene (somatic) mutations . The discovery of specific gene mutations in NSCLC (Table 2.1) has led to the development of targeted therapies . In particular, the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, found primarily in adenocarcinomas, is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Furthermore, adenocarcinomas with ALK - MET rearrangements are responsive to crizotinib, and patients with adenocarcinoma or NSCLC-NOS are more responsive to pemetrexed than are those with squamous cell carcinoma . In the initial randomized phase 2 study of bevacizumab and chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, bevacizumab was associated with life-threatening hemorrhage in patients with squamous cell carcinoma; therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with this NSCLC histology . 
Identifiable radiographic abnormalities are found in almost all individuals over 50 years old . In geriatric patients, there are often many more abnormalities than necessary to explain the acute, subacute or chronic painful disorder . This has been confirmed in several studies comparing a baseline MRI taken for a symptomatic disc derangement with a follow-up MRI . In a young and otherwise healthy patient who develops acute low back pain after bending and lifting or during vigorous sport activities, radiography or other radiological assessment serves only to reassure the anxious patient or family, and possibly establish a baseline for future comparisons . A plain roentgenogram has little likelihood of discovering a significant abnormality . A concern for low back pain associated with osteoporotic-associated lower lumbar fracture (L3-L5) is a possible neoplasm, either benign or malignant . Vertebral tumors can be confused with atraumatic or traumatic osteoporotic fractures (Figure 2.1), but are most likely in patients with night pain or in those whose pain is not relieved by rest . These sacroiliac lesions may be identified earlier, however, and monitored more easily during observation by MRI evaluation . MRI is more sensitive than either radiography or CT in identifying abnormalities in patients with low back pain, and does not carry the risk of X-ray exposure, but it is more expensive and more likely to provide worrisome detail rather than useful information . In general, many MRI investigations requested are unnecessary . If not, a decision regarding an MRI can be postponed . However, mass effects on the thecal sac indicative of epidural fibrosis have been observed in more than 50% of patients tested in the immediate postoperative period . The enhancement may persist for a year or more in successfully operated patients without any demonstrable, associated symptoms . Descriptions of disc abnormalities are very important in patients with low back pain, but the nomenclature used to describe disc modifications is not standardized . Annular fissures are a possible marker of clinically significant disc pathology . However, a finding of an abnormal disc bulge may be coincidental and is not indicative of pathology . Other radiological investigations . CT also can assess soft tissues including fat, nerve roots, ligaments and discs . The presence of these areas is not indicative of a specific diagnosis, but is very sensitive in identifying spinal fractures . Interventional radiology represents a new frontier in radiology . In a geriatric population and for patients with chronic pain, the specificity is only about 20% . The ability of patients to localize a specific disc derangement by pain-provoking stimulations during discography, and to relate the provoked pain to their symptoms, is also unreliable . Electrodiagnostic studies . When clinical testing for neurological defects is normal or equivocal, or when the radiological findings present too few or too many abnormalities to identify specifically the source of the neural abnormality, electrodiagnostic testing may add greater specificity . Although electrodiagnostic testing can confirm the presence of a nerve root lesion, it cannot indicate the precise level of the nerve root compression . Nonetheless, the precision of EMG in one study of patients with clinical and radiographic (CT) findings of nerve root compression was as low as 20% when the EMG was correlated with surgical findings . Indications for electrodiagnostic studies . any of the above manifestations are present, but are not readily explained by the physical or radiological findings . the patient cannot cooperate in the examination because of psychological or pharmacological (medication, sedation) problems . Laboratory testing . For the most part, with the exception of patients with 'red flags' (see Table 1.1), laboratory testing for patients with low back pain disorders is of little value . Laboratory tests are indicated when a malignancy or infection is suspected . Blood tests are also indicated to identify the potential causes of vertebral osteoporotic fractures . It is relatively easy to think of radiological or laboratory tests that could be performed after an initial history and physical examination has been completed . However, it is important to decide which, if any, of these tests will increase understanding of the patient's problem or result in a specific modification of therapy . As the specific pain generator of many low back pain disorders cannot be precisely characterized, the diagnostic limitations of modern, expensive technology must be acknowledged . All these factors need to be considered as you evaluate patients with low back pain, beyond the information gathered during the office examination . electrodiagnostic studies . 
Treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) involves repeated cycles of myelotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in prolonged cytopenia that requires intensive supportive care . Despite significant advances in supportive care over the last few decades, the treatment of AML is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly related to infection . In addition, proven (and suspected) invasive fungal infections occur in 14-28% of patients following induction chemotherapy, , and are associated with early mortality . Strategies to improve outcomes, especially during induction therapy, include the following . mandatory hospitalization during chemotherapy . use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) after chemotherapy . prophylactic antifungals . Mandatory hospitalization . During initial induction therapy, it is common practice to admit patients, typically for 3-4 weeks, until neutrophil levels recover, although data to support this approach are limited . In a pediatric population, a retrospective study by the Children's Oncology Group found no evidence that mandatory hospitalization reduced either systemic infections or treatment-related mortality . Similar studies in adults have not been reported, but until more data become available, it seems reasonable to admit patients for at least the first 3-4 weeks of induction chemotherapy, unless easily accessible 24-hour supportive care is available . Limited data suggest that using a high-efficiency particulate-air-filtered facility is beneficial, and although this cannot be considered a standard recommendation, some indirect evidence suggests that this could reduce the rate of fungal infection . Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after chemotherapy . Numerous studies, including meta-analyses, have consistently shown that the administration of G-CSF after completion of chemotherapy reduces the duration of neutropenia (typically 2-3 weeks) by 2-5 days . Based on current data, G-CSF is not recommended for all patients; however, its use can be considered in order to accelerate neutrophil recovery in patients with active or persistent infection, and those who are hemodynamically unstable secondary to infection . Prophylactic use of quinolone antibiotics has been shown to reduce infection and mortality rates after chemotherapy . Based on the available evidence, antibiotic prophylaxis after chemotherapy can be considered as standard care, and is a component of most international recommendations . While quinolones are recommended on the basis of the available data, it is reasonable to review the treatment center's antibiogram to inform the choice of antibiotic . Prophylactic antifungal therapy . The overall consensus, based on the available data, is that antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole following chemotherapy is beneficial, Micafungin is an alternative if azoles are contraindicated . Leukapheresis, hydroxyurea and low-dose cytosine have all been suggested as treatment for hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell [WBC] count >= 100 000/mm at presentation), although recent data suggest that none of these interventions reduce early treatment-related mortality in high-risk patients . For younger patients, the current recommendation is to start standard 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy (see page 34), as soon as possible after diagnosis . Among patients with AML, a WBC count at presentation of >=100 000/mm is considered high risk for developing TLS and hyperurcemia, and rasburicase should be considered for prophylaxis . Although not part of any standard recommendation, good central venous access is considered essential for the administration of intensive chemotherapy and for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) . The Hickman catheter is commonly preferred for alloSCT, while a peripherally inserted central venous catheter can also be considered for intensive chemotherapy . Although there are data suggesting that even with chemotherapy, the Hickman catheter is superior; this cannot be considered a standard recommendation based on these limited data . The agreed threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion based on multiple studies is <= 10 000/mm . Hemoglobin levels should be maintained above 80 g/L following chemotherapy, although lower thresholds for red blood cell transfusions may reduce transfusion exposure without deleterious effects . There is no evidence to support routine use of granulocyte infusion to reduce treatment-related infection and mortality . Good personal hygiene is important, and particular attention should be paid to dental and perianal care during the post-chemotherapy neutropenic state . 
Determining the best term boils down to what you are measuring and for what purpose . BEST defines an outcome as any 'measurable characteristic … that is influenced or affected by an individual's baseline state or an intervention as in a clinical trial or other exposure . Clinical outcome or biomarker? . Outcomes are essential measures to determine whether the practice of medicine is working . Outcomes can be clinical outcomes or biomarkers (Box 7.1) . A clinical outcome 'describes or reflects how an individual feels, functions or survives' . For example, 'average gait speed' for walking bouts greater than a certain number of steps measured over multiple days outside the clinic may be a direct measure of mobility, which is one component of physical functioning . A biomarker is 'a defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions' . For example, a biomarker could be measuring hemoglobin A1c in people with diabetes to determine an individual's average blood sugar level over the past several months . For biomarkers, think 'signs', not 'symptoms', which are more likely a clinical outcome . Most of the time, biomarker measures are not the things that are necessarily meaningful to patients - but the measurements might be accurate representations, predictors or monitors of underlying biology and disease . In many circumstances, meaningful clinical outcomes such as survival or the occurrence of a cardiovascular event may occur so infrequently that they are difficult or unethical to study directly . Biomarkers provide researchers with interim evidence about the safety and efficacy of interventions while more definitive clinical data are collected . In some cases, it may be preferable to use established biomarkers as surrogate endpoints to reduce the risk of harm to patients . Though biomarkers have intrinsic characteristics, they also have contextual ones . Although traditionally most biomarkers fall into the modalities of molecular, fluid or imaging categories, more digital biomarkers are being developed . A digital biomarker could be any of the seven BEST biomarker types (see Figure 7.1) . Clinical outcome assessments . Clinical outcome assessments (COAs) are the instruments used to measure clinical outcomes, and include the instructions to participants, scoring models and protocols for administration (Figure 7.2) . The possibility of a fifth COA to describe digital clinical outcome assessments, and specifically those measurements made using technology, was proposed during a summer 2018 Public Workshop at the FDA, though no firm next step was defined . Making human assessments digital . eCOAs have unique properties that offer new ways to measure outcomes . What matters is whether the concept being measured is directly meaningful to patients . Take, for example, multiple sclerosis (MS) . 'Ability to go about my daily activities' is a meaningful aspect of health to MS patients . A PRO (or even an ePRO) could measure a person's ability to perform activities of daily living through a self-reported survey . Self-reported measures require the person to reflect on and assess their own ability, leading to data that are meaningful to that individual, but potentially fraught with person-to-person variability, and subject to recall bias . A PerfO (performance outcome) might measure the amount of time it takes a person to walk 25 m . This is easy to measure and may be correlated with the capacity to perform typical daily activities . This approach has the benefit of not relying on patient recall, but it is an imperfect measure of the real outcome of interest - the ability to perform daily living tasks in a natural environment . Composite measures . We can also combine multimodal data from sensors, questionnaires and other clinical data (exempli gratia lab test, genomic tests) to create composite measures or 'complex biomarkers' . A composite measure consists of several individual measures that are combined to reach a single interpretive readout . For example, you could use sensor, keyboard, voice and speech data from a smartphone to construct a composite measure for cognition, and augment that measure over time with genetic data to make it more multimodal . This could include a patient entering information into an electronic sleep diary or performing a task like a cognitive test . Hybrids of these two measures that use multimodal assessments and combine active and passive measures will also be valuable . An example is using actigraphy to passively measure when an individual fell asleep, coupled with an ePRO asking the individual to self-report the time .

It is estimated that 80-100% of patients receiving chemotherapy without antiemetic prophylaxis will experience some level of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) . The sensation of nausea and the act of vomiting are protective reflexes that rid the intestine and stomach of toxic substances . The experience of nausea is subjective . It is a difficult-to-describe sick or queasy sensation, usually perceived as being in the stomach . Nausea and vomiting are not necessarily on a continuum . Although nausea may be considered a prodromal phase to the act of vomiting, patients may experience significant nausea without vomiting . Conversely, patients may have sudden emesis without nausea . Nausea has been assumed to be the conscious awareness of unusual sensations in the 'vomiting center' of the brainstem (see below), but the existence of such a center and its relationship to nausea remain controversial . Vomiting consists of a pre-ejection phase called retching, and ejection, and is accompanied by shivering and salivation . The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting are not well defined . Vomiting is a reflex activated by toxic substances such as chemotherapy drugs, which may directly affect areas in the cerebral cortex and the medulla oblongata, or may stimulate the small intestine via the vagus nerve . Afferent impulses, triggered from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), pharynx and vagal afferent fibers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, then travel to the vomiting center (VC) - termed the 'central pattern generator' by some authors - in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla (Figure 1.1) . The VC is the primary structure that coordinates the mechanisms of nausea and vomiting; it is sensitive to several neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, substance P), which are released through these pathways . Each individual may require a different level of stimulation to the VC to reach the threshold for nausea or vomiting, such that individuals will experience different responses to the same stimuli . The mechanism that is best supported by research involves an effect on the upper small intestine . When rapidly dividing enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract are damaged, serotonin is released and binds to vagal afferent receptors in the wall of the bowel that activate the VC and stimulate emesis either directly or indirectly through the CTZ . The CTZ is situated in the area postrema of the medulla near the fourth ventricle . It is strongly suspected that the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) neurons, which lie ventrally to the area postrema, initiate emesis . This medullary area is a convergence point for projections arising from the area postrema and the vestibular and vagal afferent . The NTS is a good candidate for the site of action of centrally acting antiemetics . Activation of the VC produces efferent impulses that travel from the VC to the abdominal muscles, salivation center, cranial nerves and respiratory center, causing vomiting . Nausea is thought to be mediated by the autonomic nervous system . Control of CINV . The main approach to the control of emesis has been to identify the active neurotransmitters (Figure 1.2) and their receptors in the CNS and the GI tract that mediate the afferent inputs to the VC . The receptors associated with serotonin and substance P are 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT) and neurokinin-1 (NK-1), respectively . The study of these serotonin and substance P receptors has guided the development of antagonists, with relative success in controlling emesis (Table 1.1) (also see Chapter 3) . Despite some reduction of nausea after treatment with 5HT and NK-1 receptor antagonists (RAs), it remains a problem, suggesting other pathways may be important in controlling nausea . Dopamine RAs have been shown to have some efficacy in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy . They have not been effective in the prevention of CINV . Agents that may affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), histaminic and muscarinic receptors are also being investigated with a view to developing additional effective antiemetic drugs . Dopaminergic, histaminic and muscarinic receptors may be some of the receptors involved in the control of nausea . 
Responses have also been achieved in patients with brain metastases . Lung cancer . Response rates are higher in patients whose tumors have higher expression of PD-L1, although responses also occur in patients with low or no expression . As in melanoma, responses have been seen in patients with brain metastases . Checkpoint inhibitors have not proved effective in patients with pancreatic cancer or microsatellite stable colorectal cancers . Head and neck cancer . Activity has also been demonstrated with other agents . Other cancers . Toxicities from checkpoint inhibitors . Severe toxicities can lead to interruption and/or cessation of therapy, substantial morbidity and occasional mortality . At present, there are no effective predictors of toxicities . Nevertheless, a number of general statements can be made regarding the toxicities of checkpoint inhibitors . Patients in clinical trials have been highly selected for performance status and good organ function and thus toxicities may be worse in non-trial patient populations . Patients with pre-existing autoimmune toxicities have been excluded from trials of immunotherapies and thus toxicities may be greater in this group . It has not been possible to deliver the same doses of combination therapies used in melanoma to lung cancer patients . Grade 3/4 toxicities have been reported in fewer than 3% of patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; 9% treated with ipilimumab monotherapy, but 19% of patients who received combination therapy . Diarrhea of all grades occurs in 11-19% (grade 3/4 in 0-3%) of patients receiving PD-1 mAbs, and up to one-third of ipilimumab-treated patients (grade 3/4 in 3-6%) . However, with combination therapy, diarrhea occurs in up to 44% of patients (grade 3/4 9%) . Colitis (diarrhea, pain and bleeding/mucous) may develop in a small percentage of patients receiving PD-L1 mAbs, but occurs in 8-12% of both ipilimumab-treated (grade 3/4 in 3-6%) and combination-treated patients (grade 3/4 in 9%) . Occasionally, patients experience gastrointestinal perforation or severe colitis requiring colectomy . Liver dysfunction typically occurs 6-12 weeks after starting treatment . Skin toxicities, including pruritus and rash, occur in 14-22% (grade 3/4 in < 1%) of PD-1 mAb-treated patients, 15-35% of ipilimumab-treated patients (grade 3/4 in 1-2%) and 28-33% of patients receiving combination therapy (grade 3/4 2-3%) . Skin toxicities are more common in patients with melanoma than in patients with other tumor types . For example, evidence of hypothyroidism occurs in 4-10% of patients treated with PD-1 mAbs, 2-4% of ipilimumab-treated patients and 15% of combination-treated patients, although it is rarely severe . Fewer than 2% of patients receiving single agents have pituitary function abnormalities, compared with 8% of those who receive combination treatment . Pneumonitis is more common in patients with lung cancer than in those with melanoma . With the PD-1 mAbs, up to 5% of patients with lung cancer experience pneumonitis, which may be grade 3/4 in up to 2% . The incidence appears to be greater in patients who have received significant thoracic radiotherapy . Rheumatological toxicities, including arthralgias and myalgias, occur in 6-12% of patients, but are rarely severe or treatment limiting . Fatigue occurs in 15-34% of patients receiving single-agent therapy and 35% of those receiving combination treatment, among whom it may be severe in up to 4% . Management of toxicities . Patients and staff should be educated about the types of toxicity associated with immunotherapies, and patients should be provided with a card indicating that they are receiving a particular treatment . Expert nurses with knowledge of toxicities and their management should be employed to monitor patients' symptoms and provide education and advice about toxicity management . Toxicity grading systems should be understood . Permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy should be considered for patients with toxicity greater than grade 3 (Figure 4.3) . In symptomatic patients, treatment should be interrupted and steroids initiated as above for liver dysfunction . 
As can be seen, the evidence required for biosimilars is greater than that for generic versions of small molecule drugs . The biosimilar pathway . Central to this pathway is the demonstration that there are no significant clinical differences between the biosimilar and the reference biological product . There is no single analytic test for a biosimilar, whether chemical or clinical . Demonstration of the comparability of a biosimilar with its reference product follows a sequential process, as illustrated in Figure 4.1 . Non-clinical - some quality differences may emerge during quality comparability studies; this stage provides information about potential impact on safety and efficacy . Clinical - the purpose of the clinical assessment stage is to investigate differences that may have emerged earlier in the development program and to determine whether the biosimilar performs in a comparable way to the reference product in patients . The comparability of a biosimilar with the reference product must be demonstrated in at least one of the reference product's indications . The purpose of the study is to demonstrate comparability rather than to reconfirm the efficacy and safety of the active ingredient . The study design, endpoints, and patient population in a clinical comparability study of a biosimilar drug may differ from those in the original trial of the reference product, although the EMA recommends that some of the endpoints used for the reference product are included to support the comparability exercise . Figure 4.2 illustrates the data requirements for a biosimilar compared with its reference product; Table 4.2 provides specific details on the requirements . Biosimilars in the USA . For a biosimilar to be designated as interchangeable, proof is required that it will have the same expected clinical results in any given individual patient . This implies that post-marketing data from an already approved biosimilar will be required to gain the interchangeable status . The FDA has emphasized that the closer the analytic match of a biosimilar to the variation observed in the original reference drug, the less the requirement for clinical trial data . The greater any differences, the greater the requirements for demonstrating equivalence in Phase III trials . Biosimilars are typically approved for most, if not all, the indications of the originator brand, but without a need to provide clinical trial data using the biosimilar in all those indications . The clinical study is likely to involve the most sensitive patient group/study endpoint(s), selected in discussion with regulators . Therefore, at launch the comparability of a biosimilar with its reference product may have been demonstrated in only one of the reference product's indications . Further data may be required in order to demonstrate comparability if, for example, the drug has multiple sites of action, particularly if these have different relevance in different indications, or if there are differences between indications in terms of efficacy, safety or immunogenicity . Although clinical data are an important part of the regulatory review for a biosimilar, comparability with the reference drug based on non-clinical studies is an inherent part of the biosimilar pathway . The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) indicates whether indications have been approved on the basis of extrapolation or data from comparative clinical studies . This supported approval in all the same indications as for the originator, Remicade TM . The approval of the biosimilar anti-inflammatory drugs infliximab and etanercept has significantly changed the evidence for biosimilar extrapolation and switching . Concerns with 'intended copy' biologics . For less wealthy nations, abbreviated drug development and regulatory pathways for the approval of biosimilars can cut costs and deliver affordable medicines . Twelve such intended copy biologics were analyzed in a joint Thai-Dutch study . The problem with intended copy biologics is that they have neither the security of biosimilarity studies nor large volumes of clinical data to predict their safety and efficacy . In this example too, an intended copy biologic was misrepresented as a biosimilar . Real-world studies . European regulation of biosimilars . The agency adapted the 'biosimilar pathway' from the existing regulatory pathway designed for reference drugs following a manufacturing change . In contrast to originator drugs, which require pivotal clinical trials to gain new approved indications, biosimilars may gain approval by extrapolating the equivalence demonstrated in one approved indication to another . Clinical studies are required for additional indications if the approved indications have different mechanisms of action (MOA) or mechanisms of toxicity (MOT) that could suggest a potential risk to drug safety or efficacy . 
The development of drugs that target TNF has been an enormous advance . Adalimumab is a humanized mAb against TNF . Most recently, golimumab and certolizumab pegol have received regulatory approval for treating RA . These five TNF inhibitors show excellent effectiveness in both early and established RA . Patients who may benefit . Not all RA patients respond to TNF antagonists and, at present, there are no factors that reliably predict effectiveness . Their effectiveness approximates inversely with the duration of RA - thus they are more effective in early disease and least effective in very late disease . RA patients overall are at higher risk for serious infections than healthy peers . Despite initial concerns there is, as yet, no evidence that anti-TNF agents increase the risk of malignancy or lymphoma in RA patients, with the possible exception of non-melanoma skin cancers . In RA, however, there appears to be an imbalance that favors the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-1 . Overall, its effectiveness is less than TNF antagonists and other biological therapies . In the UK, NICE has not approved its use to treat RA . B cell depletion . Proof of the central role of B cells in RA pathogenesis has come from a novel therapeutic approach . Rituximab is a chimeric mAb specific for CD20, a phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of mature and naive B cells but absent from B cell precursors and plasma cells . Rituximab depletes circulating B cells and produces therapeutic benefit in RA similar to that achieved with TNF antagonists . It is approved for treatment of RA patients for whom anti-TNF therapy has failed . Infusion reactions are the most frequent adverse events reported with rituximab, affecting up to 30% of patients . They are most common with the first dose of the first course of therapy and are probably secondary to cytokine release associated with B cell lysis . No increased risk of infections or opportunistic infections has been noted in RA patients, even after multiple courses of therapy, although there is a cumulative reduction in Ig levels, particularly IgM, with repeated cycles of therapy . Recent reports of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy in a small number of patients receiving rituximab for RA remain unexplained, although the majority of the patients were receiving or had received additional immunosuppression . Abatacept is the first approved biological therapy that alters T cell function by blocking co-stimulatory pathways between APCs and T cells . By competing with CD28 for binding to CD80 and CD86, abatacept downregulates T cell activation . Clinical trials have demonstrated abatacept to be effective in RA patients with early disease as well as in disease refractory to methotrexate and TNF blockade . IL-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of RA (Figure 9.4) . Tocilizumab is a humanized anti IL-6 receptor (Il-6R) mAb that neutralizes the effects of IL-6 . Several phase III trials have demonstrated clinical efficacy in RA patients at all disease stages, from early disease to anti-TNF failure . As IL-6 plays a key role in immune surveillance, its inhibition might be expected to be associated with an increased risk of infections . The controlled trials suggest a possible slight increase in bacterial infections, similar to other biological therapies . There is no evidence for enhanced vascular events in patients receiving tocilizumab, although this is an area of continuing research with several biological therapies . Biological therapies have provided a major boost to our therapeutic options in RA, but there remains a significant research agenda surrounding their use . For example, all biological therapies can be immunogenic, provoking the development of potentially neutralizing antiglobulins in some, but not all, recipients . Understanding why some patients do not respond to biological therapies remains a major challenge and provides opportunities for further dissection of the pathogenic mechanisms operative in RA . Now that we have nine biological therapies approved to treat RA, our major challenge over the next several years will be directed towards how to best use these in individual patients . Management - biological therapies . Combined with advances in biotechnology, this has led to the development of several biological therapies for RA . Biological therapies are produced from living cells rather than by chemical synthesis and, generally, are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or soluble derivatives of cell surface receptors . 
Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening medical emergency characterized by frequent and/or prolonged epileptic seizures . Community-based studies in the USA suggest the incidence may be as high as 50 per 100000 people per year, peaking in children under 1 year of age and in adults over 60 years of age . With the aging of the population, it is likely that SE will become an increasingly important public health problem . This time frame is defined on the basis of decompensatory cerebral damage after 30 minutes of seizure activity when physiological changes fail to compensate for the increase in cerebral metabolism . Diagnosis of the latter can only be established by concurrent EEG recording . SE is a neurological emergency that requires immediate treatment . Mortality/morbidity . Mortality and morbidity reflect the underlying cause and the physiological effects of prolonged convulsions, including hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and hyperthermia . Mortality is as high as 10%, rising to 50% in elderly patients . Mortality is higher when SE is secondary to an acute insult (exempli gratia acute stroke, anoxia, trauma, infections, metabolic disturbance) . Conversely, SE resulting from a previous stroke, alcohol or AED withdrawal has a more favorable prognosis . A long duration of SE is associated with poor outcome . An effective management protocol should therefore be initiated immediately (Table 7.2) . Any delay in treatment worsens the prognosis and reduces the likelihood of stopping seizures without having to resort to general anesthesia . The importance of a coordinated effort in the treatment of convulsive SE - involving ambulance technicians, emergency medicine specialists, medical intensivists and neurological specialists - cannot be overemphasized . Most centers would initiate treatment with a benzodiazepine intravenously (most commonly lorazepam or diazepam), followed by phenytoin or fosphenytoin, or phenobarbital . Although not tested in randomized control trials, AEDs with intravenous formulations (exempli gratia sodium valproate, levetiracetam, lacosamide) are often used when first-line therapies fail . In persistent SE, it is important to watch for potential complications including hypothermia, acidosis, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, infection and cerebral edema . An underlying cause should continue to be investigated . Treatment response should be monitored clinically and with EEG . Seizure clusters . Some patients experience clusters of seizures (also called acute repetitive seizures) lasting from minutes to hours . Patients with frontal lobe epilepsy are particularly prone to clustering of seizures at night . Seizure clustering may occur around menstruation in women, or when patients do not take their usual AED therapy . In most cases, however, precipitating factors cannot be readily identified . These seizure clusters may not be defined as SE but nonetheless require therapeutic intervention . Acute treatment with a benzodiazepine such as clobazam after the first seizure can be given in an attempt to prevent further attacks . If the seizure cluster has occurred as a result of AED omission or dose reduction, reintroduction of the drug may be sufficient to abort it . During a seizure cluster, oral therapy in a child may be problematic and intravenous access is usually unavailable or difficult . Rectal diazepam administered by parents or other caregivers may be effective in this situation . Rectal diazepam is absorbed more rapidly than rectal lorazepam or oral diazepam because of its high lipid solubility . A gel-containing prefilled unit-dose rectal delivery system is commercially available . The doses used in clinical studies (0.5 mg/kg for children aged 2-5 years, 0.3 mg/kg for children aged 6-11 years, 0.2 mg/kg for those over 12 years) were effective and well tolerated, and did not produce respiratory depression . The most common side effect was somnolence . Buccal midazolam, available in Europe, is being increasingly used instead of rectal diazepam . In adults and children over 10 years of age, 10 mg can be given and repeated once if necessary . Lower amounts can be used in younger children . Nasal formulations of benzodiazepines are under development . Excessive use of rectal diazepam can result in rebound seizures . 
Role of products . Digital products are also used in health research to develop knowledge of the fundamental determinants of health and illness by examining biological, environmental and lifestyle factors . In observational and interventional research, digital technologies are increasingly used in the prevention and treatment of disease and to support health promotion . As a discipline, digital medicine encapsulates both broad professional expertise and responsibilities concerning the use of these digital tools . Digital medicine focuses on evidence generation to support the use of these technologies . They are used independently or in concert with medications, devices or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes . Digital intervention products are not the primary focus of this book, however . Combination products both measure and intervene . For example, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for people with diabetes share data from a patient automatically with their doctor's office using a companion app . Over time, this cycle may become more of a closed loop, with less need for human intervention in response to routine changes . Digital health . For example, using an accelerometer manufactured for the consumer market to measure physical activity among research participants enrolled in a clinical trial is common . However, this would require a reasonable body of evidence to support this use (see chapter 9 on verification and validation) . We have decided not to use the term 'digital health' . While it is one of the buzziest catchphrases in the industry today, it has been so broadly used and misinterpreted that it has no real meaning . Algorithms, machine learning and artificial intelligence . These data (exempli gratia from a sensor) are processed, transformed and used to build computational models with output that represents the health indicators of interest . For example, an algorithm is required to transform the raw data from a three-axis accelerometer into the more widely usable health indicator of step counts . There are a variety of different approaches to this task, yielding a variety of different performance characteristics . Importantly, the more examples of real-world walking that the algorithm has access to - by people of different shapes and sizes, under different conditions - the greater the opportunity to improve the accuracy of the model . Digital measurements in medicine today . Similarly, remotely monitoring patients with implanted heart devices allows doctors to better follow their cardiac patients, detecting abnormal heart rhythms and problems with the device sooner . Digital measures are also used in clinical research to better monitor patients and more efficiently assess safety and efficacy . For example, in-hospital ambulatory cardiac monitoring has existed for many years, enabling real-time monitoring of EKG signals . Similarly, portable EKG technologies have also existed; these recorded signals for later analysis . Across therapeutic areas and technologies, digital medicine solutions can solve weaknesses of existing solutions, and can come to market with more patient-friendly packages . Recovery, performance and treatment selection . In patients recovering from orthopedic surgery, app-enabled wearable sensors are increasingly being used during rehabilitation . Digital measurements, such as range of motion and step count, allow remote monitoring of a patxient's progress . More sophisticated measurements can monitor in real-time if a patient is doing their rehab exercises . Real-time safety monitoring . Digital fall detection systems allow remote monitoring of elderly and frail individuals . Such monitoring often relies on wearable sensors, cameras, motion sensors, microphones and/or floor sensors . Treatment adherence . One of the thorniest problems in routine clinical care can now be measured under limited circumstances . An ingestible sensor embedded in a medication is available to monitor when a pill is taken . When the sensor interacts with stomach acid, it transmits to a patch sensor worn over the abdomen . 9 Other innovations, like 'smart packs', integrate sensors into the packaging of medicines to record when the drug was administered and deliver automatic reminders to take a medication . Multimodal data integration . Potential applications in clinical research include the following . Data collected from remote sensors could be used as a novel endpoint for hard-to-measure conditions like Parkinson's . Digital measures are being used to assess medication adherence in clinical trials using smart blister packages for investigational drugs . Digital measures may inform better decisions about whether to progress a drug from early phase trials to later, larger and more costly trials . These are known as 'go/no go' decisions . Digital measures may be particularly important to inform these decisions where current measures are subjective and/or where there is a high failure rate . 
The last of these is caused by deamination of cytosine, resulting in a sequence change to thymidine (C:G to T:A) during PCR . NGS is not optimal for assessing repeat sequences . Those platforms utilized for sequencing very short fragments may miss large deletions (more than 20 bp) . One problem common to all platforms is loss of signal quality due to some of the molecules falling out of phase during the sequencing, with different residues being added . This results in inaccurate linking of molecules from the same sequence, so that structural variations and splicing changes could be missed . The data from sequencing give numerous signals, many of which are low quality and need to be filtered out . Newer generation drugs targeting these subclones may be indicated . Developments in sequencing . The current platforms rely on clonal PCR to generate a signal . Theoretically, techniques to determine single-molecule sequencing would be preferable . Third-generation sequencing methods, also termed large-fragment single-molecule sequencing, aim to sequence long DNA and RNA molecules . Oxford Nanopore technology does not require new molecule synthesis . Single-stranded DNA molecules are fed through minute pores in an electrically resistant membrane . The molecule disrupts the current and from the pattern of disruption the DNA sequence can be inferred . History of gene sequencing . This method, which was the basis of the Human Genome Project, essentially allowed a net signal to be derived from a pool of molecules, to give a collective sequence . Technology was developed that could generate millions of sequencing reactions per run: 'next-generation sequencing' . NGS methods . However, this is usually not necessary, and sequencing of the exons of known genes - whole-exome sequencing (WES) - is more appropriate . In some circumstances, information is required only for a limited number of genes or for hotspots in those genes; this is known as targeted sequencing . Sequencing provides information on cancer biomarkers that may be prognostic, predictive and/or pharmacotherapeutic . Current methods of clinical NGS . Sequencing involves a common workflow, from DNA extraction, to library preparation, target enrichment, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis . DNA extraction from tumor cells can be carried out using virtually any method . All methods ultimately result in DNA fragmentation and the addition of adapters to the fragment ends . Adapters may include molecular barcodes (to allow for pooling of patient samples), a sequence recognized by universal PCR primers, hybridization sequences to bind the DNA fragments to a surface, and recognition sites to initiate sequencing . The term library refers to these DNA fragments with flanking adapters that are ready for sequencing . The size of DNA fragment between the adapters is the insert size . Target enrichment . The resulting library undergoes enrichment for specific regions of interest for whole-exome analysis and/or targeted sequencing of specific genes . Enrichment may occur by hybridization to complementary sequences (sequence capture) or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . Sequence capture is preferred for large genomic regions and PCR for smaller regions where greater enrichment is required . Sequencing is performed using one of the two major platforms, Illumina or Ion Torrent . Illumina-based sequencing is relatively rapid as direct imaging increases the detection speed, in contrast to camera-based imaging . This can interfere with the generation of an accurate consensus sequence, thereby reducing the number of cycles that can occur . Illumina sequencing can be used for genomic sequencing, exomic and targeted sequencing, metagenomics, RNA sequencing, ChIP-seq and methylome methods . Advantages of NGS over older methods . Sanger sequencing is a very accurate method of sequencing that can analyze relatively large DNA fragments . All NGS platforms capture the individual sequences of millions of molecules, while standard sequencing methods (Sanger sequencing) deliver a net signal derived from a pool of molecules, a collective sequence . NGS, in contrast, can sequence multiple targets in one reaction rather than one target/reaction . As NGS sequences multiple fragments, multiple times, it has higher sensitivity and can therefore detect variants that occur at lower frequencies . NGS is far more rapid and also cheaper for sequencing multiple targets than standard methods . As NGS samples can be multiplexed, NGS has higher throughput . 
Nearly all low-grade lymphomas are of B-cell origin although occasional T-cell lymphomas, such as angio-immunoblastic lymphoma, can behave in an indolent fashion . The most common low-grade B-cell lymphomas are . follicular lymphoma . mantle cell lymphoma . marginal zone lymphoma . small lymphocytic lymphoma . Most patients with indolent lymphomas die of their disease . Follicular lymphoma . Follicular lymphoma is a common, usually nodal, lymphoma with a relatively high rate of transformation to high-grade disease (Table 6.1) . It is one of the commonest forms of low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), representing 25% of all lymphoma cases . Follicular lymphoma in the bone marrow presents as a characteristic paratrabecular infiltrate . Clinical presentation . Although many patients present with painless enlargement of lymph nodes, most are found to have widespread disease after staging (see Figure 6.1) . com/lymphoid/lymphoma/flipi2) . bone-marrow involvement . Early-stage disease . Most low-grade lymphomas are remarkably radiosensitive, so this may be the treatment of choice for patients with localized disease . In fact, some studies suggest that radiotherapy alone may be curative in about 50% of patients with early-stage disease . Advanced disease . Mantle cell lymphoma . Mantle cell lymphoma is an aggressive low-grade NHL representing 4-8% of all lymphomas; it has the worst outcome of any of the B-cell lymphomas . Mantle cell lymphoma arises from small atypical lymphoid cells in the mantle zone of secondary lymphoid follicles (Figure 6.2) . Clinical presentation . Staging investigations usually reveal widespread disease involving the spleen, bone marrow and, not uncommonly, abnormal circulating cells in the blood . Low Ki-67 expression may be associated with this group of patients . The optimal treatment of mantle cell lymphoma is unclear . If these are well tolerated, patients are sometimes considered for autologous transplantation . A subset of patients with mantle cell lymphoma present more like an indolent lymphoma - they frequently have a peripheral blood lymphocytosis, splenic and marrow involvement, but minimal, if any, lymphadenopathy . Marginal zone lymphoma . Marginal zone lymphomas (Table 6.3) can be divided into three main subtypes . Clinical presentation . MALT lymphoma of the stomach is the most common form of marginal zone lymphoma . It mainly affects patients over 50 years of age . These patients tend to have widespread disease, fail to respond to H . Thyroid marginal zone lymphoma may lead to tracheal compression and stridor . Cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma, while less frequently seen, still represents one of the commonest forms of skin lymphoma . Splenectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with SLVL . However, the condition appears to overlap with other indolent lymphomas, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the marginal zone lymphomas . There are almost no specific diagnostic markers for this disease . Distinguishing these lymphomas from marginal zone lymphomas is difficult and some authors would consider LPL a variant of marginal cell lymphoma . Clinical presentation . Relapsed disease may require combination chemotherapy, such as CHOP . Patients presenting with hyperviscosity may require urgent plasma exchange to lower the IgM level . Small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/CLL is the most common low-grade B-cell lymphoma (Table 6.5) . The disorder is usually referred to as small lymphocytic lymphoma when there is almost no 'blood spill' (spillage of lymphocytes into the peripheral blood) and the patient presents with lymphadenopathy . Clinical presentation . No treatment is necessary in the early stages of the disease . FCR is first choice for younger fitter patients who require therapy . These drugs have shown significant activity in relapsed patients . The prognosis is variable and some patients respond poorly to chemotherapy . 
Early detection of impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance allows early intervention with appropriate lifestyle change and can defer and even prevent the onset of diabetes . Thus, early detection plays an important role in optimizing health . Glucose levels . The diagnosis of diabetes has changed progressively over the last couple of decades; criteria have become simplified and now recognize that diabetic complications occur with glucose levels previously considered normal . The current diagnostic cut-offs are listed in Table 2.1 and reflect the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines of 2013 . Fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) is generally diagnostic of diabetes mellitus . Random glucose > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is also diagnostic in a patient with polyuria, polydipsia or unexplained weight loss . These cut-offs establish the diagnosis of diabetes, after which it is left to the clinician to consider and determine the cause or type of diabetes . This can be determined on clinical findings and, if required, other investigations or antibody testing . Further characterization of diabetes types is discussed on Determination of type, Chapter 2 . Impaired fasting glucose . It is now recognized that a fasting glucose level between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L (100-125 mg/dL) is 'prediabetic' . Studies show these individuals are already developing diabetic complications such as microalbuminuria and are at increased cardiovascular risk . Thus, early detection is important for early intervention for complication development . Further, there is increasing evidence that the beta cell dysfunction in prediabetes may be impacted by early lifestyle intervention, such that progression of the beta cell secretory impairment might be slowed . Glucose tolerance testing . Glucose tolerance should be formally tested when glucose levels fall short of diagnostic cut-offs and the patient is considered 'at-risk' (Table 2.2) . A glucose tolerance test focuses on the 2-hour glucose response following a 75 g oral glucose load . The glucose load is given as a drink . Cut-offs are given in Table 2.1: essentially a 2-hour glucose response > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is diagnostic of diabetes and < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) considered normal . The glucose tolerance test is a useful provocation test that can be used for early detection of diabetes in the at-risk patient (see Table 2.2) . It is also diagnostically useful in women with impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L [100-125 mg/dL]), for whom the fasting glucose test is less sensitive for diabetes . The current ADA criteria require confirmation by repeat testing on a subsequent day . For example, it would not be necessary to confirm in a young hyperglycemic patient with symptoms of hyperglycemia who has early ketoacidosis . Glycated hemoglobin levels . Recent international standardization of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) has allowed this simple measure to be used for diabetes diagnosis . The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a diabetes diagnostic cut-off of >= 48 mmol/mol (>= 6.5%) . A value less than 6.5% does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests . In patients receiving corticosteroids, fasting glucose levels are often normal; steroid effects on glucose metabolism do not usually manifest till mid-afternoon . Therefore, in these patients, the best time to screen is with a random glucose level between 15:00 and 17:00 hours . In those diagnosed with diabetes, it is important to distinguish between the different types . Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) provides a good example . It may appear identical to type 2 diabetes but be difficult to manage with standard oral medications, with patients progressing to insulin therapy . Recent studies show that early instigation of insulin therapy in this diabetes subgroup is associated with better glycemic control than use of sulfonylureas; a large randomized study is currently under way . Antibody testing should be considered if the individual with diabetes has any of the following features . strong family history of diabetes without obesity for which insulin therapy was required . Other types of diabetes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 . Seeking appropriate clinical signs is useful . 
This tilting of the balance to protect against bleeding, however, results in a marked increase in thrombotic risk . Gestational thrombocytopenia . Primary immune thrombocytopenia . It is therefore prudent to recheck the count after a few days . It is not possible to predict the cord blood platelet count in advance of delivery . Furthermore, cesarean section does not appear to offer any greater protection to the neonate than an uncomplicated vaginal delivery . The use of forceps, however, should be avoided . Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia . A platelet antigen present on fetal and paternal, but not maternal, platelets stimulates the development of a specific antiplatelet antibody . The condition is often associated with intracranial hemorrhage in the fetus during gestation or at delivery . If the fetus is likely to have the antigen, there is a high risk of recurrence . Possible interventions include intrauterine transfusions of maternal HPA-1A-negative platelets . Disseminated intravascular coagulation . Clinical presentation . Conditions causing the consumptive coagulopathy are listed in Table 10.1 . Clinically, the patient may present with . a trigger, such as placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism . the hemorrhagic and cardiovascular complications of DIC (exempli gratia ecchymoses, hematuria and shock) . thrombotic complications in the brain, kidney or lung . A fibrinogen level lower than would be expected for the gestational period is diagnostic . Thus, a fibrinogen level within the normal adult non-pregnant range (1.5-4.0 g/L) is relatively reduced for the stage of gestation . The precipitating cause should be treated as quickly as possible . Placental abruption is the most common cause of a severe consumptive coagulopathy . Urgent cesarean section is required in an attempt to save the fetus, and to limit hemorrhage and coagulopathy . The management of massive blood loss is discussed in Chapter 12 . Amniotic fluid embolization is a catastrophic event characterized by sudden severe dyspnea, hypotension and bleeding . Acute pulmonary hypertension occurs and fetal squames and hair, for example, are discovered in the pulmonary alveoli . Urgent resuscitative measures including ventilatory support and blood products are required . The coagulopathy can sometimes be managed by giving intravenous heparin that interrupts the consumptive process . It may take several days for coagulation to return to normal to allow evacuation of the uterus . Carriers of congenital bleeding disorders . This situation is most commonly encountered with carriers of severe hemophilia when the mother may have a FVIII level of less than 50% . The fetal sex can be determined reliably after week 9 of gestation from a peripheral blood sample using a Y-specific genetic probe that detects fragments of the fetal Y chromosome in the maternal circulation . Antenatal diagnosis can be determined by chorionic villus sampling at 11 weeks' gestation and the use of genetic techniques to determine if the fetus has hemophilia . Von Willebrand disease . In one study, epidural anesthesia was administered to 15 women at the time of 17 deliveries and there were no complications associated with this procedure . However, 47% of these women had postpartum hemorrhage . Uncommon bleeding disorders . Deficiencies of fibrinogen and FXIII are associated with recurrent miscarriages and placental abruption . Patients with low levels of FII, FV, FVII, FX and FXI often have postpartum hemorrhages . Also, the neonates of these women may be affected if the father is a carrier of the disorder . Obstetric hemorrhage . Major obstetric hemorrhage is life-threatening; the principal causes are listed in Table 10.2 . Once major bleeding is revealed or suspected, prompt intervention is required . While red cells and fresh frozen plasma are often needed to support the circulation, other fluids should be limited so as to avoid a dilutional coagulopathy . Furthermore, the underlying cause must be attended to immediately (exempli gratia retained placenta) . 
The liver is uniquely positioned, both anatomically and metabolically, to receive the brunt of potential insults; thus, medications have the potential to induce liver disease, and at least 1000 drugs have been implicated . Prompt recognition of DILI is important because continued use of the drug often results in poor outcome . DILI typically presents in one of three clinical patterns (Table 4.1) . Specific medications typically produce a specific and reproducible pattern of liver injury, referred to as the hepatotoxicity profile of the drug . Paracetamol is an example . Hepatotoxicity due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an example . Isoniazid is an example . Drugs commonly associated with hepatotoxicity . These drugs are so effective that they are in very common use . As a group the statins are very safe, with fewer than 2% of patients enrolled in clinical trials discontinuing the medications for any reason . Most patients are asymptomatic and have no signs suggestive of liver dysfunction on physical examination . Severe liver injury has been reported but is rare . Periodic monitoring of liver tests is recommended, although there is no evidence that monitoring prevents serious liver disease . The abnormalities are generally not progressive and may resolve despite continued use of the drug . Nevertheless, if significant persistent elevations in liver tests occur, the statin should be discontinued . Starting a different statin once the liver abnormalities have resolved, and monitoring the patient's liver tests for a period, is appropriate . A common clinical question is whether to use a statin in a patient with pre-existing liver disease . A retrospective study found that patients with baseline elevated aminotransferases were no more likely to develop further elevation in liver tests when taking a statin than were patients with abnormal aminotransferases who were not taking statins . Thus, it is probably acceptable to use the statins in patients with chronic stable liver disease, provided symptoms and liver tests are monitored . Statins are contraindicated in patients with acute liver disease and those with advanced chronic liver disease (elevated bilirubin, depressed albumin, clinically apparent cirrhosis, etc . Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is a remarkably safe drug, but in certain circumstances it has significant hepatotoxicity . Lower doses, typically used without suicidal intent, can induce severe liver injury in patients who chronically use alcohol or who are malnourished . In these patients, doses within the therapeutic range (id est about 4 g) may be hepatotoxic . Patients with intersects below the line in the nomogram are at little risk for hepatotoxicity . Activated charcoal should be given when the patient presents within 8 hours of ingestion . N -acetylcysteine is the definitive treatment for paracetamol overdose . Significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon when N -acetylcysteine is given within 8 hours of overdose . It is therefore imperative that N -acetylcysteine is given early (typically while awaiting paracetamol serum levels) and continued if significant hepatotoxicity has developed . If the nomogram suggests little chance of hepatotoxicity, N -acetylcysteine can be discontinued . Two types of hepatotoxicity are recognized . This occurs in approximately 20% of patients, who remain asymptomatic . Isoniazid should be continued and the patient monitored for symptoms and worsening liver tests . Often the liver test abnormalities will resolve despite continuing isoniazid . About half of patients with clinical isoniazid hepatitis will develop symptoms within a few months of starting the drug, although presentations after as long as 12 months have been reported . Isoniazid should be stopped immediately and the patient observed closely . At a minimum, patients who start taking isoniazid should be educated to recognize and report any symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction . Patients with symptoms should be evaluated promptly and thoroughly . Guidelines for monitoring asymptomatic patients for hepatotoxicity vary . The US Centers for Disease Control recommend liver tests before treatment and then periodically during treatment only in patients at high risk for hepatotoxicity (Table 4.2) . Others, reasoning that concomitant use of other drugs with hepatotoxic potential (rifampicin [rifampin] and pyrazinamide) is so common, recommend liver tests at regular intervals . 
The synovial membrane intima is just one or two cell layers thick and contains two major cell types: type A synoviocytes, which bear macrophage markers, and type B synoviocytes, which have fibroblastic characteristics . The matrix of the intima is rich in proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, in particular hyaluronic acid . Synovial fluid . Articular cartilage . Articular cartilage comprises chondrocytes embedded in a hydrated matrix composed of collagen, proteoglycans and other matrix proteins . It is an avascular structure lacking lymphatics, and the synovial fluid is critical for providing nutrients to this tissue . These cells are critical to the integrity of articular cartilage because they synthesize collagen, proteoglycans and also other components such as fibronectin . Each cell is surrounded by a zone of secreted proteoglycans and a basket-like mantle of fibrillar collagen, but the highest collagen content occurs in the more distal intercellular matrix . Collagens are fibrillar proteins that, together with proteoglycans, account for the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage . There are 14 different types of collagen, divided into three major groups . The predominant collagen in articular cartilage is type II, constituting approximately 90% in the adult, with types IX and XI contributing most of the remainder . All collagens are based on a triple helical structure (Figure 1.2), and the differences between collagens relate to the length of the triple helix, the presence of non-collagenous units within the molecule that impart extra flexibility, or the addition of non-collagenous side-chains such as carbohydrates . The triple helical structure of collagens accounts for their tensile strength . Collagen biosynthetic and degradative pathways are quite well characterized . Proteoglycans are large negatively charged macromolecules comprising a polypeptide core with glycosaminoglycan side-chains . The largest family of proteoglycans in articular cartilage is the aggrecans, which contain abundant chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate side-chains . They are complexed with hyaluronic acid and so-called link protein . Their main function relates to their anionic and water-trapping properties, which provide deformability and compressibility . The ratio of collagen to aggrecan is high in the superficial layers of articular cartilage and drops progressively toward the subchondral bone . Breakdown of collagen and the surrounding matrix is mediated by enzymes such as collagenase, gelatinase, stromelysin and aggrecanase, which are zinc-dependent metalloproteinases . Subchondral bone . The basal layer of articular cartilage is calcified and is attached directly to subchondral bone, which has a similar structure . Collagen I comprises most of the collagen present in bone, however, and is calcified with hydroxyapatite . This provides bone with both tensile and compressive strength . The remaining bone matrix is made up of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid, and proteins such as osteocalcin; as in articular cartilage, these are incorporated into macromolecular complexes . Glycoproteins such as osteopontin, osteonectin and bone sialoproteins function as anchoring molecules, bridging matrix constituents such as collagen to bone cells . Bone also contains important growth factors such as IGF-1 and 2, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) which are members of the TGFbeta superfamily . Bone contains two major cell types: osteoblasts and osteoclasts . Mesenchymal osteoblasts are critical for the synthesis of collagen and bone matrix (osteoid) . Conversely, osteoclasts - multinucleate cells of macrophage lineage - break down bone via a combination of lysosomal enzymes and low pH . Bone is constantly remodeled to fulfill two major functions . To optimize load-bearing capacity, bone is remodeled according to compressive forces acting upon it . Bone remodeling also plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis, particularly of calcium and magnesium . In young adults, bone formation and destruction are carefully balanced to maintain overall bone mass . 
Symptomatic management can result in a significant improvement in quality of life for patients with brain metastases . All patients on prolonged corticosteroids should receive prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . Anticonvulsants are indicated for any patient presenting with a seizure . Prophylactic anticonvulsants have not been shown to be effective and therefore only complicate patient management, increasing the risk of medication-related side effects . Non-convulsive status epilepticus should be considered in any patient with an altered level of consciousness (see Fast Facts: Epilepsy) . Radiotherapy and surgery . Standard therapy for a patient with newly diagnosed brain metastasis remains whole-brain radiotherapy . About 50% of patients die from progressive neurological disease; the remainder die as a result of systemic tumor progression . Aggressive focused management of brain metastases may improve the prognosis for some patients . In this patient group, the median survival with either of these approaches is 8-9 months . These results, while encouraging, have been obtained in highly selected patient populations, most of whom had a high Karnofsky performance status, limited systemic tumor burden and small brain metastases . Such patients have an inherently better prognosis, and consequently these results may not be easily extrapolated to all patients . While early whole-brain radiotherapy improves local control, there is no clear survival benefit . As a result, many practitioners are inclined to defer whole-brain radiotherapy until there is progressive disease in the brain . Use of chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is generally disappointing . Unfortunately, by the time most patients develop brain metastases, they have already been exposed to the most effective chemotherapeutic agents and the metastatic clones are relatively chemoresistant . In spite of this, chemotherapy may be useful in treating some individuals with brain metastases . Newly diagnosed patients who are chemotherapy naïve and neurologically asymptomatic may respond favorably to systemic chemotherapy . In particular, patients with brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer or choriocarcinoma may have a better than average response to chemotherapy . Chemotherapy or radiosensitizing agents may be combined with whole-brain radiotherapy in an attempt to improve the outcome compared with either modality alone . A European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study found a significant survival advantage for patients with small-cell lung cancer treated with teniposide in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy, when compared with teniposide alone . Similarly, a significant improvement in radiographic response was seen in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases who were treated with temozolomide in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy, when compared with whole-brain radiotherapy alone . Finally, chemotherapy may be useful in the setting of recurrent brain metastases . At recurrence, most patients have multiple lesions that are not amenable to radiosurgery or focal therapy . Furthermore, the majority have active and often symptomatic systemic tumors . This clinical scenario makes palliative chemotherapy an appropriate intervention . Brain metastases . Improvements in therapy for systemic cancer have increased the number of patients living long enough to develop symptomatic brain metastases . Indeed, brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumor . In particular, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive (Her2+) breast cancer patients with systemic disease controlled with trastuzumab appear to have an increased risk of developing brain metastases . Thus, the development of new strategies to prevent and treat brain metastases is increasingly important . Approximately 1 in 4 patients with cancer will develop a brain metastasis; patients with melanoma, lung or breast cancer are at the greatest risk (Table 4.1) . Most patients present with headaches or focal neurological deficits; 20% or more present with or develop seizures . There is often significant surrounding edema . Patients with a new diagnosis of brain metastasis should be systemically restaged as appropriate for their primary tumor . The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has delineated specific prognostic categories for patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases (Table 4.2) . These may be helpful in determining appropriate treatment options and long-term plans (exempli gratia hospice care) for individual patients . A treatment algorithm for newly diagnosed brain metastasis is shown in Figure 4.4 . 
Hemophilia A is about five times more common than hemophilia B . Molecular genetics of hemophilia A and B . The causative mutations for hemophilia A and B are found in the genes for FVIII and FIX, respectively . For individuals not diagnosed at birth, the age at which the patient clinically presents with a bleed will usually depend on the severity of the hemophilia . Those with severe hemophilia usually experience their first bleed at about 6-9 months of age, when they start to become mobile and hemarthroses occur . Many bleeds in patients with severe hemophilia are apparently 'spontaneous', without a history of trauma, and occur as often as once or twice a week . Boys with moderate (1-5% factor levels) or mild (> 5%) hemophilia usually present with bleeding episodes later, the age depending on the FVIII or FIX level . Those with moderate hemophilia bleed after minor trauma, while those with mild hemophilia usually only bleed after major trauma or surgery . Sites of bleeding . The most common sites for bleeds are large joints: for example, the knees, elbows, ankles, hips and shoulders . The individual is usually aware that a bleed is starting before there are any signs of swelling or limitation of movement . Untreated bleeding continues until the joint is tense, swollen and exceedingly painful . Muscle atrophy around the joint leads to instability and further predisposes to bleeding . Unless treated early and effectively, several bleeds into a joint will weaken it considerably (Figure 6.2) . When this happens, it is known as a 'target joint' . Without adequate and prompt treatment, patients with severe hemophilia develop progressive degenerative arthrosis of the knees, elbows, ankles and hips, and eventually become severely physically disabled . Muscle hematomas are also characteristic of hemophilia . Bleeding often begins insidiously and may have been occurring for some time before discomfort is noticed; as a result, a patient may eventually present with a large hematoma . Even minor trauma can precipitate hemorrhage, and occasionally bleeds occur spontaneously . Bleeding is usually into the substance of the cerebrum . In an undiagnosed patient with hemophilia, bleeding may not be excessive during an operation, but persistent oozing over several days leads to a large hematoma . Treatment should be continued until bleeding has stopped . Further treatment may be necessary to prevent recurrent bleeding during mobilization and physiotherapy . Treatment can be problematic in those patients with higher levels of antibody, because the infused FVIII is immediately neutralized and consequently therapy is ineffective . These treatments are not, however, as effective as FVIII in a patient without an inhibitor . Inhibitors are rare in patients with hemophilia B . Female carriers of hemophilia A and B can be identified from the family history alone . Alternatively, intragenic FVIII/FIX polymorphisms can be used to track the hemophilia gene in the family . If the fetus is diagnosed as having hemophilia, a termination can be offered . Infections transmitted by clotting factor concentrates . From the late 1970s until 1986, HIV contaminated clotting factor concentrates, which resulted in the infection of many patients . About 60% of patients with severe hemophilia in the UK and 95% of those in the USA became infected with HIV, and virtually all patients who received concentrate also became infected with HCV . Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin cures up to 50% of patients with HCV infection . Newer drugs under development offer the possibility of effective treatment for all patients with HCV . Unlike congenital hemophilia, patients present with extensive subcutaneous bruising, compartment syndromes and genito- or gastrointestinal bleeding (bleeding into joints is very rare) . Treatment depends on the level of the inhibitory antibody and the severity of the bleeding; recombinant FVIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrates are generally more effective than FVIII and desmopressin . Treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide is usually started at diagnosis and appears to promote the disappearance of the anti-FVIII antibody . 
When investigating a new patient presenting with any joint problems, it is usual to try to differentiate OA from primary inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . The occupational and social history is often useful in determining the 'lifetime load' to which a patient's joints have been exposed . Assessment of joint pain and its consequences . Pain is a complex and personal experience, but some effort should be made to assess pain severity . People with OA report many different patterns of pain: for example, worse with weight-bearing, worse after prolonged sitting, or predominant night pain . Even night pain is complex and may be reported as pain after getting into bed that eases off, pain when the knees bump against each other that wakes the individual, or a deep-seated pain that wakes the individual . The pathological significance of these different pains is unclear, but it may be that different treatments are required . Of course, any history of newly occurring night pain, especially in a young patient, should prompt a search for bony tumors . Many patients presenting with OA may have had symptoms for a long time . When taking a history, it is worthwhile making some simple assessment of features associated with chronic pain, including sleep disturbance and mood alteration (see Fast Facts: Chronic and Cancer Pain) . Assessment of quality of life . Some assessment of functional limitations associated with the particular joint disorder is required . Importantly, the effect of joint pain on occupation should be noted . As mentioned previously, many people with OA of one joint will have pain in other joint areas . The usual OA age group has significant comorbidities, which must be assessed in order to guide therapy appropriately . General inspection of the individual joint will include observation of gait and looking for previous surgical scars or joint deformity . Examination findings in the OA joint may include . tenderness (most marked over the joint line) . The following sections highlight important points in the examination of individual joints . Prolonged hand pain of any cause will result in poor grip strength . The symptom of groin pain tends to be specific to the hip joint . Active or passive movement of the hip joint will often reproduce the patient's symptoms and it is important to ask if this is the case . They may be asymptomatic or present with . difficulties in completely flexing the joint . aching and tenderness posterior to the knee after exercise . In general, the diagnosis of OA is based on clinical history and examination; since this disease generally presents with symptoms, these should be addressed first . Primarily, the task force concluded that imaging is not required for the diagnosis of typical presentations of OA (id est patients over 40 years old who present with usage-related pain, short duration morning stiffness, and symptoms in one or more joints) . small calcified foreign bodies (these are usually of little clinical significance in the absence of true knee locking) . Although MRI has improved our understanding of the pathology and causes of pain in OA, it has no role in the routine assessment of the OA joint . Aspiration of small joints in such cases may be aided by ultrasound guidance . The major differential diagnosis for multiple hand small-joint pain and swelling is between RA and OA with secondary inflammation . Polyarticular gout can sometimes complicate OA of small joints . In the person with longstanding rotator cuff pathology or other trauma, true glenohumeral OA may be present . Many patients believe that hip pain occurs on the outer lateral aspect of the thigh and this is commonly what presents as 'hip pain' . However, true hip pain is generally felt in the groin or deep buttock (and may occasionally be referred to the thigh or knee) . Patients with true hip disease often have difficulty putting on shoes and socks . pain on the outer aspect of the thigh that is worse when lying on at night or with repeated walking and weight bearing . pain radiating down the outside of the thigh to the knee . True hip OA may often have an element of trochanteric bursitis as well . At the knee . In the typical older patient with OA, a history of a knee 'giving way' usually reflects quadriceps weakness rather than ligamentous instability or a meniscal problem . The differential diagnosis of problems with the first metatarsophalangeal joint is most often between OA, a bunion and gout . 
Once a diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is strongly suspected, treatment must be initiated as soon as possible . Delays in initiating treatment have been associated with early mortality . Therefore, the initial management for a patient with suspected TTP will typically involve empiric plasma exchange therapy, which should usually be started before the diagnosis is confirmed . Plasma exchange therapy . The introduction of plasma exchange therapy revolutionized the treatment of TTP . It remains the mainstay of acute TTP treatment . Nearly 90% of patients will survive an acute TTP episode with plasma exchange therapy whereas, in contrast, there was near uniform mortality prior to the discovery of its effectiveness in TTP . Because of this, it is imperative to start plasma exchange as soon as possible . Plasma exchange should be continued until disease response is achieved; response is defined as a platelet count above 150 x 10 /L for two consecutive days . The expected response to plasma exchange would be a gradual decline in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) followed by an increase in platelet count . This provides reassurance that the patient is responding well to therapy . A clinical response (platelet count > 150 x 10 /L) would be expected 4-6 days after starting plasma exchange therapy . In the absence of convincing data, the most effective method of stopping plasma exchange has been debated . There are, however, no randomized controlled trials that compare the efficacy of plasma exchange plus steroids with plasma exchange alone . Steroid treatments are typically continued throughout plasma exchange therapy . Rituximab has been used increasingly in recent years as more data have accumulated to demonstrate its efficacy in patients with refractory or relapsing TTP . It is typically given immediately after plasma exchange to minimize its clearance by the procedure . Caplacizumab was approved by both European Union and US regulatory authorities for the treatment of TTP in conjunction with plasma exchange and immune suppression . This provides effective protection from recurrence for the patient until immunosuppressive therapy can improve the patient's ADAMTS13 activity . Supportive care during acute episodes . During the acute phase, complete blood count (CBC) and LDH should be monitored daily to help judge the response to immunosuppressive and plasma exchange therapy . Disease-response definitions . Refractory TTP has been defined as a persistent thrombocytopenia, the lack of a sustained platelet count increment or a platelet count < 50 x 10 /L and an elevated LDH despite five plasma exchanges and steroid treatment . Treatment for refractory TTP should be tailored, based on response to initial therapy, but consideration should be given to . increasing the frequency of plasma exchange to twice daily . Additional treatments that have been reported to have efficacy for refractory TTP include both ciclosporin and bortezomib . Acute treatment . Patients with cTTP do not have an ADAMTS13 autoantibody that needs to be removed, and therefore plasma exchange is not required . Some individuals with cTTP may require only intermittent plasma infusions to treat acute episodes, while others may require ongoing prophylactic therapy to prevent symptoms and treat ongoing microangiopathic findings . Patients are infused daily until the platelet count recovers to normal, which may require only 1-3 days of plasma infusion . Patients with cTTP may have complete resolution of symptoms after plasma infusion . Chronic treatment . Patients with cTTP with ongoing TTP activity may need to be maintained on prophylactic plasma infusions to prevent persistent TMA findings and treat symptoms . Prophylactic therapy with plasma infusions is often a lifetime commitment . This therapy is appropriate to continue if patients benefit from improved symptoms after plasma infusion . Therefore, offering patients the alternative of close monitoring for symptoms without treatment is sometimes appropriate . These patients may avoid the time commitment and potential complications associated with long-term plasma infusion therapy . Even if the platelet count is above 150 x 10 /L, individuals may still have symptoms attributed to TTP that resolve with treatment with plasma infusions . Patients should be immediately started on plasma infusion therapy if they experience unexplained neurological findings or thrombocytopenia . These treatments should continue biweekly for 6 weeks postpartum . Recombinant ADAMTS13 therapy . 
If the disease did not significantly improve with these simple treatments, then more potent DMARDs were added . It is now clear, however, that effective therapy early in the course of RA results in a long-term reduction in joint damage compared to delayed therapy, the so-called window of opportunity . The currently approved non-biological drugs for treating RA are listed in Table 8.1 . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . NSAIDs remain one of the most frequently prescribed class of drugs in the treatment of patients with RA, at least early in the disease process . They are rarely, if ever, treatment for RA in isolation and without DMARD therapy . Corticosteroids have a long history in the treatment of many rheumatic diseases and they are still a key element in the management of RA . Therapy is often initiated in patients with active disease while awaiting the full therapeutic effect of DMARDs . Recent clinical trials have confirmed the ability of corticosteroids to rapidly control inflammation in patients with recent-onset RA when used in combination with DMARD therapy . Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs . All patients with RA are candidates for DMARD therapy, initiated at the time of diagnosis . When used as monotherapy they may only moderate the disease process, without completely suppressing inflammation . In this way inflammation is effectively suppressed, regardless of the drugs used to achieve it, with minimization of joint damage . It may be possible to taper one or more elements of a combination regimen once disease is in clinical remission (step-down therapy) . NICE guidance for the management of early RA is shown in Table 8.3 . Hydroxychloroquine (200-400 mg daily) is often used in early mild disease and as background therapy when another DMARD is started . This is extremely rare with hydroxychloroquine, but it is recommended that patients undergo an ophthalmology examination before starting therapy and at intervals thereafter . Methotrexate has become the most commonly used DMARD for RA as a result of its favorable efficacy/toxicity profile and low cost . More than 50% of patients taking methotrexate continue the drug for more than 5 years, which is longer than for any other DMARD . Despite its effectiveness, the precise mechanism of action of methotrexate in RA remains uncertain . Contraindications and monitoring . Use of methotrexate in patients with renal insufficiency or on dialysis should be avoided . Guidelines for monitoring patients with RA while on methotrexate have been established by a number of bodies . It is frequently used in combination with other DMARDs . Leflunomide is a further DMARD with immunomodulatory properties . Leflunomide therefore has inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation . Gold compounds, because of their effectiveness in suppressing synovitis, were the most popular disease-modifying agents in the 1970s and early 1980s . An initial test dose of 10 mg should be administered before starting weekly therapy at 50 mg . The dosing interval can be increased once an effect is established . In RA it is effective as monotherapy and as an adjunct to methotrexate . Cytotoxic drugs, including azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, are generally reserved for patients with refractory RA who have failed conventional therapy . The optimal timing of, and potential benefit to be gained from, orthopedic surgery in the RA patient requires skilled judgment . Similarly, both local and systemic disease activity must be optimally controlled perioperatively . Rheumatologists today initiate disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy as soon as the diagnosis of RA is secure . Subsequently, therapy is aggressively adjusted until a state of low disease activity or remission is achieved . Early control of inflammation and the disease process is essential to minimize irreversible joint damage and functional disability . Most patients will commence therapy with methotrexate, either alone or ideally in combination with other DMARDs . With aggressive DMARD therapy a proportion of patients will achieve disease remission, and those who do not can now receive biological therapies (see Chapter 9) within a few months of diagnosis . The patient must be fully educated about treatment options and expectations from the outset, and decisions regarding drug therapy must be mutually agreed . Furthermore, the rheumatologist must serve as an advocate for the patient with regard to treatment and drug monitoring programs . 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and underrecognized . In the UK, 9% of the population (approximately 2 million individuals) have CKD stages 1-4 with about 20000 patients on dialysis . The incidence of CKD leading to dialysis varies worldwide; the number of patients per million population starting dialysis each year is 300 in the USA compared with 230 in Japan and 110 in the UK . The three most important causes of CKD are diabetes, glomerulonephritis and hypertension (and other vascular disease), but the primary cause does vary geographically (Figure 4.1) . CKD usually presents with non-specific symptoms caused by kidney failure and the underlying disease, or is discovered by chance following a routine blood or urine test . Recognition of abnormal kidney function is the key to the diagnosis of CKD . CKD is generally a progressive disease (Figure 4.2), though the rate of decline in kidney function varies between patients . blood pressure . The management of CKD is summarized in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 . Combining both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB is no longer recommended for most patients . For patients on dialysis, the most important factor in controlling blood pressure is to control salt (and water) intake and body fluid volume . A full discussion of hypertension and kidney disease can be found in Chapter 5 . Patients should also be vaccinated against hepatitis B early in CKD, when the immune response is better preserved . CKD leads to a variety of complications, which can all cause considerable morbidity (Table 4.4) . One of the major aims of care in patients with CKD is to minimize these complications, even if the underlying renal disease cannot be treated . Many complications are common to both CKD and patients established on dialysis . There is a strong association between anemia and risk of death in ESKD, and an association with increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD . Preventing blood transfusions, especially in patients who are candidates for kidney transplantation, is an acceptable reason for ESA treatment . Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with CKD, and cardiovascular mortality is doubled in patients with a GFR below 70 mL/minute (id est quite moderate renal impairment) . The risk factors for cardiovascular disease in CKD are summarized in Table 4.6; the risks increase as kidney function deteriorates . Table 4.7 provides guidelines for reducing the risk of cardiovascular complications . In general, the management of cardiovascular disease is similar in patients with and without kidney disease . Patients with CKD undergoing angiography should be protected from contrast nephropathy by hydration . Hypertension can be both a cause and consequence of kidney disease, and uncontrolled hypertension is the most important factor contributing to the rate of progression of kidney damage, whatever the original cause (see Chapter 5) . Metabolic bone disease . A number of factors contribute to metabolic bone disease (Table 4.8) . Symptoms of metabolic bone disease include pruritus and bone and joint pain . (Historically, aluminum salts were given, until it was recognized that aluminum itself caused neurological damage, anemia and bone disease . Some patients require parathyroidectomy if all else fails . Dialysis amyloid is a complication that affects all patients who have been on dialysis for over 20 years . Dialysis amyloid can be treated only by kidney transplantation, and symptoms and signs may take years to abate; other treatments are palliative . Patients with ESKD are often almost anuric and must therefore watch their fluid intake carefully . This is particularly a problem for patients on hemodialysis . Fluid overload can lead to pulmonary edema, peripheral edema and hypertension . Malnutrition is a particularly important problem in ESKD, and affects 40-50% of patients (Table 4.9) . Sexual, psychological and social complications . Sexual dysfunction is extremely common in patients with CKD . Treatment involves high-quality dialysis and psychological or pharmacological interventions as appropriate . The side effects of psychotropic drugs are often increased in kidney failure . Social support is therefore immensely important and increases survival . The epidemic of chronic kidney disease . Much of this CKD is due to type 2 diabetes and to hypertension, but there are also unknown causes of kidney failure . 
Standard treatment . induction chemotherapy to remove the majority of malignant cells and restore normal hematopoiesis, followed, once remission is achieved, by . Standard induction chemotherapy . CR is achieved 4-5 weeks after initiating induction chemotherapy in 60-70% of patients . However, all patients require some form of consolidation therapy following achievement of CR to prevent disease recurrence . The definition of CR is further defined based on the detection of residual disease by cytogenetic or molecular testing . Use of alternative anthracyclines . Idarubicin has a potentially superior pharmacokinetic profile to daunorubicin . High-dose AraC for induction . Newly approved drugs . After more than three decades with virtually no new agents, four new treatments were recently approved (Table 3.1) . Midostaurin and enasidenib in particular highlight the value and potential for genetic testing in AML . Below are summarized new agents for initial therapy: midostaurin, CPX-351, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin . However, clinical trials continued and the safety concerns were overcome . Further studies explored GO at a lower dose and with fractionated administration, alone and in combination with chemotherapy . Clinical trials with GO in a different patient population were also successful . Maintenance therapy was permitted in the GO arm at 2 mg/m monthly . Standard consolidation therapy (following intensive induction) . Detectable residual cells are referred to as measurable residual disease (MRD; formerly minimal residual disease) . For patients who achieve first CR (CR1) following intensive induction chemotherapy, the options for consolidation therapy are . intensive high-dose (non-myeloablative) chemotherapy . allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) . autologous HCT (autoHCT) . Intensive (non-myeloablative) consolidation chemotherapy . Guidelines for dosing of consolidation chemotherapy are provided by European LeukemiaNet . However, two other studies failed to show an advantage of alloHCT over chemotherapy or autoHCT . In all the studies, the outcome with chemotherapy or autoHCT alone was dismal . If an HLA-identical donor is available, other parameters can be used to guide the decision-making process . Factors that favor alloHCT in CR1 are shown in Table 3.4 . Notably, the outcomes with alloHCT are profoundly affected by disease burden at the time of the procedure . Role of consolidation chemotherapy before alloHCT . Another retrospective analysis from a single center showed similar findings and suggested that multiple courses of chemotherapy before alloHCT had a deleterious effect . Bone marrow versus peripheral blood stem cells . Use of bone marrow is associated with a lower risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease . Treatment selection . This group is heterogeneous in their response to therapy and most have a normal karyotype . Induction in older and physically 'unfit' patients . Clearly, outcomes with all such treatments remain very poor; clinical trials should be recommended . Induction chemotherapy fails to induce remission in a proportion of patients . The prognosis of these patients remains poor despite salvage chemotherapy and alloHCT . Intensive salvage chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation . The optimal salvage regimen has yet to be defined, and where possible, patients should be encouraged to enroll on a clinical trial . The drug, given once daily, was well tolerated, allowing it to be administered largely in the outpatient setting . Median OS was 19.7 months in patients who achieved CR . In AML, mutations in IDH1 occur slightly less frequently than in IDH2 and may also be targeted by similar compounds . Patients received 3 mg/m² GO monotherapy on days 1, 4 and 7 . Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia . It is characterized by fever, fluid retention, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusion, and hypoxemia . Temporary discontinuation of ATRA is necessary in severe cases (id est respiratory distress and renal failure) . ATO monotherapy for induction is effective and has been studied in areas of the developing world without access to ATRA . 
The eyes may be affected by certain systemic diseases or medications . Eye problems may even be the first presentation of a systemic disease or a drug's side effect . This chapter summarizes the medical conditions and systemic medications most likely to affect the eyes . The best time to detect and treat serious diabetic retinopathy is before the patient develops blurred vision . Abnormal new blood vessels grow from the optic disc or retinal veins into the vitreous jelly (Figure 8.3), and can cause blindness from severe vitreous hemorrhage or by causing traction retinal detachment . Hypertensive retinopathy . Hypertensive patients do not require specific eye screening for this condition in the way that diabetic patients do . Although the presence of hypertensive retinopathy is a useful indication that marked hypertension has been present for some time, it does not usually cause vision problems in itself . Systemic medication and the eye . When patients present with an eye problem that has no apparent cause, it is worth considering whether the condition could be caused by a systemic medication they are taking . Alpha-blockers (doxazosin and tamsulosin) are used to treat blood pressure and prostatic symptoms . Amiodarone commonly causes vortex keratopathy (a whorl-like pattern on the surface of the cornea) . The corneal changes are usually asymptomatic but, rarely, the drug can cause optic neuropathy . Referral is indicated if vision is affected . Tricyclic antidepressants (exempli gratia amitriptyline) may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil and blocking the draining of aqueous humor in the eye . Symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma include severe eye pain and headache, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision and colored haloes around bright lights (see Fast Facts: Glaucoma) . Amitriptyline can also cause dry eye and difficulty with focusing . Amphetamines may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil . Catecholamines (adrenaline/noradrenaline, ephedrine) may cause pupillary dilation and angle closure glaucoma . Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . They are also used to prevent and treat malaria . Digitalis/digoxin can cause glare symptoms, and some patients taking this medication see haloes around light . Over-dosage can cause vision to become yellowish . These patients should be referred for evaluation of digoxin blood levels . Ethambutol and/or isoniazid is an antituberculosis (anti-TB) medication that may cause optic nerve toxicity .

Blood tests . Apart from CK, these tests will be normal or negative in ALS . Moderate rises in CK (up to 500 U/L) are common in ALS due to denervation, but CK levels are also frequently normal . NCS may be normal in ALS, whereas EMG is not (except in the distinct, pure UMN disorder, primary lateral sclerosis) . However, any abnormal EMG findings are not specific for ALS . ALS is a pure motor syndrome . The nerves typically tested are the median, ulnar, peroneal, tibial and sural nerves, but more uncommonly tested nerves may also be studied if clinically indicated . In ALS, these tests are primarily performed to exclude demyelination and to confirm normal sensory function . As such, they may be normal . In ALS, there should be no evidence of primary demyelination . MMN is the main differential diagnosis in individuals who present with a pure motor syndrome in the arm . Sensory nerve conduction studies should be normal . As such, minor abnormalities of sensory NCS do not exclude the diagnosis of ALS . The core aims of EMG in ALS are to . confirm LMN pathology where clinical signs are equivocal . The abnormalities seen on EMG are not specific for ALS; any cause of denervation will result in the same findings . Conversely, as EMG is operator dependent, if the clinical history and examination indicate ALS, then a lack of typical EMG changes should not delay the formal diagnosis . Abnormal spontaneous activity . Normal resting muscle shows no spontaneous activity, so spontaneous activity indicates muscle membrane instability, including inflammation of the muscle (myositis) and denervation . They arise because of spontaneous discharge of a single motor unit, and their configuration on EMG is therefore that of the motor unit discharging . Abnormalities on voluntary activation . The presence of chronic denervation and reinnervation is determined with the individual gently activating the muscle being tested . This results in increased variability of the configuration of the compound MUP . In healthy individuals, increasing the force of muscle contraction is achieved by activating, or recruiting, more motor units . After denervation, fewer motor units are available, so attempts to increase the force of contraction result in more rapid firing of the few remaining motor units . These include motor unit number estimation and motor unit number index . It is primarily performed to exclude alternative diagnoses . Conventional MRI is typically normal in ALS . It is not uncommon for individuals who are subsequently diagnosed with ALS to have undergone surgery for degenerative spinal disease that is later determined to have been irrelevant to their presentation . Individuals with nerve compression typically have radicular pain and sensory symptoms . Lumbar puncture is not routinely necessary in individuals with suspected ALS . Genotyping is becoming a more frequent issue in ALS case stratification . A consistent definition of familial ALS, as for many conditions, is challenging . Muscle biopsy . Muscle biopsy should not be routinely performed for suspected ALS . If a muscle biopsy is performed in ALS, the histopathological findings will be non-specific and consistent with chronic denervation and reinnervation . All cases require a consistent history and examination to support the diagnosis of ALS and appropriate investigations to exclude alternative diagnoses . With this addition, an individual originally diagnosed as having 'possible' ALS, who would have been excluded from most clinical trials, could be reclassified as having laboratory-supported clinically probable ALS, often becoming eligible for trial inclusion as a result . The reclassification was made if the individual had EMG evidence of active denervation with compensatory chronic reinnervation in a body segment that did not have LMN signs on clinical examination . Hence, the separate category of laboratory-supported clinically probable ALS was removed, and individuals were categorized as definite, probable or possible according to the presence of LMN pathology, determined by either clinical examination or EMG . The different categories do not reflect a clinical spectrum of disease progression . Individuals do not follow a clinical course that evolves from possible to definite and they may die from the disease having never progressed from the category of 'possible ALS' . The concept of possible, probable and definite ALS is therefore not helpful in explaining the diagnosis to individuals and does not predict their disease trajectory . These terms should therefore be avoided when counseling symptomatic individuals . 
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a group of disorders of diverse etiology (Table 6.1) and presents as a spectrum of disease ranging from apparently innocuous deposition of fat in the liver to cirrhosis with liver failure . Once thought to be uncommon and benign, NAFLD is now recognized as one of the most common forms of serious liver disease in Western populations . The liver cells swell and are surrounded by inflammatory cells . The pathogenesis of NAFLD is incompletely understood . Clinical presentation and diagnosis . Most patients with the early stages of NAFLD have few symptoms and are typically first identified by abnormal liver tests on routine screening . As there is no specific laboratory test for NAFLD, most practitioners make a tentative diagnosis by excluding other causes of liver disease . The possibility of drug-induced liver disease warrants attention, given that many patients take a variety of medications for disorders associated with NAFLD (diabetes, obesity and hyperlipidemia), and some of these medications have been reported to cause hepatic injury . Without a definitive method to quantify alcohol intake accurately, separating alcoholic liver disease (ALD) from NAFLD remains problematic; histologically, they may be indistinguishable . There is currently no consensus on which patients require a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of NAFLD . The natural history of NAFLD is incompletely defined . Many patients have an uneventful course; however, some will advance to end-stage liver disease and are vulnerable to all the complications of cirrhosis . Weight reduction is the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD . Hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron overload . Genetic mutations associated with hemochromatosis result in altered regulation of iron absorption . Clinical presentation . Often, abnormal iron levels are the only indication of the disease . Liver functional parameters are non-specific and reflect the severity of liver dysfunction . Transferrin saturation is a better diagnostic tool than ferritin concentration, which is often elevated in inflammatory conditions and non-hemochromatosis liver disorders . Mutations in this gene are associated with hemochromatosis, and blood tests for the gene are commercially available . The most common mutation is cysteine to tyrosine at residue 282 (C282Y mutation) and is seen in most patients with the disease . Patients who are heterozygous for the C282Y mutation typically do not develop pathological iron overload . It is important to recognize that not all patients with hemochromatosis have typical mutations . Similarly, not all patients with typical mutations will develop pathological iron overload - the penetration of the mutations is not yet fully understood . A hepatic iron index, calculated by dividing the hepatic iron concentration by the patient's age, is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of the disorder . In general, it is recommended that patients with abnormal liver blood tests or other signs of liver disease undergo liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the presence and severity of fibrosis . Patients with hemochromatosis, particularly men with fibrotic disease, are at significant risk for hepatocellular carcinoma . Screening for hemochromatosis . Because hemochromatosis is an easily treatable autosomal dominant disorder but has potentially devastating consequences, screening for the disorder is appealing . Close relatives of patients identified with hemochromatosis should be screened by measuring transferrin saturation and genetic markers . The disorder is uncommon (1 in 30 000) and affects all races . Symptoms and signs of Wilson's disease typically develop in older children and young adults, although in a few patients the disease is not discovered until the fifth or sixth decade . Younger patients usually present with hepatic dysfunction, whereas neuropsychiatric manifestations dominate the presentation of older patients . All young patients with abnormal liver tests, signs of liver disease or any unexplained neuropsychiatric disorder deserve investigation . alpha antitrypsin deficiency (ATD) is a well-known cause of chronic lung disease . It is also associated with liver disease in children and adults . Although ATD is not rare (it affects approximately 1 in 1800 births), only a small percentage of patients with ATD will develop liver disease . There is no specific treatment for ATD liver disease . Transplant is an option for patients with advanced liver disease provided their lungs have not been too severely affected . 
Type 1 diabetes afflicts millions of people worldwide . Type 1a is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that cause immune destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans; in type 1b diabetes, such evidence is lacking . The hallmark of type 1 diabetes mellitus (also known, historically, as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) is insulin deficiency . Loss of normal insulin secretion from the endocrine pancreas is caused by progressive destruction of the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans . The classic symptoms of diabetes (Table 3.1) emerge when approximately 90% of the beta cells in the islets have been destroyed . Type 1 diabetes differs from type 2 in many ways; the key features of type 1 diabetes are illustrated in Table 3.2 . Testing for autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes and insulin secretory reserve helps to distinguish the two conditions . Children who develop type 1 diabetes are often heavier in early childhood and tend to be taller . Mumps and Coxsackie viruses may cause acute pancreatitis and Coxsackie virus infection may lead to inflammatory destruction of beta cells . A significant association between enterovirus infection detected by molecular methods and autoimmune type 1 diabetes has been demonstrated . Coxsackie B viruses have been isolated from the pancreases of patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes . Viruses (such as Coxsackie) may directly attack the beta cell or may act by initiating autoimmune destruction of the beta cell . The only certain association is between rubella infection during pregnancy and increased risk of the neonate developing type 1 diabetes . Type 1 diabetes is a complex genetic trait . The concordance for type 1 diabetes is approximately 30-50% for monozygotic or identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) . Many studies have evaluated candidate genes for disease association, leading to the identification of two chromosomal regions with consistent and significant association with type 1 diabetes . Indeed, approximately 30% of patients with type 1 diabetes are HLA-DQ2/DQ8 heterozygotes . The insulin gene is a very plausible candidate susceptibility locus, as insulin may act as an autoantigen in the immune-mediated process leading to type 1 diabetes . Other susceptibility loci have been identified in certain groups of people with type 1 diabetes . Mechanisms of autoimmune beta cell destruction . Insulitis is deemed to be the precursor of the process of progressive beta cell destruction . Immune destruction of beta cells . Much of our understanding of the mechanism of beta cell destruction has come from studies not in humans but in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and biobreeding (BB) rat, with the former now being the favored model of type 1 diabetes . Insulitis is associated with the presence of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and macrophages, suggesting that these cells play an important role in the destruction of beta cells . We know that the destructive process is very specific to beta cells, with alpha cells being left intact . In response to this, T cells are activated and divide into two T helper subsets, termed Th1 and Th2 . Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor beta . Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 . Such cytokines have been shown to exert toxic effects on the beta cell and to inhibit insulin secretion . Th2 cells are responsible for B cell helper function, resulting in the production of the aforementioned antibodies directed against both the cytoplasmic components of islet cells and islet cell constituents . Experimental manipulation to prevent T cell responses in animal studies can also prevent the emergence of diabetes . Some individuals may develop the autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes but not go on to develop the disease; persistence of ICA, however, is associated with progressive beta cell destruction and the emergence of clinical type 1 diabetes . Loss of beta cell mass . The autoimmune process in type 1 diabetes is associated with a decline in beta cell mass . Once beta cell destruction is advanced, C-peptide levels become undetectable although, as mentioned previously, C-peptide levels may be detectable in some patients for several months after the clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes . Hyperglycemia produces the classic symptoms with which people with type 1 diabetes present . 
Etiology and pathogenesis . Stones within the common bile duct (CBD) are usually formed in the gallbladder and pass on to the CBD . They may be of the cholesterol or hard black-pigmented type (see Chapter 3) . However, primary stones formed within the bile duct are commonly of the soft brown-pigmented type; they are promoted by stasis . Cholangitis can occur concurrently with choledocholithiasis; it may be acute or chronic and is caused by at least partial obstruction to bile flow . Epidemiology and risk factors . The exact prevalence and incidence of bile duct stones is not known . Symptoms and signs include right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, jaundice, fever, clay-colored stools and dark urine . Patients with severe or suppurative cholangitis are severely ill, with septicemia, shock and mental confusion . Leukocytosis is seen in patients with cholangitis . Increased amylase or lipase are present in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis . Transabdominal ultrasound is non-invasive and is generally the first imaging modality used when a stone in the CBD is suspected . Its sensitivity for detection of a dilated bile duct is up to 90%, and even higher in jaundiced patients . It can be performed in a combined session with therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to achieve diagnosis and stone removal . Contraindications include claustrophobia and implanted metal devices and fragments . MRCP is a useful, non-invasive and reliable test for CBD stones . MRCP and EUS generally have comparable high accuracy; however, for small stones less than 6 mm in diameter, EUS may be more accurate . Computed tomography cholangiography involves imaging the biliary ductal system after injection of contrast medium . The accuracy for CBD stones is around 85%, less than for EUS and MRCP . Intraductal ultrasound during ERCP has a similar accuracy and is marginally superior to ERCP alone . These diagnostic ERCP techniques are invasive and should generally not be used in preference to conventional EUS or MRCP . Intraoperative cholangiography is performed at the time of cholecystectomy to detect the presence of CBD stones . It is performed routinely at some institutions, whereas others perform it when there is suspicion of retained CBD stones . Choosing the right diagnostic test . Suspected choledocholithiasis and intact gallbladder . If the preliminary examination proves negative then a cholecystectomy may be undertaken with the option of performing an intraoperative cholangiogram . Suspected choledocholithiasis after cholecystectomy . Medical treatment . Thus, the prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio need to be checked in all patients . Fresh frozen plasma may be required to correct clotting immediately . All patients with abnormal clotting parameters will need vitamin supplementation by parenteral injection and/or absorbable modified vitamin K by mouth . Treatment with intravenous fluids and antibiotics may have to be supplemented by intensive care and vasopressors in severe or suppurative cholangitis . Endoscopic treatment . Endoscopic biliary decompression by ERCP with sphincterotomy allows endoscopic extraction of stones from the CBD . Alternative radiological and surgical methods for biliary decompression in acutely ill patients with biliary obstruction should be readily available . Surgical treatment . This is, however, a rare event in high volume ERCP centers . Another indication for surgical CBD exploration includes stones discovered during intraoperative cholangiography . This approach is successful in clearing CBD stones in more then 90% of cases . Open CBD procedures are rarely performed any more but may occasionally be required when other non-surgical or laparoscopic methods are unsuccessful or impossible . Future trends . Future developments are likely to include . more widespread application of non-invasive and minimally invasive imaging with MRCP and EUS . development of video cholangioscopy leading to direct and easy visualization of the bile duct for diagnosis and therapy . 
Patients may have no cardiac symptoms at all (exempli gratia with atrial fibrillation [AF] after a stroke, or as a finding at screening) . Alternatively, patients may present with sudden cardiac death as their first symptom, usually as a result of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, and they may be resuscitated from a cardiac arrest, often out of hospital . There are often few or no physical signs, and although cardiovascular examination may be normal, this does not rule out a cardiac cause . Patients with chest pain, rhythm disturbance or murmurs need further investigation . Palpitations are common in patients with any cardiac arrhythmia . When interviewing a patient with palpitations, it is important to determine whether the palpitations represent abnormal awareness of a normal heart beat or an actual cardiac rhythm disturbance (id est normal awareness of an abnormal beat) . Try to get patients to be as clear as possible in their description, and ask them to tap out what they feel their heart is actually doing . Table 2.1 highlights some of the key questions to ask patients to help with the diagnosis . Palpitation is the baseline symptom for all arrhythmias, but there are few specific symptoms that differentiate one rhythm from another . The occurrence of other symptoms depends on factors such as the patient's premorbid fitness level and the presence or absence of underlying cardiac disease . For example, a 20-year-old with atrial arrhythmia or supraventricular tachycardia may not have many symptoms other than palpitations, whereas a 60-year-old with mitral stenosis or regurgitation may have severe symptoms such as shortness of breath or even pulmonary edema . Sometimes patients will notice that their palpitations feel irregular, suggesting AF, but this is not a consistent or reliable observation and it can be difficult to determine whether or not the heart is regular at fast rates . Ectopics arise through firing of ventricular or atrial foci and the symptoms often have three components . 'the early beat' - the ectopic itself . Although the sensation is abnormal, some patients do not notice the ectopic itself because of the reduced filling time and reduced stroke volume . Usually, the more frequent the ectopics, the more likely the patient is to notice . Symptoms are more common with ventricular ectopics, which are associated with a greater disturbance to hemodynamic function . Although the majority of symptomatic patients experience (normal) occasional ectopics that are generally benign, ectopics may also be associated with an adverse prognosis . Knowledge of whether the patient has structural heart disease is crucial in risk stratification . If the patient has structural heart disease, the presence of ventricular ectopics may require further cardiological investigation . Although many patients seem to notice every abnormal heart beat, other patients never notice any change in their heart rhythm . Persistent tachycardias may also produce symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue because of hemodynamic compromise . Cardiac syncope is usually characterized by sudden and complete loss of consciousness for less than 1-2 minutes . This is a subjective symptom . It is not often reliably associated with cardiac pathology . However, pain is not usually an accepted feature of an arrhythmia . If the patient complains of pain, then other conditions should be considered, such as associated angina . It is common for anxious patients to complain of a sharp, left inframammary stabbing pain, but this is often innocuous . Clinical heart failure may indicate significant LV dysfunction or valvular heart disease . Arrhythmias can be fatal at initial presentation or after persistent episodes . Symptomatic patients are evaluated to determine any concerns regarding possible cardiac arrhythmias . When symptoms are prominent, or if patients have an abnormal electrocardiogram, such as showing pre-excitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), or if patients have underlying heart disease, an evaluation in the arrhythmia clinic should be obtained . Asymptomatic patients . Arrhythmias are usually treated because symptoms interfere with a patient's quality of life . In certain situations it is crucial to know if treatment is warranted because of an adverse prognosis even if the patient is asymptomatic (Table 2.2) . 
Treatment of comedones and macrocomedones . Acne surgery involves expressing the contents of closed comedones in an effort to speed the resolution of acne . There is a risk of increasing the inflammation associated with acne if the contents of the comedone are extruded into the dermis, rather than onto the surface of the skin . With the advent of effective topical retinoids, this procedure is used much less often . Light electrocautery . Macrocomedones are large comedones that are often resistant to treatment with topical retinoids and oral isotretinoin . Sun exposure is reported to have a beneficial effect in up to 70% of patients with acne . However, the effects are short-lived, and clearly the potential risk of skin malignancies negates the possible short-term improvement that ultraviolet (UV) light might induce in acne . Visible light treatment has the advantage of avoiding the potential risks of UV radiation . acnes) is known to produce endogenous porphyrins, which absorb visible light at 415 nm and could therefore produce a photodynamic reaction following irradiation with blue light . Red light is able to penetrate the tissue more deeply than blue light and has anti-inflammatory activity . A recent review has assessed the effects and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of acne: 492 patients from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated . Light sources included red light, intense pulsed light (IPL), pulsed dye laser (PDL), long-pulsed dye laser (LPDL) and green light . Many combinations of light sources and photosensitizers have produced positive results in patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions; in some cases, these treatments have also reduced sebum production . However, the evidence for PDT as a good treatment option for acne, producing positive results with acceptable side effects, is limited . ALA plus red light seems to be the optimal choice . Treatment of inflammatory nodules/cysts . Often a volume of 0.05-0.25 mL per lesion is used . This mode of therapy is a useful adjuvant to treatment with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin . It is particularly helpful in patients who develop these lesions only rarely and who are not candidates for treatment with isotretinoin . Management of scars . Patients with a family history of scarring acne may be at increased risk of developing acne scars . Hypertrophic and keloidal scars occur most often on the chest and back of young patients with severe cystic acne . The best solution to the problem of acne scarring is to institute appropriate therapy early in the course of acne to avoid this complication . Referral to a dermatologist should be considered for a consultation regarding the possible use of intralesional injection with triamcinolone, treatment with silicone gel sheeting or laser therapy . Acne scars that are erythematous may respond to treatment with a pulsed-dye laser, which reduces the erythema of the scar . The treatment of atrophic acne scars is based on type, distribution and depth . Deep scars should be treated singularly in order to make them superficial . Appropriate techniques include fillers, subcision, punch elevation, punch grafting, surgery and chemical reconstruction of skin scars (CROSS), a method that uses a high concentration of trichloroacetic acid localized on the depth of a single scar . The first dermal filler for acne scars has now been approved by the FDA . Comprised of 80% purified bovine collagen and 20% polymethylmethacrylate microspheres, it is indicated for the correction of moderate-to-severe atrophic facial acne scars on the cheeks in patients over 21 years of age . It has been shown to add volume to the skin and lift and smooth pitted acne scars to the level of the surrounding areas . Superficial and widely distributed scars may benefit from laser therapy, peelings, dermarolling and dermabrasion . Punch grafting is a useful technique wherein the scar is removed with a punch excision . CO laser abrasion and peelings should be used only after the patient's acne is no longer active . At present, a waiting period of 6 months following treatment with isotretinoin is recommended before proceeding; otherwise, patients can develop significant postinflammatory pigmentation . 
Primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders . The immunophenotype for LyP is generally CD3+, CD4+, CD8-/+, CD30+ . CD5, CD7, CD15, CD26, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) are negative . Histopathology shows a wedge-shaped infiltrate of large, atypical, anaplastic CD4+, CD30+ T cells, sometimes with morphological similarities to Reed-Sternberg cells . Epidermotropism may or may not be present . Type B (mycosis fungoides-like) . Epidermotropism is also usually present . Type C (ALCL-like), like type A, is characterized by large, atypical, anaplastic CD30+ T cells with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate . Clinical correlation is necessary for a definitive diagnosis (Figure 4.3) . Type D (cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma-like) is characterized by CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD30+ markedly epidermotropic cerebriform T cells with a lichenoid or wedge-shaped dermal infiltrate (Figure 4.4) . However, CD30+ is generally not seen in either of these differential diagnoses, so demonstration of CD30+ T cells with clinical correlation is crucial for diagnosis of this histological mimic . The histopathology shows small, cerebriform T cells in the epidermis with larger, atypical, anaplastic CD30+/- T cells in the dermis . Like LyP, the immunophenotype of PC-ALCL is generally CD3+/-, CD4+, CD8-, CD30+, with loss of CD5 and CD7 . MF with CD30+ large cell transformation is also composed of CD30+ T cells (see Table 4.2) . Histologically, PC-ALCL is generally EMA and ALK-1 negative compared with systemic disease . Primary cutaneous small/medium CD4+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder . An admixture of reactive B cells is common . Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma . Primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma . However, the clinical course of primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma is much worse . The infiltrates are characterized by a dense, nodular to diffuse pattern of medium- to large-sized pleomorphic cells (Figure 4.13) . Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma (Berti's lymphoma) . This cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma is characterized by marked epidermotropism of atypical CD8+ T cells (Figure 4.15) . The immunophenotype is CD3+, CD4-, CD7+, CD8+, TIA-1+, CD45RA+, CD45RO-, CD56-, EBER-, betaF1+ (Figure 4.17) . Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type . This malignancy is a cytotoxic systemic lymphoma with common cutaneous involvement . Histology shows a dense, diffuse, dermal to subcutaneous infiltrate of large, pleomorphic neoplastic cells . The immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells is CD2+, CD56+, TIA-1+ . EBER1+, but CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD57, betaF1 and TCR-gamma are routinely negative . As this is a cytotoxic lymphoma, complete systemic work-up is necessary . Cutaneous adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . Immunophenotyping reveals a T-helper profile of CD3+, CD4+, CD8- as well as a T-regulatory phenotype with FOX-P3+ expression . CD25 is also characteristically expressed in ATLL, but is not diagnostic . The histopathology varies with the clinical presentation . The neoplastic cells show a T-follicular helper cell phenotype with expression of PD-1 and CXCL-13 most specifically (Figure 4.19) . Characteristically, the neoplastic cells are CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD56+, CD123+, TCL1+ . 
Phototherapy involves whole-body exposure to artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and is being widely and increasingly used for the treatment of extensive psoriasis resistant to topical therapy . UVB radiation is absorbed mainly by the epidermis and is an effective treatment for psoriasis . A meticulous record of the total cumulative UV dose for each patient is kept to avoid excessive exposure . To achieve clearance, patients receive treatment two or three times a week for 3-10 weeks, depending on disease response . In general, phototherapy is very well tolerated and is viewed by patients as an escape from the problems of topical agents . Elderly patients may not tolerate standing in the warm enclosed environment of the phototherapy cabinet for prolonged exposure times . Short-term risks . Narrow-band UVB may be less likely to produce burning than broad-band UVB, though both are probably associated with a long-term risk of skin cancer . Long-term risks . As with any form of chronic UV exposure, it is likely that phototherapy carries an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, which increases with cumulative exposure . Broad-band UVB is probably associated with a small increase in the risk of squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in patients receiving high-level exposure (more than 300 treatments) . Home phototherapy . Although phototherapy is a popular and effective treatment for psoriasis, a significant number of patients find the repeated journeys to the hospital and/or clinic for multiple treatment sessions inconvenient and also expensive . Short-term risks . Nausea and vomiting secondary to the ingestion of the sensitizing drug occurs in 10-20% of patients . Pruritus is often seen after the first two or three treatments, and may be reduced by adjusting the dose of both the drug and UVA . Adequate use of emollients after and between phototherapy treatments will also help to reduce the inevitable drying effect . Current recommendations for all patients receiving oral PUVA therapy include wearing photoprotective UVA-screening glasses for 24 hours following treatment . Fortunately, retrospective surveys have not shown an increased risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts in patients receiving extensive PUVA, provided such safety precautions have been taken . Long-term risks of PUVA are significant . Premature aging of the skin, together with thinning and bruising, occurs in patients with light skin (types I or II) who have received high-dose PUVA (multiple courses over years of therapy) . The amount of freckling usually correlates with the number of treatments . Skin cancer . Increased numbers of premalignant lesions (actinic keratoses) have been noted in patients with skin types I and II . To reduce the overall risk of skin cancer, PUVA is often combined with systemic retinoids or topical therapy, such as vitamin D and vitamin A derivatives, so that fewer treatments are needed and the cumulative UVA dose is reduced . As with phototherapy, PUVA is relatively contraindicated in patients who already have risk factors for skin cancer . It should therefore be prescribed for these patients only with extreme caution . Monitoring the UVA cabinet . Patient safety . During UVA exposure, the patient should wear underwear to protect the genitals . All patients should receive regular twice-yearly total-body skin examinations to check for occult malignancies . The dose of methoxsalen is based on the patient's weight; the most effective dose is 0.3-0.4 mg/kg . Patients with skin type I (always burns, never tans) require lower doses than patients with types V or VI (moderately or heavily pigmented skin) . Patients are usually treated twice a week . The patient soaks in water containing measured amounts of the sensitizing drug before UVA exposure . PUVA is indicated for patients with psoriasis resistant to topical therapies or with moderate-to-severe psoriasis affecting more than 10% of the body surface area . Caution must be exercised in patients with inflammatory psoriasis . PUVA is contraindicated for patients who . have a history of skin cancer, particularly malignant melanoma . PUVA is extremely effective in most cases, and especially in patients with chronic stable plaque forms of psoriasis involving the trunk and limbs . Remission rates with PUVA are superior to almost all other forms of therapy, including systemic treatments . 
Metabolic syndrome . This definition takes account of the fact that central adiposity is common to each component of the metabolic syndrome . The criteria are summarized in Table 3.1 . According to some estimates, as many as 75 million people in the USA alone may exhibit the syndrome . Others suggest that as few as 30% of adults exhibit none of the major characteristics of metabolic syndrome . Insulin resistance is the common denominator for all the risk factors for metabolic syndrome . Effects of insulin resistance on other organs . Typically, 10% weight loss will result in . 50% reduction in fasting glucose . 15% reduction in HbA 1c . 15% reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) . 30% reduction in triglycerides . 10 mmHg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure . The lowest mortalities occur in people who are normal weight or overweight and remain weight stable . For people who are overweight, gaining more weight increases mortality . Diabetes mellitus . abdominal rather than peripheral obesity (see Figure 3.1) . a family history of diabetes . gestational diabetes (and those whose mothers had gestational diabetes) . a history of excessive childhood weight gain . Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease . Once complications are established very tight control is less beneficial . Also see Fast Facts: Diabetes Mellitus . Weight loss . Regular and ongoing physical activity and a focus on healthy eating are essential for maintenance of weight loss . Dietary management . Intake of saturated fat should be very low, and trans fats should be avoided completely . A reduction in overall carbohydrate intake is beneficial . Those carbohydrates that are consumed should be high in fiber . Artificial sweeteners are a reasonable alternative . Physical activity . Both aerobic and resistance activities are beneficial . A reduction in sedentary activity is also important . Physical activity is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6 . Weight-loss drugs . At present this is the only medication licensed for weight reduction . A number of agents are in development . The pharmacotherapy of obesity is discussed in Chapter 8 . Hypoglycemic agents . The introduction of several new agents has made the choice of second agent less obvious . Metformin is the only oral hypoglycemic agent shown to reduce mortality . Adverse effects include heart failure and bone fractures . Incretin-based therapies . These agents do not produce hypoglycemia . Pancreatitis may rarely occur . Long-acting formulations suitable for weekly administration are available . DPP-4 inhibitors are taken orally once or twice a day . Pancreatitis is a rarely described complication . Adverse effects predominantly relate to genital and lower urinary tract infections . Other safety considerations include changes in volume status, electrolytes and renal function .

Weight loss significantly improves the lipid profile . Dietary management . The prothrombotic state . Hyperinsulinemia leads to renal salt retention . Beta-blockers should be avoided because of the risk of weight gain . Other cardiac complications . The benefits of aggressive risk factor management are augmented by weight loss . 
Central pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as 'pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion (or dysfunction) of the central nervous system (CNS)' . It has now been recognized that epilepsy can be painful as can Parkinson's disease . Multiple sclerosis causes central pain in about 60% of patients . Post-stroke pain . reported that lesions limited to the ventral caudal thalamic nucleus may produce a similar presentation of central post-stroke pain . Thus, there are several sites of lesion associated with post-stroke pain; unfortunately, this does not yet provide insight into the precise mechanisms of such pain . Pain following spinal cord injury . The study of central pain arising from SCI has been more productive than that of post-stroke pain . which reported that at-level SCI pain often progressed to below-level pain - suggesting spinal and supraspinal mechanisms triggered by at-level SCI pain predispose to below-level 'central' pain . Brain-imaging studies have reported neuroplastic changes in the brain that correlate with the severity of post-SCI pain (see Figure 1.10) . Lesions in the brain . Stroke is the most common cause of neuropathic pain related to brain lesions . More than 8% of all patients who have had a stroke suffer with central pain . In view of the high incidence of stroke, about 90% of all central pain is associated with stroke . Because stroke is associated with communication difficulties, the high prevalence of central pain was not recognized until quite recently . Previously, it was erroneously believed that only thalamic lesions resulted in central pain . reported that 34% had below-level neuropathic pain (see pain taxonomy, Table 7.2), which was deemed to be central pain . A further 41% had at-level neuropathic pain that probably started at the peripheral level, but usually became 'centralized' . Musculoskeletal and visceral pain contributed to an overall prevalence of 81% of participants reporting pain . Onset of central pain . Time of pain onset after the initial lesion is extremely variable . With stroke, 63% reported onset of central pain within 1 month, 19% between 1 and 6 months and another 19% between 6 and 12 months . Sometimes onset of central pain occurs several years after injury . Pain sites . Patients report that pain can be triggered by emotional situations and may be decreased by intense concentration on work or other mental activities . More than 70% of post-stroke patients suffer allodynia . Central pain is one of the most challenging of all chronic pain conditions . However, differential diagnosis of the type of pain is crucial to distinguish nociceptive pain and peripheral neuropathic pain from central pain (see Table 7.2) . At 12-month follow-up, patients receiving CBT had decreased levels of depression and anxiety but no change in pain . Control patients showed no changes . In 2008, Finnerup evaluated published randomized controlled trials in central pain with at least 10 participants . In contrast, there is no evidence for the efficacy of amitriptyline at doses of 50-125 mg in post-SCI central pain . Some studies of intravenous lidocaine infusion report short-term efficacy for SCI pain or post-stroke pain . One study supports its use for SCI pain . A study of the oral analog of lidocaine, mexiletine, reported efficacy for SCI pain . Intravenous ketamine has been reported to reduce continuous or evoked pain in small studies . However, Hocking and Cousins reported no evidence of long-term efficacy in any chronic pain condition when given by the oral route . One study of the cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at a dose of 10 mg reported efficacy in patients with multiple sclerosis . A second study reported an oromucosal spray based on whole-plant cannabis to be effective in relieving central pain . Spinal cord stimulation has proven to be unsuccessful in the large majority of individuals with central pain . Strictly speaking this is a 'peripheral lesion'; however, often there is extensive damage to the spinal cord and the pain is similar to central pain . Intrathecal baclofen relieves the muscle spasm and associated spasticity in SCI patients and may relieve pain associated with spasticity . 
It also gives a good indication of fluid intake . The diary for a patient with OAB will show frequent, irregular, small-volume voids . Urodynamic studies are rarely indicated initially in patients who have symptoms suggestive of OAB, and most patients receive empirical treatment (drugs and or behavioral) whether or not urodynamic studies show detrusor overactivity . The only real role for these tests in patients with OAB symptoms is if conservative therapy fails and more invasive treatment is contemplated . Urodynamic investigation is necessary for the diagnosis of detrusor overactivity . It is important to note, however, that only approximately 50% of patients with symptoms of detrusor overactivity will have an abnormality on supine slow-filling cystometry . If symptoms suggest detrusor overactivity but filling cystometry reveals a stable bladder, additional provocative procedures during filling, such as coughing and changes in posture, may reveal detrusor overactivity . A typical cystometry trace from a patient with detrusor overactivity is shown in Figure 2.5 . Behavioral therapy (sometimes referred to as 'conservative treatment') helps an individual change habits to modify bladder symptoms and learn training techniques to control symptoms of bladder dysfunction . Alteration in fluid intake . Reduction in fluid intake can bring about a dramatic improvement in patients with OAB . However, many patients with OAB will report too severe a restriction of daily fluid intake which is also not a good practice . Reduction in caffeine intake . A trial of caffeine-intake reduction is indicated in all patients presenting with OAB symptoms . See Table 4.1 for specific foods and beverages that patients should consider reducing to determine the effect on OAB symptoms . Weight loss . There is evidence to suggest that weight loss, even a moderate amount of 5 to 10%, can help with the symptoms of OAB in overweight patients . It is therefore worth advising weight loss to any patient who has a body mass index above 30 kg/m . Table 4.2 provides a high fiber mixture that can be recommended for patients with constipation . Bladder training with urgency suppression . Patients are instructed to use techniques that control or suppress urgency . Complementary therapies are treatments that are not part of the traditional OAB treatments and include acupuncture, relaxation, meditation and herbal remedies . Acupuncture has been reported to reduce symptoms in both men and women with OAB, but there is a lack of controlled studies and skilled practitioners . Pharmacological therapy . Antimuscarinic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for symptoms of OAB and detrusor overactivity (Table 4.3) . The effects of antimuscarinic drugs in patients with OAB symptoms are shown in Table 4.4 . Research has shown that combining drug therapy with behavioral treatment will produce the best outcome in terms of reduction in OAB symptoms . Antimuscarinics are contraindicated in patients with closed-angle glaucoma or myasthenia gravis . Caution is advised in patients with significant bladder outlet obstruction and pre-existing constipation . Patients should be counseled on how to deal with side effects and given written information about the drug and simple management strategies . These drugs are taken once daily, which helps with compliance . Treatment with a second-generation antimuscarinic should, ideally, last for at least 4 to 6 weeks to determine effectiveness . Botulinum toxin (BTX) has the potential to revolutionize the management of refractory detrusor overactivity . BTX has been shown to be effective in the treatment of detrusor overactivity within 1-2 weeks of administration . The exact dosage, number of injections per treatment and sites of injection for neurogenic and idiopathic OAB have yet to be standardized . It is being used increasingly in the treatment of refractory detrusor overactivity . Sacral nerve stimulation has been shown to be safe, effective and durable . This treatment is approved for use in both Europe and the USA . Urgency incontinence is also reduced . A greater proportion of women with OAB have urgency incontinence (OAB-wet) than do men, who predominantly have OAB without incontinence (OAB-dry) . Not all patients with symptoms of OAB will be found to have detrusor overactivity, and not all patients with detrusor overactivity will have symptoms of bladder overactivity . 
When/if the various non-surgical measures have proved ineffective, too slow in providing adequate relief or poorly tolerated, injection options can be considered . Epidural injections are mainly used to relieve refractory sciatic nerve root pain, dysesthesias and/or associated paresis . There is no guarantee that symptoms will be relieved by a nerve root canal injection, or that, even if properly performed, the intervention will relieve pain or restore useful function to weakened muscles . Facet (zygapophyseal) joint injection . Fluoroscopic guidance now allows precise needle placement into the facet joint for therapeutic injections . In an early study, injections of 3 mL of 5% hypertonic saline into facet joints provoked immediate local deep, dull pain in both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic controls . It was then relieved by an intra-articular injection of a local anesthetic . Subsequent studies, however, have not produced consistent results with regard to relief of symptoms, arthrographic findings or responses to intra-articular anesthetic injections . Facet joint denervation . Because of the overlapping enervation between facet joints, stimulating and/or relieving the pain in one joint is non-specific and cannot identify the source of the back pain . Various facet joint neural denervations have been attempted, using freezing and thermal radiofrequency irradiation, as well as local phenol injections and rhizotomy . Facet joint corticosteroid injections share many of the above uncertainties because of the ambiguity of the symptoms and the poor correlation between symptoms and demonstrable facet joint pathology . Facet joint synovial cyst corticosteroid injection . Facet joint synovial cysts are not uncommonly found on MRI studies for low back and sciatic pain disorders . They may contribute to the symptomatology, and recede after percutaneous, image-guided intrasynovial facet joint corticosteroid injections . Sacroiliac joint injection . Despite the ambiguities in the clinical assessment of sacroiliac dysfunctions, almost all patients with suspected non-inflammatory sacroiliac joint pain recover spontaneously or with non-surgical therapies . For those few who do not improve, sacroiliac corticosteroid joint injections can be performed under fluoroscopic guidance in a manner similar to that used for facet joint injection . In one study, the sacroiliac joint was injected with lidocaine after visualization of the joint with contrast medium . Those patients who showed a positive response in terms of pain reduction on moving the sacroiliac joint area then received injections of betamethasone and lidocaine . Physical therapy was continued, and if improvement was not sustained, a second injection was given . Although far from conclusive, this suggests that sacroiliac joint pain may be responsive to intra-articular corticosteroid injections . Intrabursal injection . Low back pain, with or without sciatica, generally improves over time . Good results from appropriate surgery by expert surgeons have been reported to give complete relief of leg pain in 73% of patients and complete relief of back pain in 63% . Most patients with symptoms of nerve root compression respond, but 7% may experience a recurrence . These procedures use surgical approaches to shrink the nucleus and relieve its painful pressures, in a similar way to percutaneous chymopapain nucleolysis, which used an enzymatic approach . Percutaneous laser discectomy uses laser energy to perform the discectomy . Percutaneous thermal intradiscal catheters have been tried in a small series of patients with low back pain who would otherwise have been treated with a lumbar fusion procedure . A measure of pain relief was obtained by about 75% of the 25 patients after 7 months . anterior interbody fusion . posterior fusion . intertransverse process fusion . Even in surgically successful lumbar fusions, only about one-third of patients with L4-S1 degenerative spondylosis and chronic low back pain unresponsive to previous non-surgical therapies obtain some measure of pain relief, because the association of the mechanical and degenerative abnormalities and the pain is often not clear . Both procedures utilize a percutaneous needle to guide the injection of PMMA . They can be performed on an outpatient basis, and provide prompt and sustainable relief of the compression fracture pain . Injections and surgery . 
Antipsychotic medications constitute the primary class of drugs used to treat schizophrenia . First-generation antipsychotics . There are four major classes of these drugs (Table 10.1) . Their primary indication is for positive symptoms, such as hallucinations, delusions and positive formal thought disorder . They have limited efficacy for negative symptoms or cognitive impairments in people with schizophrenia . In the treatment of acute psychotic episodes, these drugs usually begin to improve symptoms within the first week . Maintenance treatment . FGAs are also indicated for the maintenance phase of treatment . A major problem in the maintenance treatment of people with schizophrenia is lack of adherence to the recommended pharmacological treatment regimen (see page 84) . Adverse effects . FGAs have a broad range of adverse effects . EPS are a major cause of non-adherence to treatment . Second-generation antipsychotics . They may also have noradrenergic, histaminergic and cholinergic effects . The first SGA was clozapine . Clozapine is the only SGA that has been approved for the treatment of positive symptoms resistant to other antipsychotics (Case history 10.1) . It is also effective for alleviating negative symptoms secondary to positive symptoms, EPS or dysphoric affect . Clozapine has not been shown to be effective for primary negative symptoms . Clozapine has been found to reduce suicidal ideation in schizophrenia and to reduce symptoms of hostility and violent behaviors . The unique pharmacological properties of clozapine may be related to its superior efficacy for positive symptoms and other illness dimensions . Adverse effects . Although clozapine causes few EPS and little TD, it does have a number of adverse effects that limit its use . However, none of the other SGAs has yet been shown to be as effective as clozapine for treatment-resistant positive symptoms . There is little evidence to suggest that these agents are effective for primary negative symptoms, though they may be of some benefit for treating secondary negative symptoms . Choosing the right drug . Personalized drug selection . Treatment history, medical history and medical risk factors must all be factored into the treatment decision . There is no single drug that suits all patients . Treatment of negative symptoms . The treatment of negative symptoms is a major challenge facing clinicians . FGAs and SGAs are relatively effective for treating secondary negative symptoms, but leave untouched the primary avolitional syndrome described so eloquently by Kraepelin (see Chapter 1) . The limited efficacy of antipsychotics has led to the investigation of alternative treatments for negative symptoms . Various approaches have been attempted based on specific neurochemical hypotheses of the pathophysiology of negative symptoms . As described in Chapter 8, this approach is based on the proposition that negative symptoms are due to decreased glutamatergic activity secondary to NMDA receptor hypofunction . In pilot studies, these agents were shown to be effective in ameliorating persistent negative symptoms . However, in a large multicenter study, neither glycine nor D-cycloserine was found to be more effective than placebo for these symptoms . Other pharmacological approaches for the treatment of negative symptoms include the use of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants, including mirtazapine, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors . Finally, there is emerging evidence that drugs that act at the alpha-7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor may have benefit for negative symptoms . Treatment of cognitive impairments . FGAs have limited effects on the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia . SGAs may have modest benefits for multiple cognitive processes, but these benefits are most likely to represent indirect effects mediated through decreased adverse effects, rather than direct cognitive-enhancing effects . To date, however, no drug has been approved for this indication . Treatment-resistant schizophrenia . As described in Chapter 8, despite the advent of clozapine, a large percentage of people with schizophrenia continue to experience considerable residual positive symptoms . A number of agents have been used in combination with ongoing antipsychotic treatment in an attempt to alleviate these symptoms . Antiepileptics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines may be more effective for the treatment of persistent symptoms of anxiety, depression, hostility or mania . The most common practice is to add a second antipsychotic medication in patients with residual positive symptoms . 
There are four broad treatment modalities for lymphoma . Underpinning each modality is supportive care, which is discussed in Chapter 11 . Fludarabine is a nucleoside analog . This has led to the development of many different combination chemotherapy regimens . For convenience, these regimens are often given a (sometimes) memorable acronym (see page 5) . General side effects . The development of some of these side effects may necessitate changes to treatment . Routes of chemotherapy administration . Some drugs may only be given by one route: for example, vincristine is given intravenously . Other drugs such as fludarabine may have an oral and an intravenous preparation . Only two drugs are commonly administered intrathecally: methotrexate and cytarabine . For intensive chemotherapy regimens, venous access may become problematic, but several devices are available to help overcome this problem . A Port-a-Cath ® is similar to a central venous cannula, though there is no external portion . Also, the tip of the line can act as a focus for the formation of a thrombus . Intrathecal chemotherapy can be administered in two main ways . lumbar puncture . Ommaya reservoir . Ommaya reservoir . Samples can be taken and chemotherapy administered by inserting a needle through the skin into the port . The reservoir is generally well tolerated and convenient, but infection is a risk . When these waves or particles come in contact with tissue, their energy is transferred to the constituent atoms and molecules . Radiotherapy can be administered in three ways . external beam . brachytherapy (via an implant) . Careful planning is essential for safety . To achieve this, several X-ray, CT and MRI studies are usually carried out . Its use requires special planning and more intensive input from medical physicists . Early side effects (Table 10.3) . Hair loss invariably occurs within the radiation field, but is usually temporary . Late side effects occur some time after the course of radiotherapy has finished . Perhaps the greatest concern is the risk of a second cancer developing . The incidence of lung cancer is increased in both sexes . Other long-term side effects include fibrosis and therefore dysfunction of affected organs . Head and neck irradiation can affect the salivary glands, leading to a chronically dry mouth . Irradiation involving the heart increases the risk of coronary artery disease . The most commonly used monoclonal antibody is rituximab, which binds to the CD20 molecule . Combination therapy . The main risk during this time is overwhelming infection with bacteria or fungi . Such a procedure can reduce the duration of marrow suppression from months to 7-10 days . Autologous transplant . These cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until required . Allogeneic transplant . Cell collection . The stem cells can be collected in one of two ways . The procedure lasts several hours and may need to be repeated on more than one day . To increase the yield of stem cells (known as the harvest), two other interventions can be used . One advantage of this procedure is that growth factor injections are not required . Transplantation in chemoresistant disease is generally unsuccessful . However, the stem-cell infusion can produce allergic-type reactions . The incidence of myelodysplasia and leukemia is also increased following an autologous transplant . This was termed myeloablative, because it destroyed the patient's bone marrow . These transplants are called reduced-intensity conditioning transplants . This approach has reduced mortality due to the procedure and has widened its use to older patients . The major risks of an allogeneic transplant are infection and graft-versus-host disease . Small-molecule pathway inhibitors . One constituent enzyme in this pathway is Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) . Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) is another enzyme in this pathway . Idelalisib is an effective inhibitor of the form of PI3 kinase found in lymphocytes . Again, encouraging activity has been observed . 
This is reflected in the inclusion of biologics in the WHO list of essential medicines . Biologics are inherently more expensive than past-generation medicines; they represent the result of costly investment in research and development and are manufactured using cellular-based technologies and utilizing gene expression . The combination of medical benefit but high costs for biologics creates the need for biosimilars . Costs and economics . The transition from the era of small molecule drugs to that of the biologics has markedly increased drug expenditure - and especially so for cancer . The high prices of biologics are justified by manufacturers on the basis of the investment in discovery, development and production . In 2017, for example, more than 200 molecules were in late-stage development for cancer and hematologic malignancies - up over 60% from a decade ago . Almost 90% of those therapies in development were targeted biological treatments . The current cost of biologics is rising quickly - threatening the sustainability of healthcare . So significant is this threat to delivering global cancer treatment that the WHO 70th World Health Assembly of 2017 established a Technical Working Party to report on the impact of drug pricing in cancer . The result has been problems with access to innovative medicines . Access to biological drugs, whether anti-inflammatory or cancer, is strongly associated with national wealth . Generic and biosimilar medicines . Although chemical and biological drugs are both pharmaceutical products, they are very different when comparing their manufacturing, chemical structure and modes of action (Table 1.3) . This means that while the generic and biosimilar competitors fulfill similar economic roles, they pose very different pharmacological problems to developers and medicines regulators . Chemical drugs have a well-defined structure, whereas that of biotechnological medicines is much more complex and heterogeneous . Chemical drugs are usually easy to reproduce given that their structure is precisely defined and expressed by the chemical formula . As they are proteins, biologics are very sensitive to enzymatic degradation - requiring most biologics to be injected or inhaled to avoid digestion in the gut while chemical drugs are typically oral medicines . Chemical drugs are also much more stable than biological drugs, which are sensitive to changes in physical conditions . A controlled manufacturing process is intrinsically important to biological medicines . Manufacturing is highly complex, requires more time and steps and is expensive . To develop a biologic, a manufacturer creates their own unique cell line through genetic engineering to preferentially express the recombinant gene for the protein product . The cell line is tested for product integrity, activity and overall quality . Importantly, minor variations could produce vastly different products as the process is extremely sensitive to changes in both manufacturing and production . The result is that, unlike conventional small molecule drugs, identical copies of biologics cannot be created - by definition, copies can only ever be 'similar' . Biologics in malignancies are helpfully divided into supportive care drugs and direct anti-cancer therapeutics . Variability in structure . To understand biosimilars you first need to understand biologics - for they have properties that are very different to the synthetic chemical drugs that preceded them . This variability has two main sources: inherent microheterogeneity and manufacturing process change . The primary amino acid structure of the drug remains identical, but changes such as glycosylation occur to the protein after translation from RNA to protein sequence in the host cell . Manufacturing process change . For this reason, most biological drugs undergo regular manufacturing process changes over the lifetime of a drug and so the product may not always remain identical over time . The manufacturing process can affect important aspects of the structure of a biological drug; a copied biologic can never therefore be entirely identical to the original reference product . Thus, the active substance of a biosimilar and its reference medicine is almost the same biological substance, but there may be minor differences as a result of their complex nature and production methods . In addition, manufacturing processes change frequently over the life of a biologic, adding to the potential for variability . Changes in manufacturing risks the introduction of more significant variation in the tertiary structure of a biologic, known as 'step changes' (see Figure 1.3) . Comparability of the drug before and after a step change needs to be demonstrated to assure regulators that safety and efficacy have not changed . This comparability is usually assessed using only analytic tests although, rarely, new regulatory trials have been required if the CQAs of the drug have changed . 
In the past, viscera were considered insensitive to pain . There are a variety of pain syndromes thought to be maintained by the persistent activation of visceral nociceptive fibers . However, there is a common pathophysiology and symptomatic management approach to all of these syndromes . Nociceptive input from the body surface travels along somatic nerves that enter spinal roots, accounting for the clear dermatomal organization of somatic pain sensations . Visceral sensations are often accompanied by autonomic reflexes and symptoms such as nausea, sweating and malaise . silent, which are activated by inflammation . The etiology of persistent visceral pain is often not certain . However, it is clear that visceral pain is not always linked to injury or active disease . It is believed that persistent activation of visceral fibers leads to central sensitization and to visceral hyperalgesia and that, just as for hyperalgesia from chronic somatic pain, excessive activity of N -methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptors is involved in this process . Autoimmune responses and inflammation could trigger the persistent activation of visceral afferent fibers . The possibility that visceral nerve injury may give rise to persistent visceral neuropathic pain is embodied in the term 'complex regional pain syndrome' (see Chapter 5) . Symptomatic management . Treatment of visceral chronic pain syndromes is aimed at symptomatic pain management . Today, visceral pain management focuses on both pharmacological and interventional techniques . As stress can activate or worsen visceral pain syndromes, stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and integrative therapies can be helpful adjuncts . In addition, there are specific treatment modalities that are used for the treatment of specific pain syndromes . irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . interstitial cystitis . male chronic pelvic pain syndrome . Irritable bowel syndrome . As much as 20% of the adult population exhibits symptoms of IBS . It cannot be diagnosed solely from the patient's medical history . Mild symptoms of IBS usually respond to stress management and changes in diet and lifestyle . If symptoms persist despite judicious use of laxatives for constipation, antidiarrheal agents or antispasmodics, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may relieve pain and diarrhea, as one of their side effects is constipation . Interstitial cystitis . Interstitial cystitis is a heterogeneous chronic pain syndrome that most commonly affects women (90%) . Symptoms include pain on bladder filling, pelvic pain and urinary urgency and frequency . The symptoms are often exacerbated by ovulation and during periods of stress . Two types of interstitial cystitis have been identified . ulcerative with bladder lesions, which responds better to therapies targeted at the bladder . To be diagnosed with interstitial cystitis for research purposes, patients must have glomerulations or Hunner's ulcer on cystoscopic examination, and either bladder pain or urinary urgency in the absence of other diseases that could cause the symptoms . Hydrodistention of the bladder, intravesical instillation therapy and transurethral resection of diseased bladder tissue have all been used to treat interstitial cystitis . However, the effectiveness of these therapies has not been rigorously evaluated . Tanezumab, a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for nerve growth factor (NGF), which prevents toxins interacting with nociceptive neurons in the bladder, has shown promise in reducing pain and urgency in women with interstitial cystitis, but not in men with pelvic pain . Further medication studies are needed . Male chronic pelvic pain syndrome . The diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain syndrome is made in men who complain of chronic pelvic pain but who have an unrevealing examination and work-up . Interstitial cystitis (see above) and male chronic pelvic pain syndrome may be the same syndrome . Endometriosis is a common gynecologic condition that produces cyclical pain . Women complain of severe dysmenorrhea, focal pelvic tenderness and dyspareunia . Medical therapy after surgical treatment reduces pain substantially, but trials have shown no difference postoperatively at 6 months if medical therapy is used or not . Although the efficacy of a variety of treatments has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, only 40-70% of women with severe cases of endometriosis become pain free . 
to obtain tissue for accurate pathological diagnosis . to relieve symptoms and improve outcome by maximal surgical resection . The past decades have brought about remarkable advances in the technical aspects of tumor removal . One such advance has been the routine use of cortical mapping and stereotactic volumetric resections . Other improvements have been seen in the area of surgical equipment, including robotics, lasers and ultrasonic aspirators . Perioperative assessment . The history and physical examination provide valuable information regarding the most likely diagnosis, and the potential role and risks of surgery . Following the clinical assessment, imaging plays a crucial role in surgical planning . The most commonly used preoperative imaging modalities are MRI and CT . Functional MRI is a relatively new option allowing localization of function . This technique exploits the focal changes in cerebral blood flow that occur in response to stereotypic repetitive activity . This information can be used to shape surgical strategy, but these findings usually require confirmation by intraoperative recording and stimulation . Intraoperative ultrasound is valuable in localizing subcortical tumors . Subsequent CT or MRI identifies the coordinates of the target of interest . Stereotactic biopsy is a relatively straightforward neurosurgical procedure . Stereotactic biopsies are not without shortcomings, the most important of which is a non-diagnostic or misleading result . Consequently, a diagnosis based on the histopathology of a stereotactic biopsy must be interpreted with caution . Clinical and imaging features should also be considered, and the diagnosis modified if necessary . This information helps the surgeon to perform a safer and more complete operation . Neurological deficit . Elderly infirm patients are most susceptible to these morbidities . Basic principles . A number of experimental approaches have been devised to circumvent the radioresistance of tumors . Radiotherapeutic techniques . In some cases, palliative radiotherapy is as short as one or two treatments . There are two means of administering radiation in this way . Particle-beam therapy . Heavy particles such as protons and neutrons are used in selected centers for specific tumors . These therapies require a cyclotron and are thus not widely available . Complications of cranial radiotherapy . Late delayed toxicities . The pathological hallmarks of this condition are demyelination and coagulative necrosis . A rare late effect of cranial irradiation is neoplasia . Future radiotherapy trends . However, a full assessment of the benefits of this technique awaits longer-term follow-up . Many pediatric intracranial tumors are treated primarily with chemotherapy for two reasons . This landmark trial has resulted in the widespread use of this regimen for glioblastoma and other malignant gliomas . Moreover, chemotherapy is a reasonable therapeutic option at recurrence following failure of initial therapy . Basic principles . Cellular kinetics . Chemotherapeutic agents affect dividing cells . Anaplastic and low-grade gliomas have much lower rates of division . Blood-brain barrier . In general, small lipid-soluble molecules with neutral charges are the most effective at crossing this barrier . Drug resistance . Malignant gliomas are clonal neoplasms with considerable genetic heterogeneity . For example, an enzyme called O . Drug delivery . To be effective, chemotherapy must reach its target . Concerns with oral delivery include variable absorption from the gut and patient compliance . All but the last technique are experimental . Specific agents . These drugs have modest activity against brain tumors . Nitrosoureas exert their antiproliferative effects by DNA alkylation . Procarbazine is a cell-cycle non-specific alkylating agent administered orally . It inhibits DNA, RNA and protein synthesis . Its major toxicities include rash, nausea and vomiting, and myelosuppression . Toxicity is primarily neurological, and can be dose-limiting . Common side effects are peripheral sensorimotor or autonomic neuropathies . Platinum analogs . Cisplatin and carboplatin cause DNA damage by intrastrand and interstrand crosslinking . New agents . 
Pregnancy is a well-established trigger for TTP, accounting for 5-10% of all cases of TTP in UK and French registries . In cases of TTP, however, ADAMTS13 activity falls to a critically low level . Meanwhile, pregnancy-induced changes may trigger iTTP . Onset of TTP can occur throughout pregnancy and into the postpartum period . Presentation was commonest in the second trimester in 42 de novo presentations reported in the French registry, whereas it was most common in the third trimester and postpartum period in 52 UK cases of de novo and relapsing TTP . Of 42 French cases reported, 32 occurred in first pregnancies and 29 of the 42 had no discernible trigger other than pregnancy . Presenting features are generally similar to those seen in non-pregnancy cases, though associated hypertension and proteinuria is often found, which can lead, erroneously, to a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia . Late-onset cTTP accounted for 66% (23/35) of UK cases of pregnancy-associated initial presentations of TTP and 24% (10/42) of French cases . As is the case in non-pregnancy presentations, congenital cases cannot be distinguished from immune cases on the basis of clinical features alone . However, certain features may be more suggestive of a congenital etiology . First, cTTP nearly always presents in the first pregnancy, whereas iTTP can present initially in subsequent pregnancies . Third, a predominance of neurological symptoms was described in UK congenital cases compared with immune-mediated cases . Classic presentation of acute TTP . Various international and national TTP registries have allowed us to understand how TTP typically presents . The most common presentation of acute TTP is a previously healthy young to middle-aged adult with MAHA, severe thrombocytopenia and features of end-organ damage . Renal symptoms . Gastrointestinal symptoms, presumably resulting from intestinal ischemia, are also commonly reported in TTP . Other symptoms . Atypical presentations in adulthood . The spectrum of severity of presentation in TTP is marked . Although TTP usually first presents in young to middle-aged adults, de novo presentation in the elderly is seen . Childhood and adolescent onset . Onset of TTP in childhood or adolescence is also seen, though less commonly than in adulthood, accounting for approximately 10% of all first presentations of TTP . The major difference is the higher proportion of cTTP cases . While about 98% of cases of TTP presenting in adulthood are immune-mediated, only about two-thirds of cases of childhood-onset TTP are immune-mediated . The presentation of cTTP is discussed on pages 18-20 . The presentation of iTTP in children and adolescents was the subject of a French series of 45 cases . Association with other autoimmune diseases . The most commonly associated autoimmune condition is SLE . The French study revealed 26 cases of SLE in 261 cases of TTP . Not all cases of thrombotic microangiopathy associated with connective tissue disorders are TTP, however: in a Japanese series of 127 cases, only a minority had severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . In contrast to the typical onset in adulthood of iTTP, the rarer congenital form of TTP (accounting for about 5% of all cases of TTP), has classically been associated with an acute onset in the neonatal period or childhood . However, through the analysis of registry data,, , it is now well established that clinical presentation is diverse, with a substantial proportion of cTTP cases actually presenting in adulthood, especially in the context of pregnancy . While all cases have persistent severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, additional triggers such as infection or pregnancy are required to provoke acute symptoms of overt TTP . Of 73 UK TTP Registry cases of cTTP, 38% initially presented in childhood/adolescence, as did 58% of 43 Japanese cases . Meanwhile, 62% of cases of cTTP in the UK Registry were diagnosed in adulthood, with a median age at diagnosis of 31 years . Of note, just over two-thirds of these diagnoses in adulthood were associated with pregnancy . Genotype-phenotype associations may be of relevance . End-organ damage in cTTP . Subacute features of cTTP . 
Stem cell therapy . Stem cell therapy remains a promising treatment for patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by coronary ischemia/infarction . Intracoronary or intramyocardial injections of skeletal myoblasts or bone-marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMSCs) have led to a modest improvement in cardiac performance in some studies, including improvement in the LVEF and reduction in the size of scar tissue and cardiac volume . However, the clinical effect of such therapies has not yet been proven . The recent CHART-1 trial was the largest multicenter and multinational study of stem cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF less than 35% and worsening HF (class III/IV within the preceding 12 months) . The primary efficacy endpoint was neutral but the exploratory analyses suggested a benefit (trends in reduction of clinical endpoints, and improvement in quality of life and physical fitness) in a large subset of the population defined by the degree of LV dilation and a lower number of injections . In addition, intracoronary administration of BMSCs seems to be associated with improvements in cardiac contractile and microvascular function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy . Intensive work in this and other areas (including the type of cell used, and the method and time of delivery) continues . However, stem cell therapy is not yet ready to become a mainstay of clinical practice . Phrenic nerve stimulation in patients with central sleep apnea . This is an alternative approach to the treatment of patients with central sleep apnea (CSA), designed to restore a physiological breathing pattern throughout sleep . It uses a fully implantable system with transvenous leads designed for the long-term application of transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation (The Remedē System, Respicardia) . The system is fully automated, thereby eliminating patient non-adherence . It works by stimulating the diaphragm during sleep to stabilize gas exchange and maintain normal breathing . It has recently been shown to stabilize the breathing pattern, reduce the number of apneic events, improve oxygen saturation and increase end-tidal carbon dioxide without suppressing the intrinsic drive to breathe . Future large studies in patients with HF and CSA are awaited . Patiromer - a new treatment for chronic hyperkalemia . Hyperkalemia is common in patients receiving HF medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone or eplerenone, and often limits their use . Management of hyperkalemia in these patients is often challenging and comprises dietary restriction and dose reduction or withdrawal of the offending agent . Potassium-binding resins, such as resonium A (sodium polystyrene sulfonate) and calcium resonium (calcium polystyrene sulfonate) are commonly used in the management of chronic hyperkalemia . However, high quality evidence of the effectiveness of these agents is lacking . Furthermore, they can cause serious or intolerable gastrointestinal adverse events ranging from gastric irritation to (rarely) ischemic colitis, gastrointestinal obstruction, ulceration, perforation or necrosis . Patiromer is a non-absorbable compound that predominantly binds to potassium in the colon and exchanges it for calcium . The most common adverse effects are constipation (11%) and hypokalemia (3%) . Short-term studies have confirmed its efficacy in maintaining normokalemia in patients treated with HF medications . Subcutaneous furosemide . Furosemide, the loop diuretic used to treat congestive HF, is licensed for use in oral and intravenous forms (see pages 96 -) . For patients with recurrent fluid overload, intravenous administration in a hospital setting is the only licensed choice, although in some countries off-label subcutaneous furosemide has been used for several years in the palliative care setting . A new formulation of subcutaneous furosemide that uses a dedicated sc2Wear™ infusor pump has been developed . The drug pH has been reduced to a neutral level to minimize the risk of local irritation or discomfort . Subcutaneous furosemide allows greater flexibility of administration, avoids the need for intravenous placement and potentially reduces the cost of care . 
The histological types of primary carcinoma that occur in the bladder are shown in Table 2.1 . It accounts for almost 90% of the bladder cancers that occur in industrialized countries such as the USA and the UK, and most discussion of bladder cancer relates to this type . Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is an additional and important type seen in about 10% of cases (sometimes as secondary CIS associated with papillary UC) . CIS is a flat, intraepithelial, high-grade carcinoma, often with increased numbers of mitotic structures . In approximately half of all cases, CIS occurs as one or more de novo lesions (primary CIS), while in the remainder it occurs in association with either papillary or solid tumors (secondary CIS) . Coexistent CIS and papillary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer confers a worse prognosis than papillary disease alone . The classification of the tumor depends on the dominant histological type . This stem cell type has features of UC as well as showing squamous and glandular differentiation within individual tumor cells . This may explain why metastases with variant histology (exempli gratia as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) are seen in patients with pure UC primary tumors . Squamous cell carcinoma has a nodular, infiltrative growth pattern and is usually invasive . It accounts for 5-10% of bladder cancers in the USA and UK . Adenocarcinoma is rare, accounting for about 2% of bladder cancers . The remainder of adenocarcinomas are associated with bladder exstrophy or are non-urachal in origin . Adenocarcinomas are usually solitary, high grade and ulcerative . Any bladder adenocarcinoma may be mucin-producing . Many patients with adenocarcinoma have poor prognosis because the tumor is already at an advanced stage at diagnosis . Micropapillary cancer (Figure 2.2) is a particularly aggressive form of high-grade UC and is associated with a high risk of early muscle invasion and metastasis . Small-cell neuroendocrine bladder cancer is similar to the more common small-cell cancer of the lung . This histological pattern is associated with rapid growth and early metastasis, and may occur as a pure variant or mixed with typical UC . The cells have a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and grow in sheets or nests of cells . This variant should be distinguished from undifferentiated UC, which is the least differentiated of the UCs . Sarcomatoid bladder cancer is a rare variant, accounting for 0.3% of cases . Lymphoepithelial-like bladder cancer accounts for 0.4-1.3% of bladder cancers . About 3% of bladder cancers contain this variant . Nested variant urothelial cancer is also rare, accounting for 0.3% of invasive cancers . Nested variant is not associated with overlying CIS, and cannot be classified as high grade . Staging and grading . Accurate staging and grading of UC is essential, as it determines the most effective treatment . The current grading system, introduced in 2004, stratifies bladder cancer into low and high grade, replacing the WHO 1973 three-grade system, as illustrated in Figure 2.6 . Among patients who do experience recurrence, 20-30% of tumors (usually high grade) may progress to a higher stage . Conversely, 40% of patients who have an initial UC of the renal pelvis will subsequently develop a UC in the bladder . On average, muscle-invasive disease is associated with regional lymph node metastases in 25% of patients . Distant metastases are present at initial diagnosis in 5% of patients . Mortality due to UC is directly related to the pathological stage and grade of bladder cancer (Table 2.2) . For patients with T2/T3aN0M0 disease, the 5-year survival rate is 60-70%, despite radical cystectomy . In patients who experience disease progression, this occurs within 2-3 years of cystectomy in about 80% of cases . The 5-year survival rate in patients with T4 UC is only 10-20%; survival of those with T4a disease is at the upper end of this range . For patients with visceral metastases the 5-year survival rate, irrespective of chemotherapy, is only about 10% . 
The causes of daytime frequency are shown in Table 2.1 . Nocturia is the complaint of waking to void one or more times during the night . Urgency is a sudden compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer . It can occur several times a day or week . It is caused by involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling/urine storage . Nocturnal enuresis is the loss of urine during sleep . Its causes include incomplete bladder emptying . Postmicturition dribble refers to the leakage of urine after micturition . Urethral stricture or diverticulum may be rare causes of this condition . Physical examination . Neurological examination . If a neurological cause is suspected, it is important to pay particular attention to sacral neuronal pathways . Abdominal examination . Scars from previous surgery should be noted . An attempt to palpate the kidneys should be made . Genital examination is essential in both women and men . Pelvic masses may also be identified . The woman should be asked to cough and strain in an attempt to demonstrate stress incontinence . Ideally, this should be done with a full bladder . Rectal masses are obviously abnormal and require prompt referral . The status of the anal sphincter musculature should be noted by determining strength and tone . Further investigations . The investigations undertaken will depend to some extent on the facilities available . Psychological and cognitive assessment . Functional and environment assessment . Environmental assessment should include identifying the location of the toilet . Quality of life . Frequency/volume bladder record . Eliciting an estimate of the volume of leakage during incontinence episodes is helpful . The following descriptions of urine leakage can be used . Small volume (< 30 mL) - enough to make underwear wet if no protective pad is worn . Abnormalities that may be demonstrated on a frequency/volume bladder record include . fluid restriction . excessive fluid intake (through habit or on medical advice) . urinary incontinence and the associated circumstances (id est urgency, effort, unaware) . type and number of absorbent pads used . An example of a completed record is shown in Figure 2.3 . Urinalysis and culture . The investigation and management of hematuria are described in detail in Chapter 6 . It has a higher sensitivity for small calculi and early neoplasms . Urodynamic studies . Urodynamic investigation may be indicated in the following cases . treatment failure . complex mixed lower urinary tract symptoms . before incontinence surgery . women with POP . urinary retention . neurogenic disease . Empirical treatment is therefore not possible . The patient should undergo urodynamic investigation so that appropriate treatment can be offered . Before incontinence surgery . The initial investigation should be measurement of free urinary flow and postvoid residual volume . Pelvic Organ Prolapse . Neuropathic bladder . A voided volume of at least 150 mL is desirable for the flow rate to be interpreted accurately . Normal findings are . total voided volume greater than 200 mL . volume passed over a period of 15-20 seconds . maximum flow rate above 20 mL/second . smooth crescendo parabolic curve . Table 2.3 lists the measurements required during filling cystometry . Figure 2.5 shows some typical traces . Filling rates are classified as follows . fast: above 100 mL/minute . medium: 10-100 mL/min . slow: less than 10 mL/min . The following can be evaluated during filling cystometry . Strong desire to void - this is a persistent desire to void but without fear of leakage, felt at capacity . Voiding cystometry (pressure-flow study) . The urinary flow rate and detrusor pressure are recorded . A radiopaque contrast medium is used instead of saline . It may be more useful than cystometry alone in the assessment of complex cases . Water is the preferred distension medium used during cystoscopy . 
This category of tumor accounts for 45-50% of all gliomas, arising most frequently in individuals aged 45-65 years . Glioblastomas usually arise in the deep white matter of the cerebrum, with the temporal and frontal lobes being the most common sites . MRI is more accurate than CT for determining tumor size and extent . Like all gliomas, glioblastomas are infiltrative tumors . Glioblastomas are highly aggressive and survival statistics remain poor . Median survival for patients offered only supportive care is approximately 14 weeks . The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is now established for glioblastoma . A recently completed randomized phase III study has demonstrated improved survival for patients receiving chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment . Additionally, nearly 50% of patients who had tumors with a methylated phenotype had a 2-year survival following combined modality therapy . Despite this very important therapeutic advance, most individuals with glioblastomas will experience tumor recurrence within 2 years of the initial diagnosis . Tumor recurrence is usually local and confined to the brain . At recurrence, further surgery and chemotherapy can extend life in a minority of patients . Bevacizumab is generally well tolerated, with the most common toxicity being hypertension . Studies are under way to further define the use of bevacizumab in patients with glioblastoma, including very large phase III trials in patients with newly diagnosed disease . Anaplastic astrocytoma . Between 10% and 30% of all gliomas are anaplastic astrocytomas . These tumors tend to arise in individuals aged 35-55 years . Anaplastic astrocytomas are associated with better survival statistics than glioblastomas, with a median survival of 24-36 months with treatment . Aggressive treatment including maximal surgery and radiotherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy has resulted in reported median survival in excess of 5 years in some series . The use of adjuvant chemotherapy is more common in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas than in those with glioblastomas, but remains controversial . Despite initial attempts at control, recurrence is expected, usually as a glioblastoma . At recurrence, the treatment options include further surgery, chemotherapy or experimental agents . Low-grade astrocytoma . Most patients present with seizures only and have no fixed neurological deficits . Following surgery, radiotherapy is often administered, and recent studies have helped to define appropriate timing and dose of irradiation . These factors include age greater than 40 years, fixed neurological deficits, and tumor enhancement or mass effect on imaging . The PCV regimen has traditionally been the chemotherapy of choice for patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors . Low-grade oligodendrogliomas are also sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents, although the role of chemotherapy in patients with this tumor type is less established . Pilocytic astrocytoma . Pilocytic astrocytomas account for fewer than 5% of gliomas . Signs and symptoms are related to tumor location, and are usually insidious because these tumors are indolent . Complete surgical resection of pilocytic astrocytomas can be curative, and has been associated with 95% disease-free survival at 25 years for patients with cerebellar tumors . For patients with supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas, 10-year survival rates of 80-100% have been reported following surgery . Recurrence of pilocytic astrocytomas is managed by reoperation if possible, or by radiotherapy . For very young patients who should not receive irradiation, chemotherapy has been administered with reasonable response rates but poor survival . They are most prevalent in patients aged 5-15 years, and represent the third most common intracranial neoplasm in childhood . The primary therapy for these tumors is surgical, and a complete resection can be curative . For malignant tumors, or recurrent ependymomas following surgical resection, radiotherapy is often indicated . More commonly, chemotherapy is given for progressive or recurrent disease following surgical and radiotherapeutic failure, and has only modest impact . Common presenting symptoms include seizures, focal neurological deficits and headache . 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma, HCC) is a malignancy of hepatocytes . HCC is a common cause of mortality in the developing world . Although currently less common in the developed world, the incidence is expected to rise as patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C age . Most cases of HCC occur in liver that is already cirrhotic . Thus, patients with advanced viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis or alcoholic liver disease are at risk . Hepatitis B presents a unique risk, as there is evidence that a tumor may develop in the absence of cirrhosis - presumably via direct integration of viral DNA into the host genome . Clinical presentation . HCC is difficult to diagnose until there is widespread involvement of the liver . The standard liver biochemical markers are not particularly helpful, although sudden elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase may suggest obstruction of the biliary tree by a tumor . In the absence of specific clinical findings, most hepatologists suspect HCC when there is a change in the expected clinical course of a patient with otherwise stable liver disease . Because of the non-specific clinical presentation, the diagnosis of HCC is typically made using serum tumor markers, imaging studies and, at times, liver biopsy . Immature (fetal) liver cells synthesize alpha fetoprotein (AFP) . Malignant hepatocytes resemble immature hepatocytes, and AFP is an important marker for HCC . A sudden rise in serum AFP or absolute levels greater than 500 ng/mL are highly suggestive of HCC . Lower levels can be seen with any liver disease that provokes hepatocyte regeneration (ongoing hepatitis, cirrhosis) . AFP is also produced during pregnancy and by some germ-cell tumors . Unfortunately, not all HCCs produce AFP; 30-40% of patients with HCC have normal AFP levels, which considerably limits the usefulness of AFP for screening . Imaging studies are particularly useful when confirming a diagnosis of HCC . CT, especially when used with rapid scanning techniques, helps to identify and stage the tumor . It has better sensitivity than ultrasonography, making it particularly useful for detecting small tumors . Many hepatologists believe that suspected HCC lesions (suspected on the basis of imaging characteristics, growth patterns and elevated AFP levels) should not be biopsied for fear that the biopsy may spread the tumor . Available data do not strongly support the efficacy of screening for HCC . Nevertheless, because there are few symptoms or objective signs of the tumor before it progresses to an incurable stage, and because screening is associated with few risks, many practitioners offer screening to their patients . Patients with established cirrhosis, particularly from viral hepatitis or hemochromatosis, are at the highest risk for HCC . An algorithm for investigating a liver nodule found on hepatic ultrasound is shown in Figure 10.1 . If tumors are small, there is no evidence of extrahepatic spread and the patient has preserved liver function, surgical resection may be considered . Unfortunately, however, few patients with HCC have resectable tumors or sufficient hepatic reserve to tolerate a partial hepatectomy, and approximately 50% of tumors will have recurred at 5 years . The prognosis is best for patients with either a single small tumor (less than 5 cm) or no more than three lesions, each smaller than 3 cm . Many patients with HCC are not candidates for liver transplantation or surgical resection . Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) both embolizes the tumor (to interrupt its blood supply) and infuses chemotherapeutic agents directly into the tumor via the hepatic artery . Ablation techniques may have curative potential for small tumors . Therapy for most patients with HCC is best provided by specialized centers, where patients may be considered for inclusion in randomized controlled trials . Other primary hepatic tumors . Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy in children . It usually presents with abdominal swelling, weight loss and failure to thrive, and serum AFP is almost always elevated . If detected in early stages, a well-encapsulated tumor may be surgically resectable . Angiosarcoma is an uncommon malignancy of hepatic mesenchymal cells . Histologically, the tumor is characterized by numerous blood-filled cystic structures lined with malignant endothelial cells . 
Pathological anticoagulants . Almost all of these anticoagulants are antibodies, and most are considered to be autoimmune in origin . Antibodies to specific clotting factors (acquired hemophilia) . See also Chapter 6 . Clinical presentation . Rarely, these antibodies appear during or after an otherwise normal pregnancy . A quantitative assay, the Bethesda method, indicates the titer (potency) of the anticoagulant . Anticoagulant antibodies arising in association with other diseases . Amyloid proteins may absorb FX, leading to a bleeding diathesis . Such complexes form when phospholipids, especially phosphatidylserine, are exposed on cell membranes . Diagnosis and management . Under these circumstances, hemorrhage rather than thrombosis is the major clinical manifestation . Therapeutic anticoagulants and antithrombotic agents . Five major classes of antithrombotic agents are in clinical use . coumarin derivatives (warfarin, acenocoumarol) . direct FXa inhibitors (exempli gratia apixaban, rivaroxaban) . Major bleeding associated with antithrombotic agents is defined as . decline in the hemoglobin of more than 20 g/L . need for transfusion of 2 or more units of blood . intracranial, retroperitoneal or fatal bleeding . In some clinical studies a bleeding index has been used to define major bleeding . Inhibitors of platelet function . This results in impaired generation of thromboxane A and prostacyclin . Drugs used for the treatment of ischemic vascular disease are shown in Table 13.5 . Inhibition of platelet function persists for 10 days to 2 weeks after the agents are discontinued . Most bleeding is from the gastrointestinal tract and at sites of arterial puncture . Surgical interventions . Heparins in current clinical use are . unfractionated heparin . pentasaccharide (fondaparinux) . The principal adverse effect of heparins is bleeding . Oral factor Xa inhibitors . Rivaroxaban and apixaban are among several FXa inhibitors entering clinical practice . It is usually unnecessary, and not advised, to discontinue warfarin for minor surgical procedures . Untoward bleeding would not be anticipated with INRs of 1.4 or lower . Drug interactions . Many drugs affect the response to coumarins; some examples are listed in Table 13.7 . These drugs enhance the effect of coumarins in a variety of ways . Displacement of coumarin from its protein binding sites, increasing the amount of free drug . Alteration of the synthesis of clotting factors by interfering with the generation of reduced vitamin K or by other mechanisms . These patients generally require smaller drug doses and tend to have INRs that rise above the therapeutic range . Direct thrombin inhibitors . Bivalirudin has a half-life of 25 minutes and is given intravenously in doses based on bodyweight . Lepirudin and argatroban are usually given by continuous intravenous infusion and must be closely monitored . Values of aPTT above 100 seconds are regularly associated with hemorrhage, which may be severe . It has a half-life of 14-17 hours and does not require monitoring . In addition, prodrugs like dabigatran that are cleaved in the gut can be removed by activated charcoal . Thrombolytic agents . The plasminogen is converted to plasmin and plasmin digests fibrin . Plasmin that escapes from the clot is neutralized by circulating antiplasmin . Three thrombolytic agents are in current use . Patients receiving thrombolytic agents should be under continuous observation, usually in an intensive care unit . These agents disappear from the circulation within minutes and often nothing more needs to be done . Doses are reduced if renal failure is present . Once there has been exposure to these drugs thrombi may be more resistant to subsequent attempts at lysis . 
As mentioned previously, these therapies are aimed at managing the pain of osteoarthritis (OA) . It is worth considering the optimal timing of analgesia - that is, when the patient has most symptoms (see pages 87 -) . Therapies with a good safety profile . However, recent studies have called into question the true benefit of paracetamol in OA . The site of action of the drug, which has some weak anti-inflammatory action, seems to be in the central nervous system (CNS) . Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver and can accumulate in patients with chronic liver disease . The major concern lies in overdose, which can lead to acute hepatic toxicity that may be enhanced by alcohol . Multiple daily applications (2-4 times a day depending on the product) are usually required, which may limit adherence . Topical NSAIDs are generally very well tolerated . The commonest problems are burning, itch and rash at the site of application . Low systemic levels of absorbed NSAID mean much less gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity than with oral NSAIDs . Topical capsaicin is derived from hot chili peppers . The strength of the preparations generally used in OA trials is 0.025%, and usually three or four applications a day are required . A small number of randomized controlled trials in OA involving various peripheral joints have demonstrated a small effect in reducing symptoms . The commonest problem is burning of the skin in the area of application, which may subside after 1-2 weeks of continuous use . NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors . NSAIDs are used by almost 25% of people with OA, with usage often limited by toxicity or contraindications . Understanding their true usage is complicated by the availability of over-the-counter NSAIDs . Some of the commonly used traditional NSAIDs are ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac . On balance, these studies show moderate reduction in patient symptoms while the NSAID is being used . COX-2 inhibitors . The widespread use of NSAIDs means that significant morbidity and mortality due to these agents are encountered across communities . Subsequent analyses now suggest that this increased CV risk is also present with traditional NSAIDs and is likely to be dose-dependent . It is important to remember that older patients with significant comorbidities, who use multiple medications, will often use these drugs . Certainly, patients should be fully informed of the potential risks associated with these agents . Table 8.2 provides a summary of prescribing advice with respect to GI and CV risk . A safe rule is to use the lowest possible dose of drug for the shortest period of time . However, such recommendations were made on the basis of cost-effectiveness for generic, not brand-name, PPIs . If a person is using ASA for modest CV risk, then most NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated . If GI toxicity is the concern, the GI advantage of a COX-2 inhibitor may be lost after it is combined with ASA . Also, some traditional NSAIDs may interfere with the antiplatelet effect of ASA . It is worth monitoring blood pressure and occasionally renal function in people using NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors in the long term . In addition, risk factors change over time so periodic review of prescribing is important . All opioids work by acting on endogenous opioid receptors, although specific agents may work at different receptor subtypes . Transdermal patches containing buprenorphine or fentanyl can provide sustained release over days . However, there are still relatively few well-designed trials of opioids in OA . The use of opioids always requires careful consideration of the patient's age, general state, comorbidities and other medications . Opioids also have potential harms including addiction and overdose . Opioids are recommended in all modern evidence-based OA guidelines . Potential hepatotoxicity means that laboratory monitoring is recommended . Timing of pharmacological interventions . It is worth considering the likely duration of effect of a pharmacological intervention, especially in people who only use analgesics intermittently . Short-acting agents may also be useful before undertaking a weight-bearing activity that predictably brings on pain, such as going shopping . When people have symptoms predominantly at night, an agent with a longer half-life may be appropriate to provide sustained analgesia . 
In these committees there are generally three groups to satisfy when choosing which drugs, brands and formulations to stock: pharmacists, physicians and payers . The final committee decision needs to ensure safety and effectiveness and economic feasibility of each choice . Initial assessments for pharmacists . The following need to be considered at the outset . Is the biosimilar licensed for the proposed indication(s)? Will it be used for all indications or for specific ones? . The patient groups - therapeutic area, adult and pediatric? . Are there differences between the reference and the biosimilar in . strength, presentation and/or preparation . administration type . storage requirements and stability . routes and duration of administration . Are there clinical data available? . Safety and efficacy . Biosimilars approved for use in the USA or EU are deemed by regulators as safe and effective . Post-approval data, if available, may reveal differences not apparent before approval . Clinical data and immunogenicity . The amount and quality of available clinical data, particularly for the indications under consideration for formulary inclusion, and any post-approval data should be considered . If available, data from other countries should be included . Safety surveillance data are important, as issues around immunogenicity with biologics are well documented (for example, see below) . The increase was linked with a specific preparation of erythropoietin (Eprex [epoetin alfa]) . Information on immunogenic events for newly introduced biosimilar products may be limited at first . Accurate medical records for biosimilars need to be established within the organization and regular evaluations of adverse drug reactions scheduled . Product characteristics . In addition to study data, committees may want to consider the product's prescribing information . Manufacturers' processes . Manufacturers of biosimilars can expect to answer enquiries about . arrangements and processes in place to ensure a reliable supply (exempli gratia reserve levels held in stock, plans to cope with increase in demand) . history of shortages and recalls (for the drug in question and others) . handling practices, such as maintaining and monitoring temperature throughout distribution and processes to ensure products are contamination free . quality-control practices . security procedures . anti-counterfeit practices . Are there differences that need to be addressed to reduce dispensing errors? . Names and tracking . It will be necessary to easily distinguish biosimilars and biologics, so before a biosimilar is added to the formulary, the product must be clearly labeled . The product should also be easy to differentiate from other similar products . Is the name distinguishable from the reference product? . Managing and tracking interchangeable biosimilars that are used for several indications presents an additional operational challenge . Will the IT system be able to track each biosimilar and, potentially, distill information about biosimilar-specific adverse events? . Ease of administration . The label should be clear and descriptive for patients . Any delivery device and/or container should be easy to use by health professionals and patients . Compatibility with compounding technology . It is prudent to consider not just compatibility of the biosimilar compared with the reference, but also whether there are differences in technician time and preparatory techniques . Is the product compatible with the compounding technology used? . Brand-switching strategies . The Cancer Vanguard advocates forming a multidisciplinary steering group (Table 8.1) working in the therapy area to drive biosimilar switching and adoption within a health trust . Patients should be involved, and the Vanguard suggests convening a meeting or forum to introduce plans, listen to concerns and answer questions . Patient communication . If these are not available, the cost of developing and administering them will also have to be borne in mind . Economic considerations . When working toward formulary inclusion, the economic impact should be assessed from both payer and patient perspectives, addressing total cost impact rather than just the acquisition costs . The cost of the biosimilar versus the reference product should be considered in the context of financial arrangements that favor one product or the other . If the biosimilar manufacturer does not provide an assistance program similar to that of the reference product, this may weaken the case for including the biosimilar . 
Abdominal compartment syndrome . Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is the steady-state pressure maintained within the abdominal cavity . IAP is measured in patients in an intensive care unit setting via an indwelling urinary catheter (transbladder technique) and is usually 5-7 mmHg in critically ill adults . OF can also arise from organ compression resulting, for example, in difficulties expanding the lungs and decreased chest compliance . Very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared aggressive versus conservative treatment of pancreatitis-associated ACS . In critically ill patients with increasing IAP, some non-invasive measures may be useful . Nasogastric and colonic decompression via tubes should be used in cases of gastric or colonic dilatation . Neuromuscular blockade with artificial respiration decreases IAP by reducing abdominal musculature tone and increasing abdominal compliance . Patients with no response can undergo abdominal decompression surgery (Figure 8.1) . The indications, timing and technique for decompression surgery are a matter of debate, as there is no good-quality evidence from RCTs . Currently, midline laparostomy seems to be the method of choice . Disconnected tail syndrome . A healthy pancreas produces 1-4 liters of pancreatic juice per day . central pancreatic gland necrosis may result in complete transection of the main pancreatic duct, causing pancreatic juice to leak into the retroperitoneum (Figure 8.2) . This complication is called disconnected tail syndrome (DTS) or disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome . Fluid obtained from these complications is typically rich in amylase and lipase . There are no good-quality RCTs addressing the management of DTS . The role of enteral or parenteral nutrition is unclear . Octreotide, a somatostatin analog that inhibits the secretion of pancreatic juice, does not seem to be useful in managing DTS . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography together with pancreatic stenting of the disrupted duct will do little to solve the problem, as a necrotic collection is present and may become infected . In general, the recommended management is endoscopic transmural drainage of the necrotic collection if indicated (see page 67) using a long-term double-pigtail plastic stent . As discussed in Chapter 7 (see page 69), lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) left in place for more than 4 weeks may be associated with bleeding or may become embedded . In cases of partial main pancreatic duct disruption, retrospective data suggest that bridging of the disruption using a transpapillary pancreatic stent may improve outcomes . In refractory cases, distal pancreatectomy or pancreaticojejunostomy may be needed . Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm . AP results in local inflammation and may expose surrounding tissues to pancreatic enzymes . Visceral arteries exposed to inflammation and/or enzymes may develop arteritis and destruction of the vessel wall . The most commonly affected vessels are the intrapancreatic arteries and the splenic and gastroduodenal artery . A case series study found that, overall, 20% of patients diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm due to acute or chronic pancreatitis died . The treatment of choice for pseudoaneurysms due to acute or chronic pancreatitis is selective angiographic embolization . Percutaneous thrombin injection has been described as an alternative to angiography . Surgery is reserved for refractory cases . Peripancreatic vein thrombosis . PVT is associated with local complications of AP because inflammation and local compression of the veins are important prothrombotic factors . PVT is usually an incidental finding on a contrast-enhanced CT scan performed to look for or control pancreatic or peripancreatic collections and necrosis . The splenic vein is the most frequently affected (in 70% of cases), followed by the portal and superior mesenteric veins . The authors' personal experience suggests that early anticoagulation, first (during hospital stay) with low-molecular-weight heparin and then oral anticoagulation for 3-6 months, is safe and may be effective in solving the thrombosis and avoiding left-sided portal hypertension . 
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia . Clinical features . The significant shunting of blood through arteriovenous fistulas is a major concern, leading to cyanosis and paradoxical emboli . The presence of hepatic vascular malformations promotes a hyperdynamic circulation and high-output cardiac failure . Portal hypertension and biliary tract disease have also been reported . Portosystemic encephalopathy occurs when medications or toxic products from blood in the gut bypass the liver and gain access to the systemic circulation . Such shunting may also predispose to brain abscesses . Gastrointestinal bleeding can be quite subtle and stool examination may not reveal occult blood if hemorrhage is intermittent . Upper and lower endoscopy is used to detect and treat the telangiectasias . The diagnostic criteria are shown in Table 3.1 . Iron replacement therapy . Antifibrinolytic agents . Oral estrogens containing norethisterone have been widely used, but may have intolerable side effects . Agents such as danazol and tamoxifen have been effective on occasion . Soy products containing phytoestrogen and genistein, which interferes with the TGFb pathway, have also been considered . There is, however, no single recommended treatment, and none has been subjected to a randomized clinical trial . Hemoglobin concentrations rose in 5 of the patients without additional iron supplementation, and 4 no longer required transfusion support . However, there are only anecdotal accounts and no randomized trials . Local measures to control bleeding . Simple measures such as humidification, saline nasal spray and avoidance of nasal trauma help to prevent bleeding . Giving an antifibrinolytic agent in conjunction with cautery may control hemorrhage . A hit-or-miss strategy is employed in the hope of obliterating the responsible vessels . Ultimately, this results in multiple ligations and excision of large amounts of tissue . Extensive surgical procedures should be a last resort, selected only after failure of more conservative methods . Arteriovenous fistulas and vascular malformations are usually managed by embolic therapy, surgical resection or radiosurgery . Henoch-Schönlein purpura . Children aged 4 to 6 years are most commonly affected, but the disease occasionally appears in adults . The annual incidence is 20.4 per 100 000 . Renal involvement is characterized by a crescentic proliferative glomerulonephritis . In addition, women with a history of even mild renal symptoms were at risk of hypertension or proteinuria during pregnancy . Mixed cryoglobulinemia . Cryoglobulins are complexes of circulating immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold . The cryoglobulins are complexes of monoclonal IgM and polyclonal IgG . Deposition of immune complexes in skin venules is associated with a palpable purpura . The lesions are typically located on the lower legs (Figure 3.4) . The diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy showing hyaline deposits in the venules and cryoglobulin in serum stored at 4°C overnight . Serological tests for hepatitis C antibody or examination of the serum for the presence of hepatitis C RNA will establish the diagnosis . Recently, it was shown that adding the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab to anti-HCV therapy improved outcomes . Several other small trials have confirmed these results . Another novel agent is low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) . IL-2 administration was not associated with adverse effects . Amyloid purpura . Three forms of systemic amyloidosis have been described . Secondary amyloidosis is usually observed in chronic infections, and is distinguished by an increase in serum amyloid A protein . Deposition of this amyloid in blood vessels markedly increases their fragility . In addition to fragile blood vessels, bleeding can be due to a systemic coagulopathy . In one such patient, recombinant human factor VIIa provided effective hemostasis for a major surgical procedure . This last finding suggests that the fibrinolytic system is activated and may be contributing to vascular hemorrhage . Thus, the management of this disorder may be quite complex . 
The clinical trial process may be our most powerful analytical tool for developing and testing new treatments . Bad questions and poor execution defeat the purpose . Characteristics of clinical trials . Although there are regional differences in the extent of informed consent required and its documentation, three fundamental principles apply . The trial must address a legitimate question to which the answer is currently unclear . The patient must be an informed and willing participant in the study . There are four clinical trial structures, each with a different purpose . The Phase I study involves a small number of participants, and provides basic pharmacological and toxicological information . It is not a test of therapeutic efficacy . However, translational research can be performed in conjunction with Phase I testing . Phase I studies are usually not randomized . The Phase II study uses Phase I data to select a range of doses . The sample size is usually 15-20 patients, but may be increased if a major response is observed . The patients usually have end-stage disease, and may have previously received many other drugs . Phase II studies are not usually randomized . The Phase III study is a randomized trial comparing the effects of different treatments, one of which represents the current 'state of the art' . Typical outcome measures are survival, disease-free survival, response, toxicity and quality of life . The Phase IV study is less commonly performed . Its aim is to evaluate the long-term consequences of an established treatment . The UK Department of Health has established a National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) to encourage clinical trial activity . The NCRN can already boast a 7% accrual rate . This mirrors numerous national and regional efforts to accrue patients rapidly and advance clinical science . In Canada, the Canadian National Cancer Institute (NCI/C) is the leading agency . There are similar groups in Australia and Europe . In recent years, even these large organizations have begun to pool efforts globally, both to increase the accrual rate and to advance the generalizability of the result . These clinical research groups are academically based, and closely linked to governmental research agencies . The compounds and strategies being tested come from laboratory research involving both public and private sectors . Generally, the investigational agents are provided by the government or the pharmaceutical company without cost to the patient or institution . Stopping rules . Patient safety is of primary concern in a trial . It is possible that a new treatment may harbor an unanticipated disadvantage or that the treatments compared may have much greater differences in effect than anticipated . Such concerns are addressed by the interim analysis of blinded data, with rules to shut down a trial and make the results public if either of these events occurs . These are not easy systems to design or execute . There is great pressure from all directions to get the data early . The risk is the loss of important long-term information . This issue is particularly important in the adjuvant setting, where much breast cancer research and treatment is concentrated . It is our view that the referring physician, consultant and patient must understand these stopping rules, at least in outline . 'A randomized trial is not necessary for this intervention' . This statement is a poor excuse of the uninitiated . Randomized trials are difficult to run, particularly in the current risk-averse society but they are certainly possible . Unfortunately, many convince themselves otherwise . On the other hand, the process of randomized trials should not distract the clinician scientist from thinking outside the box for reaching new insights . Future of the trials process . The Human Genome Project and the study of derived proteins (proteomics) raise the prospect of ever more precisely engineered drugs . In the USA, a fast-track mechanism for cancer and other 'emergency' diseases has accelerated the introduction of new drugs . The trials process will thus gain even greater importance in the advance of medicine . There will be consequences for every clinician's practice . For example, genetic prediction (exempli gratia BRCA1/2) will lead to proposed interventions before the disease even becomes apparent, and possibly before the early transforming event . Trials will involve large numbers of 'worried well', and will require long follow-up and expanded scrutiny for unintended adverse effects . Another consequence is that target groups will be smaller, so trials will become less centralized, raising questions about quality control and adequate surveillance . 
The initial evaluation of a patient's pain forms the foundation for a rational treatment plan and so it must be as thorough as possible . For patients with chronic pain, this evaluation should include . a general medical history, including a detailed pain history . a psychosocial assessment . For the busy clinician, a handy mnemonic for assessing the patient's pain history and pattern is PQRSTU (Table 2.1) . Many patients with pain due to cancer (see Table 9.1) or other serious illnesses such as HIV/AIDS experience pain from multiple mechanisms, locations and etiologies . Because of the multiple and evolving etiologies of pain, each time a clinician assesses any patient at risk of undertreated pain there must be a fresh evaluation of the pain . Even after an initial pain treatment plan is put in place, the source and severity of a person's pain and the effectiveness of treatment may fluctuate, and therefore their pain should be reviewed and documented at regular intervals . The patient is a key partner in this . When taking the patient's pain history, aspects that should be obtained and recorded in detail include: location, duration, type and intensity of the pain; exacerbating or alleviating factors; previous treatments and response to them; and the meaning of the pain to the patient and their family (Table 2.2) . Pain location . It is helpful to ask patients to identify on a body map the areas where they experience pain (Figure 2.1) . Body pain maps may help classify pain, as in the case of peripheral neuropathic pain with different causes (see Chapter 6) . Pain radiation . Identification of pain radiation, where present, may be of assistance in evaluating the possible source of pain (exempli gratia pain from a compressed spinal nerve may radiate down the leg to the foot or down the arm to the hand) . Pain intensity is the most frequently evaluated dimension of pain . During the titration of analgesics for acute time-limited pain of obvious cause (exempli gratia dental extraction), it may suffice to monitor only pain intensity and forego tracking of other aspects of the multidimensional pain experience . Five types of assessment tool have been commonly used to quantify pain intensity (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) . Patients place a mark on the line at a point that best represents their pain . The numeric rating scale (NRS) may be presented graphically or verbally, with 0 representing 'no pain' and 10 representing 'the worst possible pain' . Patients volunteer a number that best represents their pain intensity . The pain, enjoyment and general activity (PEG) scale, a three-question tool that assesses pain intensity, mood and effects on function, has been validated for use in primary care (see Figure 2.2) . Clinicians often anchor the numeric scale numbers with adjectives denoting levels of both pain intensity and function, giving the numbers consensual meaning between patient and clinician . Patient's perception . We now know that the decrement in pain intensity experienced by an individual relates to that patient's baseline (pretreatment) pain intensity . The more severe the baseline pain, the greater the decrement in VAS or NRS score needed to achieve clinical importance for the patient . The neurological examination should evaluate . The items listed in Table 2.4 should be evaluated . In the case of depressed mood, the clinician should enquire about suicidal ideation, because of the increased risk associated with chronic pain . Psychosocial assessment . The psychosocial assessment should explore the patient's . expectations regarding pain management . Thus, it is important to monitor how pain and its treatment affect function, daily activities, mood, sleep patterns and other aspects of HRQoL . Scales such as the Brief Pain Inventory, which evaluates pain intensity and the effect of pain on mood, sleep, social function and activities, are commonly used to monitor the effects of treatment from visit to visit . Quality-of-life questionnaires specifically designed for patients with chronic non-malignant pain have been developed in an effort to better gauge how pain and pain treatments affect HRQoL . The TOPS is validated in cancer and various chronic pain populations . Assessment for risk of substance abuse . However, there is no 1:1 relationship between imaging findings and pain . Indeed, severe degenerative changes may be present with no accompanying pain and vice versa . 
Genetic predisposition plays a strong part in the clinical manifestation of three types of chronic pancreatitis . hereditary pancreatitis . idiopathic pancreatitis . alcohol-related pancreatitis . Hereditary pancreatitis . Hereditary pancreatitis represents a rare cause of chronic pancreatitis and is associated mostly with mutations in the protease serine 1 (PRSS1) gene . Patients can have severe episodes of acute recurrent pancreatitis, which lead to chronic pancreatitis with calcifications, and possibly exocrine and endocrine insufficiency . The risk of pancreatic cancer in these patients is higher compared with the general population . By the age of 70 years, 60% of patients with hereditary pancreatitis will develop exocrine insufficiency, including all of the expected symptoms of steatorrhea and weight loss . Exocrine and endocrine failure develop in a much higher proportion of patients with hereditary pancreatitis than those with either idiopathic or alcoholic pancreatitis, but the time until failure is longer . About 35% of 70-year-old patients are at risk of pancreatic cancer . Idiopathic pancreatitis . Idiopathic pancreatitis occurs in up to 20% of patients with chronic pancreatitis . Alcohol-related pancreatitis . About 70% of chronic pancreatitis cases are associated with chronic excess alcohol consumption, but fewer than 10% of known alcoholics develop chronic pancreatitis . Whereas cumulative alcohol consumption is directly related to the development of liver cirrhosis, this is not the case in chronic alcohol-related pancreatitis, which appears to be associated with a lower threshold of total alcohol consumed . About 10% of patients develop both liver cirrhosis and chronic pancreatitis . The histological and radiological features of these three types of chronic pancreatitis (hereditary, idiopathic and alcohol-related) are indistinguishable . Inherited abnormal genes play a strong part in the clinical manifestation of the three distinct types of pancreatitis . Mutations of the chymotrypsin C (caldecrin) gene (CTRC) and the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR) are associated with relatively lower increases in risk for chronic pancreatitis . The diagnosis, as with all other types of chronic pancreatitis, will depend on clinical presentation and a combination of functional and imaging investigations . The distinction between hereditary pancreatitis and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis requires a careful family history (Figure 10.2) . For a diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis, there should be at least two first-degree relatives in two or more generations with proven chronic pancreatitis . The detection of a PRSS1 mutation will clinch the diagnosis, but it must be remembered that about 20% of patients do not have a mutation of this gene . Patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis are at high risk of having a CFTR mutation; this may have significant implications for people planning to have children, particularly in areas where there are many carriers of the mutated CFTR gene in the general population . Recurrent acute attacks of pain eventually merge into chronic pancreatitis, with continuous pain and ultimately a steady loss of pancreatic function . The median age for presentation for hereditary pancreatitis is around 12 years, but presentation is earlier in children with an R122H mutation (10 years) than in other patients (15 years) . Most patients present by the age of 20 years and 95% by the age of 50 years . In the absence of a family history, the diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis is commonly missed . The median age for presentation for early-onset idiopathic chronic pancreatitis is 20-30 years, 35-45 years for alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis and 60 years for late-onset idiopathic chronic pancreatitis . The treatment of hereditary pancreatitis is at first identical to that of other forms of chronic pancreatitis . Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking are both independent risk factors for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and should therefore be strongly discouraged . As with other forms of chronic pancreatitis, about 30% of patients will require active intervention by endoscopy and/or surgery because of local pancreatic complications or intractable pain . From the age of 40 years, patients with hereditary pancreatitis should be counseled regarding regular secondary screening for the detection of pancreatic cancer . Discovery of additional genes to explain nearly all cases of hereditary pancreatitis . Improved methods of secondary screening to reduce deaths from pancreatic cancer . 
IgM RF is present in up to 75% of RA patients during the course of their disease, although it may be absent at presentation . In contrast, its presence may predate the onset of RA by several years (see 2 . Its precise role in the pathogenesis of RA is unclear, but it is associated with more aggressive disease and extra-articular manifestations . RF is not specific for RA, but may accompany other autoimmune diseases, various acute and chronic infections and certain malignancies (Table 6.2) . The serum titer of RF does not generally correlate with disease activity, except in patients with vasculitis (see 5 . iii), who tend to have a high titer . Occasionally, an RF is present in serum that precipitates at low temperatures . This is detectable as a cryoglobulin and may be associated with vasculitis and severe Raynaud's phenomenon . Unlike RF, autoantibodies directed at peptides containing the amino acid citrulline are highly specific for RA (>= 95%) . They may also be present many years before symptomatic onset of RA (see Chapter 2), ultimately appearing in a similar proportion of patients as RF . The identification of the ACPA targets that are most closely associated with RA is an area of active research because this should provide clues to etiology and pathogenesis . The relationship between smoking, the shared epitope and the production of ACPA reflects an important gene-environment interaction in the etiology of RA (see Chapter 2) . ACPA and IgM RF are highly associated with each other, particularly in early RA where over two-thirds of ACPA-positive patients are also positive for IgM RF . As with RF the presence of ACPA, particularly when present at high titer, is associated with more aggressive RA . Other autoantibodies may also be present in patients with RA . Anti-nuclear antibodies are present in approximately 40% of RA patients, usually at low titer, and have minimal diagnostic or prognostic value . Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA, usually perinuclear staining [p-]ANCA with specificity for lactoferrin), have been reported in up to 50% of RA patients in some studies . A potential association with more aggressive disease or vasculitis requires confirmation . X-rays are often normal in RA at presentation, or may just show soft-tissue swelling and periarticular osteoporosis around affected joints . The rate of development of these changes varies greatly between patients and depends both on therapy and the aggressiveness of the underlying disease . Earliest changes are usually seen in the hands or feet, and X-rays of the hands, wrists and feet are usually performed at presentation . In the patient with early RA, inflamed synovium appears as a high signal on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images, and enhances further with the paramagnetic contrast agent gadolinium-DTPA . It is also a relatively lengthy procedure, requiring the patient to lie still for a considerable period of time in a semi-enclosed space . This can occur as a complication of the RA disease process or secondary to therapy with corticosteroids . In early RA, it is possible to detect small joint effusions and subclinical synovitis . In addition, bone cortical defects are detectable in patients without X-ray erosions . Synovial fluid examination is not helpful for the diagnosis of RA . This is not uncommon, particularly in the RA patient taking immunosuppressive or biological drugs, and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment . Infection may present as disproportionate inflammation in one or more joints, with or without systemic symptoms, and patients themselves may feel that a distinct process is present in the affected joint . Fluid from acutely inflamed joints secondary to gout or pseudogout may be thick and purulent, whereas fluid from an infected RA joint may appear only slightly cloudy . Monitoring RA . In established RA, investigations are aimed at determining disease activity, documenting damage and monitoring drug therapy . A normochromic normocytic anemia suggests poorly controlled disease, as does a low serum albumin . There is no indication to repeat RF titers or ACPA in a seropositive patient, because they do not necessarily correlate with disease activity, but a seronegative patient may convert to seropositivity during the course of their illness . The assessment of ongoing RA is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 . 
The emergence of new technologies such as gene editing poses additional safety challenges . Virus-related concerns . The administration of viral vectors, in particular when given at high doses in vivo, will lead to shedding of viral particles . However, after extensive studies this risk is now viewed as merely theoretical . Insertional mutagenesis . On reverse transcription of the retroviral RNA genome, the resulting DNA persists through integration into host chromosomal DNA . Retroviral vectors tend to integrate near transcriptionally active promoters and enhancers . Following cell transplant to a total of 20 infants, the clinical outcome was remarkable . Retroviral integration had caused the activation of proto-oncogenes such as LMO2 . Therefore, the trials were suspended and novel vectors with an enhanced safety profile have been developed . At least one example shows that clonal dominance may still occur, even with lentiviral vectors . However, the clone declined in its abundance over time and no malignancy resulted . Potential for immune responses . Neutralizing antibodies . The mammalian immune system has evolved to recognize and fend off pathogens such as viruses . Hence, gene-transfer vehicles such as recombinant viruses are subject to immune responses . Natural infection with AAV starts during childhood, so younger children are less likely to have NAbs to AAV . Alternative methods to eliminate antibodies, such as plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption methods, are also being explored . Innate immunity . The body can rapidly respond to a virus through innate immunity . There are also sensors for endogenous signals that indicate a potential infection such as necrotic cells . Here, administration of anti-inflammatory drugs may be warranted . Reducing vector immunogenicity . Furthermore, CTL responses against proteins expressed by or contained in the vector may occur . Reduced immunogenicity was the main reason for the shift from adenoviral to AAV vectors . Various strategies have been developed to reduce the immunogenicity of gene transfer vectors . MicroRNA targets can be incorporated into transcripts to direct their degradation in antigen-presenting cells . Impact of the underlying mutation . The underlying disease can matter as well . On the other hand, gene transfer also has the potential to induce immune tolerance . A certain level of transgene expression in the liver is typically required . Immune suppression protocols . If immune responses cannot be otherwise prevented, transient immune suppression may be combined with vector administration . Most beneficial are the regimens that do not deplete Tregs, as these are crucial for tolerance to transgene products . Cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity in CAR-T cell therapy . Symptoms include fever, nausea, headache, rash, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure and trouble breathing . Severe reactions are referred to as a 'cytokine storm' . CAR-T cell therapy may also cause neurotoxicity for reasons that are not entirely clear . One initial hypothesis was that the cytokine response alters the blood-brain barrier . However, there is often an inverse relationship between the incidence of CRS and neurotoxicity . Lack of specificity in gene transfer or cell targeting . In other cases, route and dose may be such that off-targeting is very limited . Depending on which non-cancer cells are inadvertently targeted, severe toxicities and even life-threatening situations may arise . Germline gene therapy - a controversial topic . These questions have sparked an ongoing ethical discussion and require answers not only from doctors and scientists but from society as a whole . Nonetheless, a claim was made by a scientist in China in late 2018 that two twin girls were gene edited to become resistant to HIV infection . Although it is not entirely clear that gene editing was indeed achieved, calls for global cooperation and oversight have been made . Moreover, a broader discussion in society of the ethical considerations surrounding the circumstances and goals of human gene editing is warranted . However, one also needs to consider the costs of alternative treatments . Factor-replacement therapy in hemophilia typically costs $200 000-300 000 annually per patient . Healthcare systems and payment policies will need to adjust to these challenges . In developing countries, lifelong treatment of genetic diseases, exempli gratia by protein replacement therapy, is often not available because of a lack of funds . 
As more and more men with prostate cancer survive for longer and longer, 'survivorship' issues are becoming increasingly important . Remember, survivorship years can be some of the best years that patients have . In this respect, those who care for men with prostate cancer can learn a great deal from the teams and charities that treat and support those with breast cancer . Nurses also have a key role in referral of patients to the most appropriate advisory and support services . Erectile dysfunction . Treatment of localized prostate cancer often results in sexual dysfunction . Erectile dysfunction is the most common complaint and can occur after all treatments . Patients must be informed about these consequences before surgery . Loss of libido is a common complaint in patients with prostate cancer . Therapy with an antiandrogen can effectively deprive prostate cancer cells of androgen stimulation without such a profound effect on libido or erectile function . Men with prostate cancer, and their partners, should be counseled not only about probable outcomes, but also about the likely effect of the disease and its therapy on sexual activity . younger age of the patient . These tend to resolve over time but patients should be made aware that EBRT is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer . Prospective clinical trials of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer have highlighted multiple risk factors for bone health and cardiovascular disease, including increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides, insulin resistance, body mass index and fat body mass, and decrease in lean body mass (Table 9.1) . There is currently little evidence to support the use of complementary therapies . There is a suggestion that intermittent ADT may be associated with less fatigue than continuous ADT but this is not currently supported by strong trial evidence . Hemoglobin levels rise slowly after treatment has ended . Transfusions are recommended if hemoglobin is below 10 g/dL in symptomatic men, and in asymptomatic men with comorbidities such as congestive heart failure or cerebral vascular disease . Men may experience gynecomastia and mastalgia (swollen and painful breasts) while using some forms of ADT . The likelihood varies with treatment; the risk is highest in men taking antiandrogens or estrogens . The loss appears to continue indefinitely while treatment continues, and there is no recovery after therapy ceases . Just under 20% of men surviving at least 5 years after a diagnosis of prostate cancer have a fracture if treated with ADT, compared with about 13% of men who do not receive this therapy; this is equivalent to one additional fracture for every 28 men treated with ADT . Further prospective trials are required to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates in men with prostate cancer who require ADT . Until the results from these trials become available, suggestions for the management of bone effects in men receiving ADT include baseline and yearly measurements of BMD . Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk . The first study to report an increase in cardiovascular risk in men treated with ADT was a retrospective study of 79 196 men in whom an increased risk of coronary disease, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmia was identified . Another large retrospective study also suggested a 20% increase in cardiovascular morbidity with 1 year of ADT . reported that, in men over 65 years, treatment with ADT decreased the time to fatal myocardial infarction compared with men not receiving this therapy . As this area is controversial, it is prudent to critically weigh the risks and benefits of ADT in men with cardiovascular risk factors . It is also important to monitor all the risk factors in all men undergoing ADT, and to treat these risk factors where appropriate . ADT alters lipid profiles, potentially increasing cardiovascular risk . Insulin sensitivity is related to testosterone levels; ADT reduces insulin sensitivity . A number of large studies have reported a 19-49% increase in the risk of developing diabetes in men receiving ADT . Waist circumference increases while on ADT, but increased waist to hip ratio and hypertension have not been consistently reported in trials . A detailed medical examination and history should be taken before ADT is started, with particular focus on cardiovascular risk factors . This will enable proactive management before any condition becomes worse as a consequence of ADT . Patients at risk should be advised to make lifestyle changes before and while using ADT: stop smoking, lose weight if necessary, increase physical activity, eat a healthy diet . 
Both the lining layer and the sublining demonstrate characteristic changes on microscopy (Figure 3.2) . Lymphoid follicles may be present, resembling germinal centers of lymph nodes . Neovascularization is dramatic and an essential feature of the hyperplastic sublining layer . As the disease progresses, the nature of the synovium changes . The invading synovium is termed pannus, and the zone of invasion is called the cartilage-pannus junction . Inflammatory mediators . The accumulation of the last of these has been attributed to a form of reperfusion injury within the chronically inflamed joint secondary to elevated intra-articular pressure . The consequent hypoxia is one of a number of stimuli reported to promote neovascularization in rheumatoid synovitis . Cellular infiltrates . These actions contribute to synovial inflammation as well as bone damage and resorption . There is good evidence that autoantibodies such as anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA; see 6 . Homing of cells to synovium . Cardiovascular disease . Therefore, whether enhanced atherosclerosis is purely secondary to RA manifestations or intrinsically linked to its pathogenesis awaits further study . However, cardiovascular complications can occur in early RA, before downstream sequelae such as joint damage . Several lymphocyte subsets - some of which appear to be constitutively activated - resemble those found in elderly individuals . Cartilage and bone destruction . A variety of destructive enzymes are secreted by rheumatoid pannus . These enzymes act upon collagen and the proteoglycan matrix, thereby destroying the central structure of articular cartilage . Osteoimmunology is a relatively new field that studies the interactions between the immune system and bone . Bone destruction in RA is mediated by osteoclasts, which differentiate from monocyte precursors . This is secondary to TNF-induced Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) production, which suppresses Wnt signaling . A further relevant aspect of osteoimmunology relates to the recognition that the synovium can communicate with bone marrow via cortical bone channels . This may partly underlie bone edema present in early RA, which also contributes to periarticular bone loss . Extra-articular disease . None of these sites contains synovial tissue . Histology of rheumatoid nodules reveals pallisading macrophages surrounding a necrotic core, and scattered peripheral lymphocytes . Rheumatoid factor (RF; see 6 . This hypothesis suggests that IgG RFs self-associate head to tail (Figure 3.7) and diffuse into the circulation and subsequently into the tissues . Rheumatoid vasculitis usually occurs in association with high levels of circulating IgM RF, which is highly effective at activating complement . Deposition of IgM RF-containing immune complexes within the perivascular tissues may therefore lead to inflammation and hence vasculitis . Neurological involvement and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis . Intrinsic HPA defects can also be demonstrated in some RA patients in response to conventional pharmacological stimuli . Models of pathogenesis . A number of competing models attempt to consolidate the foregoing features . With their evolutionarily conserved structure from microbes to man, heat shock proteins are also candidate autoantigens . A competing theory states that RA is primarily a disease of FLS . On the other hand, it is equally plausible that abnormal FLS behavior is triggered by chronic autoimmunity and inflammation . The substrate for such an effect is unclear, but the new science of epigenetics could hold the key . Many of the characteristics of the RA FLS could be explained by epigenetic influences of chronic inflammation . Macrophages are also a good biomarker of therapeutic response to a variety of drugs . With the data emerging from GWAS, the autoimmune model appears most robust . Furthermore, the appearance of autoantibodies many years before disease onset (see 2 . iii) also emphasizes immune dysregulation as the primary event in RA . Fibroblast and macrophage abnormalities may then follow as downstream sequelae . A variety of models have been proposed to account for this outcome, each with some experimental support . 
The most common pathologies are stones, infection, nephritis and, in men, prostate enlargement (see 5 . Urinary tract malignancy is rarely seen in patients under 40 years of age . Malignancy is more common in this age group when there is gross hematuria . In taking a history it is important to distinguish hematuria from rectal bleeding, and from vaginal bleeding in women . Urinary tract calculi may present with pain . Glomerulonephritis or nephropathy may occur secondary to a recent upper respiratory tract infection, rash or edema . Bladder tumors classically present with painless frank hematuria . Risk factors for bladder tumors are shown in Table 6.1 . Flow charts for the investigation of hematuria, as recommended in 2001 by the American Urologic Association Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microhematuria in Adults are shown in Figures 6.1 and 6.2 . The incidence of hematuria on microscopy varies from 0.2% to 16.1% in population-based studies . Microscopy can also provide further information about the morphology of the red blood cells . Misshapen red blood cells are usually glomerular in origin, whereas normal red blood cells generally come from the lower urinary tract . Red blood cell casts are almost always associated with glomerular disease . In the case of urine infection, a specimen should be examined after treatment to exclude continuing hematuria . Urine should be tested for proteinuria, which may be a sign of renal pathology or an extrarenal medical disorder . If proteinuria is identified, serum urea, creatinine and electrolytes should be measured . Urine cytology is helpful in the diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma . It is important to note, however, that sensitivity varies from less than 20% to over 90% depending on the tumor grade, sensitivity being lowest for well-differentiated tumors . Ultrasonography of the renal tract is the preferred initial imaging technique for identifying renal parenchymal disease, hydronephrosis and stone fragments . If hydronephrosis is found, the entire renal tract should be investigated . Plain abdominal radiography is useful to detect calcification due to renal tract stones, which affect about 5% of the population . Calcification may also be seen with infection such as tuberculosis, and nephrocalcinosis . It has limited sensitivity for the detection of small renal masses and cannot differentiate between solid and cystic masses . The sensitivity of CT with urographic follow through (CT urography) in detecting urothelial lesions compared with IVU is not yet established . Cystoscopy is recommended for the investigation of hematuria in adults . It allows for accurate detection of mucosal abnormalities and can be performed reliably with a flexible or rigid cystoscope under local anesthesia . It is possible to take bladder biopsies using a flexible cystoscope, although resection requires a rigid cystoscope and general anesthesia . 'One-stop' clinics . In European countries, the investigation of hematuria is often carried out in 'one-stop' clinics with facilities for cytology, ultrasonography and flexible cystoscopy, the aim being to make the diagnosis in a single outpatient visit . The main principles of managing hematuria are as follows . Infections should be managed appropriately . Patients with stones or renal tumors should be referred to the appropriate urologist . Follow-up . Such unexplained hematuria presents a management dilemma . Although most urology specialists/one-stop clinics will discharge these patients, it has been suggested that repeat urinalysis, cytology and blood pressure monitoring is required . Unexplained frank hematuria requires more extensive investigation . For patients with persistent asymptomatic microhematuria with no etiologic findings or associations, one approach is to evaluate them twice, 6 to 12 months apart, and then only if the amount increases or symptoms appear . It can be microscopic or macroscopic (gross), but the investigation for each is similar . The prevalence of hematuria on urine dipstick testing in adults is estimated by various sources to be 2-16% . Dipstick testing is sensitive but is not specific, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between 'physiological' amounts of blood in the urine and blood that is the result of pathology . 
Glioblastoma is the most common intrinsic malignant brain tumor in adults . Specifically, it is a type of infiltrating glioma . Incidence varies widely by histological type, age, sex, race and country . Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor and most common subtype of glioma . It is most common in white men . Glioblastomas are fast growing, and as such have a poor prognosis; indeed, glioblastoma has the worst prognosis of all glioma diagnoses . Likewise, a high socioeconomic status has been associated with glioblastoma diagnosis . Molecular studies have identified key genetic mutations associated with glioblastoma (see page 11) . Glioblastomas are malignant intrinsic tumors that are thought to arise from populations of stem/progenitor cells in the brain (Figure 1.2) . Sometimes tumors that appear to be low grade on histology can have the molecular features of high-grade tumors . In the past, these tumors - which underwent biopsy before the histological high-grade features appeared - were misdiagnosed as low-grade tumors (Figure 1.3b) . High-grade tumors (WHO grades III and IV) are more cellular and have mitotic figures and greater variability in nuclear shape and size ('pleomorphic') . Classification by genetic mutation . The recognition of genetic mutations has largely superseded the importance of histological appearance in the classification of glioblastomas (see Figure 1.3) . The key mutations and tumor subtypes are described below; Table 1.1 (see page 16) summarizes the molecular subtypes, their mutations, locations and age distributions . Mutations in the IDH gene were identified in 2008 as an early event in glioma development . More than 95% of mutations occur at codon R132 of the IDH1 gene . The remaining 5% occur at codon R172 of the IDH2 gene . However, IDH mutations are rarely found in adult intrinsic (primary) glioblastomas or pediatric glioblastomas . Several studies have shown that glioblastomas with an IDH gene mutation are associated with better prognosis than IDH wild-type glioblastomas (id est glioblastomas with normal IDH genes) . IDH wild-type glioblastoma is the most common form of glioblastoma . These tumors can occur in adults of any age, but arise most commonly in individuals of 50-70 years old . Precursor forms of IDH wild-type glioblastoma present on MRI as hyperperfused low-grade diffuse gliomas and do not show high-grade histological features (see Figure 1.3) . Historically, these tumors were diagnosed as astrocytomas . These precursor forms carry the same mutations as glioblastoma and can therefore be considered as early manifestations of these tumors . IDH- mutant glioblastomas are less common, occurring at 5-10% of the frequency of IDH wild-type glioblastomas . The ATRX mutation results in loss of expression in tumor cell nuclei, which can be seen on histological sections (see Table 1.1) . Posterior fossa tumors are exceptionally rare . These occur in low- and high-grade forms; the latter may have similar histological features to glioblastoma . Loss of heterozygosity 1p/19q does not occur in glioblastoma . This mutation results in abnormal chromatin remodeling and has a distinct gene expression profile . They have non-specific histological features and do not always have high-grade features; nevertheless, the WHO 2016 classification categorizes them as grade IV tumors . Histone H3.3 G34R/V-mutant glioblastoma is very rare . The H3.3 G34R mutation is biologically distinct from the K27M mutation . Often, these high-grade BRAF -mutated gliomas also carry mutations in the CDKN2A/B genes . BRAF V600E-mutated tumors have a predilection for the temporal lobe . Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation in glioma cells occurs in about 50% of glioblastomas, increasing chemosensitivity . 
In fact, many clinicians do so without realizing, by simply providing good advice in a logical ordered fashion . Other suggestions might include putting the biscuits where they are difficult to reach, or to have healthy snacks readily accessible instead . Alternatively, there may be other ways to unwind: such as having a bath or going for a run . In short-term studies, it has been shown to induce weight loss of 10% or more but this was not sustained in the long term . 'Stage of change' theory . Before starting treatment it is important to determine which stage the individual is at and to act accordingly; success is unlikely if the wrong approach is made at the wrong time . The six stages are shown in Figure 7.1 . Elements of behavioral therapy . Goal setting: the agreement of realistic weight-loss targets, at a realistic rate of improvement . Stimulus control: avoiding situations that lead to harmful behavior, and promoting situations that influence healthy activity . Problem solving: how to avoid social and societal pressures that might result in straying from agreed goals and targets . Cognitive restructuring: identifying and modifying self-defeating thoughts and ideas . Many of these techniques are summarized in Table 7.1 . Self-monitoring is a fundamental pillar of CBT; in its most basic form it constitutes a food and activity diary that records . what is eaten . where the food is eaten, and in what circumstances . emotional feelings or triggers involved . levels of activity . Once the pattern of eating has been established, the diary can be used as part of the treatment plan, by recording progress towards dietary goals . Long-term weight management has been shown to improve when food records are used . Stimulus control . External cues include . time (exempli gratia eating because its lunchtime) . social situations (exempli gratia eating cheese with port because everyone else is) . Stimulus control might involve avoiding external cues, for instance taking a different route home that avoids passing the temptation of a fast-food outlet . Avoiding shopping whilst hungry is another example of stimulus control . Internal cues include stress or emotional eating (discussed below) . 'Learned self-control' becomes important when the only route home passes the fast-food outlet, making external temptation unavoidable . Learned self-control occurs with prolonged repetition of the external stimulus, without giving in and eating . After enough journeys home without buying food, the conditioned response will be reduced . Patients are supported to develop the ability to recognize potential solutions to their problems rather than solutions being suggested by the patient's healthcare practitioner . The process is outlined in Table 7.2; the skills developed are transferable to solving a range of problems . However, evidence for hyperphagia in a stressful environment is conflicting, as for some individuals stress causes loss of appetite . This amounts to eating without relying on the usual stimulus of hunger to govern when food is required . Others admit to 'bingeing' on energy-dense foods when commonsense tells them to stop but they feel powerless to resist . These phenomena may arise from common pathways in the brain that relate to satiety and mood; the underlying stress or depression must be confronted for weight loss to be successful . Eating disorders . The condition was largely ignored when it was first recognized in 1959 but has recently gained greater prominence . Diagnostic criteria are loss of control of eating plus three of . eating much more rapidly than normal . eating until uncomfortably full . eating large amounts when not physically hungry . eating alone because of embarrassment of volume of consumption . feeling disgusted, depressed or very guilty afterward . The prevalence among patients attending obesity clinics is 20-30%, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the condition without delay . Treatment involves conventional weight management combined with CBT . Strict dietary regimens are likely to aggravate the condition and should be avoided . Depression and personality disorders have been linked with BED but it is unclear whether the abnormal eating pattern predates the emotional disorder or vice versa . Criteria are shown in Table 7.3 . Treatment is predominantly behavioral rather than dietary, initially by persuading patients to have an early substantial breakfast and to regain a normal eating pattern . The circadian rhythm should be reinforced by the appropriate amount of exercise during the day, with normal regular mealtimes and daily routines . 
The next step is to make the definitive diagnosis . Multiparametric MRI . Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI involves imaging the prostate during rapid infusion of gadolinium contrast . Prostate cancer is detected based on early enhancement and early wash-out (resulting from the greater vascularity due to increased angiogenesis) . This modality can also give an indication of the aggressiveness of the cancer, as highly aggressive tumors show poorer diffusion of water . Furthermore, nine out of 10 men (89%) who had a negative mpMRI scan did not have a cancer, or had a harmless cancer . Prostate biopsy . The advent of mpMRI has changed significantly the way in which prostate biopsies are performed . Usually 12-18 TRUS-guided biopsies are taken from different regions of the prostate using an 18-gauge needle . This transperineal technique allows extended sampling of the gland, but requires general anesthesia and is associated with a small but significant risk of urinary retention . Cognitive targeted biopsy . This technique does not require special equipment or training, but small lesions may be missed . However, a prospective trial found that this technique did not provide any substantial improvement in accuracy over cognitive biopsy . Ultrasound-guided biopsy . Assessment of local staging by TRUS imaging alone is poor . When extracapsular or seminal vesicle extension is suspected on imaging, a biopsy of the suspicious area is required for confirmation . Staging of localized disease . Staging of localized disease relies on the following techniques . PSA measurement . CT scanning . radionuclide bone scan . PET/CT (with PSMA [prostate-specific prostate antigen] ligand or choline) . Digital rectal exam has an accuracy for staging prostate cancer of only 30-50% . Prostate-specific antigen determination . However, the correlation is poorer in individual patients because of the considerable overlap between the PSA ranges associated with different stages . A negative scan also serves to reassure a patient that his skeleton is not involved . Identification of extracapsular extension or invasion into the seminal vesicles depends on the identification of regions of low signal intensity in the normally bright periprostatic fat and seminal vesicles . It may, however, depend on more subtle changes, such as asymmetry of the neurovascular bundles, irregular gland margins or capsular obliteration . MRI provides little advantage over CT in the evaluation of nodal metastases . Staging of metastatic disease involves assessing the extent of bone and soft tissue involvement . CT of the abdomen and pelvis may be used to inform treatment decisions that depend on the presence and degree of lymph node or other soft tissue involvement . Small-volume and microscopic metastases (< 1 cm) are not usually detected by this technique, however, and the accuracy of CT scanning is only 40-50% . CT scanning may also be used occasionally to guide fine-needle aspiration of enlarged lymph nodes for cytological analysis to aid diagnosis . PET/CT scanning . Prognostic tables and nomograms . Many of these nomograms are available on the web or as an app, such as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's pretreatment nomogram () . Other nomograms have been developed to predict the likelihood of recurrence of cancer after radical prostatectomy, external-beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy . Simpler prediction tools, such as Partin's tables, predict the likely pathology from PSA values, Gleason score and clinical stage . These readily available clinical predictors are useful for patient counseling and planning treatment such as surgery or radiotherapy . Three of the most developed tests are described below . Prolaris ® (Myriad Genetics) is a genomic 'risk stratification' test that can provide additional prognostic information to the clinical picture . It quantifies the RNA expression of 31 genes involved in tumor cell division, plus 15 'housekeeping' genes that allow standardization of the test . Low expression of these genes is associated with a low risk of cancer progression, and vice versa . This test can be used to counsel patients and guide therapeutic options after prostate biopsy and after radical prostatectomy . Summary of diagnostic and staging options . An approach to the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer is outlined in Figure 4.6 . 
Physiology of normal pancreatic function . The pancreas is an organ with important exocrine and endocrine functions, including being the main source of digestive enzymes . The exocrine pancreas consists of acinar and ductal cells (Figure 1.1) . Pancreatic acinar cells secrete inactive digestive enzymes (zymogens) in order to protect the pancreas from self-digestion . Trypsin is a key pancreatic enzyme and is secreted as a zymogen called trypsinogen . Once in the duodenum, an enterocyte apical membrane enzyme called enterokinase converts pancreatic trypsinogen to trypsin by limited proteolysis of its eight-amino-acid-long N-terminal activation peptide (Figure 1.2) . Trypsin then activates other molecules of trypsinogen as well as other zymogens into active enzymes . Pancreatic ductal cells secrete water and bicarbonate, which neutralize gastric acid and help to flush pancreatic enzymes into the duodenum . Endocrine cells (clustered into the islets of Langerhans) are scattered along the exocrine tissue, and hormones such as insulin interact with acinar cells to further regulate exocrine secretion . However, the initial step in the pathogenesis of AP is acinar cell injury, which has several important consequences (Figure 1.3) . Altered calcium signaling . Altered calcium signaling is associated with destabilization of the secretory zymogen granules and intracellular activation of trypsinogen to trypsin . When an injured cell becomes necrotic, it releases substances that activate inflammation, including so-called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) . DAMPs induce local inflammation and may also be associated with systemic inflammation . Acinar cell injury is associated with the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B, which in turn induce the secretion of proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules . These substances are involved in immune cell recruitment to the damaged tissue: neutrophils, monocytes and other cells infiltrate the pancreas and produce inflammation . Proinflammatory cytokines greatly contribute to systemic toxicity . Autophagy blockade appears to be another important step in the pathogenesis of AP . The initial injury to the acinar cells can block this process of autophagy, leading to trypsinogen activation, cell death and inflammation . The exact mechanisms underlying the relationship between autophagy and pancreatitis are subject to ongoing research . Premature intrapancreatic activation of zymogens Altered calcium signaling, inflammation, altered autophagy and genetic mutations in certain proteins (see page 19-22) are associated with intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen to trypsin . In turn, trypsin can activate other zymogens in a cascade reaction that leads to mitochondrial malfunction, cell necrosis and direct self-digestion of the pancreas and its surroundings . AP is a heterogeneous disease . Two-thirds of patients will develop a mild and uneventful disease characterized by pancreatic edema (classically termed edematous pancreatitis) and little or no systemic inflammatory response . However, the remaining one-third of patients will develop local and/or systemic complications . Pancreatic gland necrosis results from massive cellular injury mediated by the mechanisms described above and also from damage to the pancreatic microvasculature caused by inflammation . Peripancreatic fat necrosis arises when the fat surrounding the pancreas is affected by inflammation and digestion by pancreatic lipase . These local complications are frequently associated with pain, systemic inflammation, fluid sequestration and sometimes with compression of neighboring structures, leading to intolerance of an oral diet, thrombosis of peripancreatic veins, jaundice or infection . Infection is the consequence of early bacterial translocation due to a loss of the barrier function of the bowel: bacteria reach regional lymph nodes, the splanchnic vein system and then the necrotic tissue . Necrotizing pancreatitis (pancreatic gland and/or peripancreatic fat necrosis) is also associated with a higher risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome leading to organ failure due to uncontrolled and unbalanced release of proinflammatory mediators . 
Sites of metastatic disease . Although metastases normally invade multiple organs, 5% may present as a solitary metastasis . Brain metastases are not uncommon and, as patients survive longer, are becoming an increasing clinical challenge . blood tests (full blood count and biochemistry including calcium) . computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen (+- pelvis) . isotope bone scan . Treatment options . Aims of treatment . Conventionally, metastatic breast cancer is incurable . It is important to have a clear view of the aim of treatment . Patient outcomes . In an individual patient, the best predictor of outcome is previous response . Endocrine therapy . Some premenopausal women may be offered tamoxifen . In postmenopausal women . Options include . a steroidal aromatase inhibitor (exemestane; see below) . Tamoxifen as second-line therapy . The data available have shown that it remains helpful . Addition of mTOR inhibitor to steroidal aromatase inhibitor . Systemic chemotherapy . Many cytotoxic drugs have activity in breast cancer . At this stage, palliation is of increasing importance . Targeted therapy . HER2-targeted therapy . It is seen in 25% of breast cancers and is associated with an inferior prognosis . Response rates are high, with a 50-60% improvement in overall survival of around 7 months . Cardiac monitoring is necessary because of the potential fall in left ventricular ejection fraction . Lapatinib is an oral dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signaling downstream of HER2 . Other anti-HER2 agents . Vascular endothelial growth factor . Other drugs targeting tumor vasculature are undergoing clinical trials . Other new agents . Triple-negative breast cancer . TRN breast cancers have a predilection to metastasize to the liver and brain . TRN breast cancers may be more sensitive to chemotherapy, especially platinum-based drugs and taxanes . Management of disease at individual sites . Surgery may be possible after systemic treatment . Locoregional radiotherapy is recommended for all patients . The tumor involves the dermal lymphatics, and lymph-node and distant metastases are common . An isotope bone scan with plain radiographs can be used to identify bone destruction . MRI will determine the cause of any neurological symptoms . Management is outlined in Table 8.4 . This should be followed by radiotherapy . In clinical trials, bisphosphonates delay skeletal-related events, such as pain and fracture . Care should be taken to ensure normal renal function, and to adjust both dose and infusion rate if abnormalities arise . If hypercalcemia is refractory to bisphosphonates, then calcitonin may be considered . Corticosteroids have limited use . Pleural and pericardial effusions . Pericardial effusions can be drained under imaging control, but may require a pericardial window . Lymphedema may occur at any time after primary diagnosis . Proactive management will minimize morbidity . Management includes avoiding and treating arm infections, compression sleeves, massage and bandaging . Liver metastases . Corticosteroids may relieve liver capsular pain . Neurological complications . Solitary metastases should be considered for resection before radiotherapy . Palliative care and terminal disease . Pain is often widespread, and may have several causes . Each site and cause of pain should be identified to allow the most effective analgesic to be given . Laxatives should be given concomitantly to prevent constipation . Insomnia and anxiety can be relieved with benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or diazepam . Also see Fast Facts: Chronic and Cancer Pain . Spiritual and emotional support . It is essential that healthcare professionals recognize the need for spiritual and emotional support for the dying patient . Coming to terms with the inevitability of death may have a calming influence and may even reduce the need for pharmacological support . 
Fibroadenomas, however, may also appear as single hard lumps . Typically, breast cancers are about 2 cm in diameter by the time they become large enough to palpate . The most common cause is the normal periodic pain during the menstrual cycle (cyclic mastalgia) . However, pain does not exclude a cancer . In postmenopausal women, discharges from the nipple that are not bloodstained are usually due to duct ectasia . Persistent discharge from a single duct in the nipple needs to be investigated, especially if a dipstick is positive for blood . Skin involvement . In advanced cases, the tumor may involve the skin, leading to ulceration (Figure 4.1) . Blockage of the lymphatic circulation can cause lymphedema, resulting in swelling of the arm . This is a late sign of cancer (stage T4) . Lymph nodes . It is, however, rare for a woman to present with metastatic disease . When to refer? . The following patient groups can be managed, at least initially, by the primary care physician . An 'index of suspicion' remains the paramount principle . A suspicious mass with negative mammographic findings warrants biopsy . Negative biopsy findings in such a patient should be reviewed for anatomic and histopathological accuracy . Triple assessment . A standard 'breast history' includes . a menstrual, obstetric and gynecologic history . the family history of breast and ovarian cancer . a drug history, including use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy . previous and concurrent diseases and surgery . The color and site of discharge should be noted and tested for the presence of blood . Discharge from a single duct is usually due to a duct papilloma . The likelihood of finding carcinoma is about 1% . Distinguishing discrete lumps from areas of nodularity in a relatively young woman can be difficult . Ultrasound can provide reassurance if it fails to detect any localized abnormality . Magnetic resonance imaging . It produces remarkable digitized images that allow three-dimensional reconstruction of the breast (Figure 4.5) . However, an experienced radiological and surgical team is needed to interpret the images appropriately . This clearly ignores evidence from the clinical trials of the past, which point to the safety of breast-conserving techniques . This appears to be more likely if the woman is having a reconstruction . Such aspiration will provide immediate relief and reassurance . Experienced cytopathologists can diagnose breast cancer with almost 100% specificity . The clinical and imaging findings should also be concordant . As there is less sampling error, the false-negative rate is reduced to a very low level . Open biopsy involves the removal of the entire lump under general anesthesia . Metastatic spread . If the tumor is large and there is extensive lymph-node involvement, preoperative staging is required . MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) are sometimes used for staging indeterminate lesions . Furthermore, the reduction in younger women was not statistically significant, and was delayed by at least 8 years . This is an ongoing controversy . It is worth noting that consumer advocacy groups also hold this viewpoint . Screening programs for breast cancer are associated with a number of problems . Only about 70-80% of women accept mammography . It is much lower in some areas . Of all the cancers diagnosed, over 50% are diagnosed between screening mammograms . False-positive results are obtained in about 1% of mammograms . Such results could generate unnecessary anxiety, particularly if further investigations are undertaken . This risk is, however, low . Furthermore, there is good evidence that screening leads to overdiagnosis . The optimum interval between mammograms has not been determined . However, a shorter interval would have major cost implications . This substantial effect should not be underestimated . In these trials, compliance with the instructions was very high and could not be the reason for the absence of benefit . In 2001, the Canadian Medical Association went one step further when it published new guidelines following a systematic review of the literature . The controversy has deep roots . This can be done by feeling the breasts with a soapy hand while washing . 
Airway development and lung function . The conducting airways are fully developed by 16 weeks' gestation . Alveolar size continues to increase with lung growth . Risk factors . While cigarette smoking, itself now regarded as a disease, is the major risk factor, COPD also occurs in non-smokers and individuals vary greatly in their susceptibility to smoke . Cigarette smoking is the most important etiologic factor for the development of COPD . There is, however, considerable individual variation . Some non-smokers, for example, have impaired lung function . Approximately 20% of patients with COPD are lifelong non-smokers . It is likely that smoking contributes to the development of COPD in several distinct ways and at several different periods over the lifespan of the individual (Table 2.1) . Furthermore, the adverse effects of smoking on lung function are likely to be greater the earlier an individual is exposed . Exposure to other substances, including indoor and outdoor pollution, can also contribute to the development of COPD . Passive exposure to cigarette smoke is an important risk factor and may contribute to the development of COPD in non-smokers . Individuals exposed to dusts and fumes who also smoke cigarettes have the highest risk of developing COPD . Smoke may also alter the ability of the lungs to self-repair . Heterogeneous susceptibility . The complex interactions between cigarette smoke and the lungs of smokers suggest multiple steps at which individual susceptibility may vary . Consistent with this, smokers show considerable heterogeneity in their susceptibility to developing COPD and strong genetic components appear to be present . Both smoking and non-smoking siblings of individuals with established COPD are at greatly increased risk of lower lung function than are siblings of individuals without COPD . It is likely that a number of specific genetic factors will affect susceptibility to COPD (see pages 27 -) . Such occupational exposures contribute to 10-20% of the symptom or functional impairment in COPD . Low maximal attained lung function increases the risk of excessive loss of lung function in later life . Not surprisingly, a variety of early life events can increase the risk for the development of COPD, presumably by affecting lung growth and development . Some childhood infections have been reported both to reduce lung function in adulthood and to increase the risk of pulmonary symptoms . Interestingly, these infections may affect lung function in several ways . In addition to acutely altering lung growth and development, some infections may have direct effects in later life . Such expression may predispose individuals to inflammation and lung damage in later life . Low socioeconomic status is also a risk factor for the development of COPD and may reflect the association with risk factors such as smoking, occupational exposures and respiratory infections . Airway hyperreactivity is also a risk factor for the development of COPD . The fact that asthma is characterized by increased airway reactivity and individuals with increased reactivity have a greater risk of developing COPD suggests a link between asthma and COPD . Chronic bronchitis or mucus hypersecretion is associated with increased FEV decline; younger adult smokers with chronic bronchitis have an increased risk of COPD . Genetic factors . There is a significant familial risk of airflow limitation in smoking siblings of patients with severe COPD, suggesting that genetic factors influence the development of the condition (Table 2.2) . People deficient in alpha1-proteinase inhibitor are at increased risk of developing COPD even if they do not smoke, although not all affected individuals develop disease . If such individuals smoke, they are much more likely to develop severe COPD and to develop it at a particularly early age (Figure 2.3) . However, only some non-smokers with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency develop emphysema . Some maintain normal lung function throughout life . This indicates the importance of other factors . Additional genetic associations that may contribute to COPD risk and that are more common than alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency have been identified, although these are likely to increase the risk of COPD only modestly . Inhibition of tissue repair may contribute to the development of COPD alongside the mechanisms that augment tissue destruction . Many individuals with seemingly stable COPD often deteriorate if they develop a severe and prolonged intercurrent illness . Other factors such as exacerbations seem to be more important in driving health status, particularly in severely affected individuals . Many people who are developing COPD control dyspnea on exertion by decreasing their level of effort . 
Chronic plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) accounts for approximately 85% of all cases of psoriasis . Most patients develop clinical signs of psoriasis before the age of 35 years and about 10% of patients develop the condition during childhood . There is no specific blood test for psoriasis . Clinical manifestations . Shape of lesions . Associated ankle edema is common . Recent studies have indicated that pustular forms of psoriasis may be genetically distinct from chronic plaque psoriasis . This fits well with the intermittent nature of the disease and the poorer response of pustular forms to standard treatments . Sites of disease involvement . Secondary candidiasis in body folds can also modify psoriasis, as can concurrent disease such as HIV infection, which frequently results in a more inflammatory form of psoriasis, often with severe facial involvement . Involvement of the face is not uncommon . Involvement of the umbilicus and natal cleft is common . Two main forms of psoriasis occur on the hands and feet . The palmar surface (Figure 2.10) and sides of the fingers are frequently involved . Genitalia are frequently involved (Figure 2.11) . The pubic region is often involved in both sexes . Direct extension of disease from the natal cleft may involve perianal skin and cause pruritus ani . Involvement of the nails can take several forms, as described below . Patients with significant nail disease have a higher propensity for developing psoriatic arthritis . Comorbidities in psoriasis . It is becoming increasingly clear that a multitude of diseases is associated with psoriasis . This observation has strong clinical implications and suggests that the management of patients with psoriasis should take into account factors other than the severity of the skin disease . Psoriatic joint disease . Five major patterns of psoriatic arthritis are recognized, with overlapping clinical expressions frequently seen in individual patients . Patients with the most common form - distal interphalangeal joint disease - frequently have concomitant nail disease, localized to the same digits as the joint disease . Other organ-specific autoimmune diseases . The association between psoriasis and Crohn's disease is recognized both clinically and genetically . (For more information on Crohn's disease see Fast Facts: Inflammatory Bowel Disease . The association between psoriasis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and uveitis is also recognized . Cancer has been a key issue in psoriasis and its management for some time . What has not been clear is whether psoriasis itself is a risk factor for malignancy or whether the excess risk of various cancers in patients with psoriasis is a result of its treatment . Two cancers are associated with psoriasis: lymphoma and skin cancer, predominantly non-melanoma skin cancer . Both these cancers are more common in patients with moderate and severe disease than in those with mild disease . Lymphoma is approximately twice as common in the psoriasis population compared with the general population . Thus, the evidence tends to suggest that the cancer risk relates to the treatment rather than the disease per se . Metabolic syndrome describes a number of clinical features that together largely explain the excess risk of cardiovascular and liver disease in patients with psoriasis . Furthermore, the individual components of the metabolic syndrome are known to be overrepresented in patients with psoriasis . Recent studies show that obesity is much more common in patients with psoriasis, particularly if they have severe disease . Furthermore, the association starts at an early age, with obese children being shown to have more psoriasis whatever the severity . Studies in young adults have also shown that as weight increases so does the prevalence of psoriasis . Cardiovascular disease . Over the past decade there has been increasing realization of a definitive link between psoriasis and cardiovascular disease . Epidemiological studies indicate that cardiovascular disease is more common in patients with psoriasis, and traditional risk factors such as hypertension and obesity also have an increased incidence in these patients (see above) . Furthermore, mortality from cardiovascular disease is 2.6-fold greater in patients with moderate and severe psoriasis than in the general population . The adverse effect of psoriasis on quality of life has been well documented and is regarded as an important indication for treating patients with the disease . 
Trial endpoints . Biosimilar oncologics face a challenge of confidence given that the aim of curative treatment is the absence of disease . For originator drugs, the pivotal trial endpoints were disease-free survival and overall survival rates 5 years after treatment . Critically, the PD endpoints for biosimilars are usually surrogate rather than clinical results . For rituximab biosimilars, some manufacturers have submitted trial data mainly from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, with only small confirmatory trials in lymphoma . This makes sense from a regulatory perspective: the mechanism of action is the same (the clearance of circulating B-cells) and toxicity issues are identical (infection due to immunosuppression) . Furthermore, testing for immunogenicity, in patients with the heightened immune state characteristic of rheumatoid disease, is more likely to identify differences than testing in patients with lymphoma or leukemia, who are immunosuppressed due to concomitant immunosuppressive chemotherapy . Whilst regulators are familiar with the issues of extrapolating data between diseases, surveys show that this is the principle barrier to clinician confidence in the use of rituximab biologics . Trial settings . Mylan and Biocad submitted overall response rates in metastatic breast cancer . Amgen and Pfizer used the pathological complete response rate after neo-adjuvant induction concomittant chemotherapy and biologic therapy . Celltrion performed phase III PD trials in both settings . Regulators accept that such a difference is unlikely to create any clinically meaningful difference in safety or efficacy . Furthermore, functional assays of biopotency, binding kinetics, binding specificity to VEGF-A versus other VEGF family members, and Fc binding activities all showed equivalence . Such differences in glycan composition can result in different immune profiles, which could be critical to interchangeability . However, bevacizumab has low immunogenicity, and an immune response is even less likely to be associated with its use in patients receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy for cancer . This equivalence is reassuring for oncologists, although there are concerns regarding the unlicensed use of bevacizumab-ABP215 in ophthalmology . Bevacizumab is very similar to ranibizumab, another inhibitor of VEGF, which is licensed for the treatment in retinal age-related wet macular degeneration (wet-AMD) . As the cost per injection of bevacizumab for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is about 12 times lower than that for ranibizumab, there is significant unlicensed use of bevacizumab in this indication . Institutions such as the US Veterans Affairs and the UK National Health Service have endorsed this use based on these findings . It can be argued that the eye is an immune-privileged site, such that anti-drug antibodies are unlikely to be a problem; however, ocular immune privilege is not absolute and its mechanisms are still not completely understood . Such issues cannot be assessed by the drug regulators as use in wet-AMD is unlicensed . Problems such as this have previously been resolved by large-scale clinical studies, which will probably be required in this context, before ABP215 can be used in this unlicensed setting . Confusion, stemming from differences in trial design, is compounded by the desire of competing manufacturers to create differentiation between biosimilars of the same drug . In contrast, biologics and biosimilars are deemed by regulators to be either equivalent or not equivalent - a binary decision, with analytics being the dominant driver of the decision . Formulary decisions about the choice of biosimilar would then be driven by price and convenience, as is the case for generic drugs . This offers little opportunity to claim technical superiority of one biosimilar over another, as all versions of a drug will have been determined comparable . Only in the USA is there potential for brand differentiation between biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars (see page 31), although this is not expected until after 2019, long after this class of drugs will have been launched . Different clinical trial designs therefore offer an opportunity for drug manufacturers to make claims of superiority of one trial approach over another that are of no interest to the regulator . The regulator requires only that equivalence has been shown in a suitably sensitive PD endpoint . 
Timing of biosimilar development . Original reference medicines are protected at launch by patent law and laws on data exclusivity that prevent potential generic and biosimilar drug developers from relying on the originator's test data submitted for marketing approval when seeking such approval for its own product . The manufacturers of original reference drugs are frequently accused of 'evergreening' to delay competition - maintaining data exclusivity through the introduction of minor changes to a product, such as a change to the dosing schedule from twice to once a day, which can potentially extend monopolies for years . This has particularly affected biosimilar development in the USA, where originators have tried to protect monopoly status well beyond the patent expiry of the drug itself through the creation of a 'patent thicket' of often dozens of secondary legal blocks to competitors . The first appearance of such tactics in biosimilar development was in 2015, when an originator biologic manufacturer described publicly its strategy: it listed 22 patents for various diseases or methods of treatment, 14 on the drug's formulation, 24 on its manufacturing practices and 15 other patents . The impact was to prolong US monopoly patent protection up to 2034 - while biosimilar versions of the same drug were approved and marketed in Europe by 2018 . Biosimilar manufacturers have reacted in two ways: some companies have agreed with the reference drug maker to extend US patent protection until 2023, while one company is launching a legal attack on this policy . Third parties have become involved; a trade union has launched a case against both the reference drug maker and those who have settled to delay the launch of competition, while Senators on the Finance and Judiciary Committees look to change the controlling legislation . 3 Who wins this legal debate will affect dramatically US biosimilars policy over the next few years . Development in the USA . Patent law is not the only difference affecting biosimilar development in Europe and the USA . In America, the first copies of biological reference drugs were approved through the abbreviated new drug application pathway as generics - human growth hormone Omnitrope (Sandoz) in 2006 and Enoxaparin-M-Enoxaparin (Momenta/Sandoz) in 2010 . Without the regulatory description of 'biosimilar', the US versions of these drugs did not attract the negative position statements of clinician associations that were seen in Europe, nor was there a required understanding of this process at the time . Further biosimilar approvals then stalled until new legislation was passed to create a separate biosimilars approval pathway under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) defined a biosimilar as a biological product highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and with no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product . However, it also stipulated extending data exclusivity for original reference drugs to 12 years and creating controversial disclosure requirements on biosimilar makers . The scientific steps to approval in the USA are directly analogous to those in Europe . However, the US regulator in 2010 signaled an intention to further designate some biosimilars 'interchangeable biosimilars'; this subclass has regulatory approval for potential brand substitution by dispensing pharmacists . For a biosimilar to be designated as interchangeable, proof is required that it will have the same expected clinical results in any given individual patient . Furthermore, if the medicine is administered more than once, the 'interchangeable' product should demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy when switching between the biosimilar and the reference product . Within the USA, there can be state laws that govern how a medicine can be used . For biosimilars, this is principally ruling on the substitution of brands by pharmacists . Similar rulings were placed in the era when generic medicines were being introduced, and one of the key historic roles of pharmaceutical benefit schemes in the USA was to overturn many local state restrictions to create today's competitive American medicines market . Development in Europe . Europe has a specific legal problem, with one central regulator shared between 31 nations . Biosimilars are approved by the supranational European Medicines Agency, while patent laws can be national . As dates of patent filing may differ across the 31 nations, dates of expiry will differ as well . This explains the European need for 'bioidentical' drug brands for different nations - identical medicines sold under different brand names with different approved indications (some examples are listed in Table 4.1) . No such need for bioidentical medicines is required in the USA as one patent office and one regulator covers the same territory .

Psoriasis is a common chronic, disfiguring inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 3% of the population . Several clinical variants exist (see Chapter 2) of which chronic plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) is the most common form (85-90% of all cases) . However, psoriasis can occur at any age, including childhood (often signifying a more severe clinical course) and old age . Types of psoriasis . Two types of chronic plaque psoriasis have been described, based on age of onset, association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and disease course . Affected individuals tend to have more severe disease that runs a more irregular course . In these individuals, a positive family history is very uncommon and the disease tends to be mild and localized . Psoriasis severely affects a patient's quality of life in terms of both psychological and physical well-being . Studies comparing psoriasis with other important chronic diseases have shown that the impact of psoriasis on the patient's quality of life is at least as great as that of ischemic heart disease, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Psoriasis is therefore a disease of major socioeconomic importance; in the USA alone, the annual cost to society has been estimated at US$3.5 billion . Furthermore, there is increasing evidence of an association between psoriasis and important comorbidities including cardiovascular and psychiatric disease; evidence suggests that patients with moderate and severe disease have a high mortality due to cardiovascular events (see Chapter 2) . In the UK, although most patients with psoriasis have relatively mild disease, evidence suggests that 30% require second-line treatment (phototherapy or systemic medication) that involves referral to a dermatologist and that perhaps 40% of all dermatology inpatients have psoriasis . In the USA, where inpatient dermatology care is rarely available, and at many institutions in the UK, specialized psoriasis day centers have evolved for patients with moderate-to-severe disease . The advent of new treatments has greatly improved the outlook for many patients, particularly those with severe disease . The pathogenesis of psoriasis can be described in terms of three inter-related phases (Figure 1.1) . the interplay between environmental and genetic factors . The validity of this statement has been borne out by population and family studies and research in twins, all of which suggest an important genetic component to the disease . For example, in terms of types I and II psoriasis (see page 7), approximately 80% of patients with type I psoriasis are positive for the HLA-Cw6 gene, compared with only 20% of those with type II psoriasis . Approximately 30% of patients with psoriasis will have a known family history of the disease . In some families, psoriasis appears to behave like a Mendelian autosomal dominant disease, whereas in other cases there is little or no family history . It has been suggested that psoriasis may represent a spectrum of diseases in which different genes, working either alone or in concert (polygenic disease), are important in different families . To date, approximately 35 genetic loci have been associated with psoriasis . Excessive alcohol intake is also associated with disease deterioration and makes management more difficult . Evidence that psoriasis is primarily an immunologic disease comes from many different sources . Experimentally, psoriasis can be induced in non-lesional skin transplanted onto mice by injection of lymphocytes from the same patient . Considerable progress has been made in identifying the precise lymphocytes that cause the disease (see Genetics above) . There has been an explosion of knowledge about immunopathogenetic events in psoriasis . In great part, this has been led by advances in genetics, immunology and therapeutics . These findings are fundamental to our understanding of psoriasis . Psoriasis represents an important and key disease in which translational medicine has led to major clinical advances . Psoriasis is characterized by bright red, elevated, scaly plaques . accumulation of inflammatory cells . Accumulation of inflammatory cells . Indeed, it has been postulated that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease . The increased prevalence of psoriasis among patients with other organ-specific inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is consistent with this hypothesis . As discussed above, genetic studies seem to suggest that both the barrier and the immune system are involved . 
Psychotic symptoms increase caregiver burden, leading to an increase in nursing home placement . In addition, both delusions and hallucinations may give rise to safety concerns for caregivers . With accusations of infidelity, caregivers may feel that their safety is at risk, and delusions may lead to financial and social risks as well . Nursing home placement and mortality . Psychosis has been reported as the single most important precipitant for nursing home placement,, with a consequent increase in mortality . In one study of 11 subjects placed in nursing homes, all died within a 2-year follow-up period . Although other studies have not confirmed this high mortality rate, follow up of 59 subjects 3 years after they had enrolled in the first double-blind trial of clozapine for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) found that 42% of survivors were in nursing homes . During the study, 88% of the subjects had been living at home, with only 12% in nursing homes . In total, 25% of the subjects (15) had died, 6 of whom had died within a few months of completing the trial; none of the deaths was thought to be related to adverse drug effects . The mean duration from baseline (defined as the end of their participation in the 4-month study) to death was 8.3 months . Causes of death included pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction . Eight patients with mini-mental state examination score (MMSE) > 25 at entry were demented at follow up . Although all patients were treated at some point with clozapine, 37 of the 54 survivors continued to have psychotic symptoms beyond the first few months . Forty patients continued to be treated with antipsychotics, 23 on clozapine . Two subjects stopped clozapine because of granulocytopenia . No long-term follow up or short-term mortality was reported in the almost identical trial of clozapine that was performed in France . Healthcare costs . Studies of American healthcare costs have underscored the increased cost associated with PDP . A Medicare review (2000-2010) found that 75% of patients with PDP spent time in long-term care facilities, compared to 56% of patients with PD and no psychosis, and 36% of patients without PD . In addition, the patients with PDP stayed an average of 179 days, compared to 83 days for the non-psychotic patients and 22 days for the controls . The cost difference was $31 178 per year (PDP) versus $14 461 (non-psychotic) . A UK study of 7271 patients with PD (1994-2013) found that those with the disease required $3716 more for healthcare per year than age-matched controls without PD . In addition, patients with PD with greater disability, including psychosis, required an additional $1608 per year . Acute psychosis may require hospitalization, which is both costly and upsetting for the family . Causes for hospitalization include direct safety issues, both for the patient and their family, but also maintenance of a safe level of care, as caregivers are often unable to safely care for psychotic patients who might keep them awake all night or wander outdoors if unsupervised, even for short periods . Drug-associated mortality . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that the deaths of patients receiving pimavanserin were likely to be due to underlying disease rather than drug effects . However, pimavanserin, like all other antipsychotic drugs, carries a black box warning of increased mortality . The warning for pimavanserin was purely derivative, based on data showing increased risk of death with antipsychotics, and did not take drug pharmacology into consideration . The increased mortality associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs must be considered when making treatment plans . However, as no medical disorder has been associated with the increased death rate, it has not been possible to identify a mechanism or even a risk profile to identify those at greatest risk . While the FDA has requested that attempts be made to lower or discontinue antipsychotic use whenever possible, and American nursing homes are graded on their reduction of antipsychotic drug use, this should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time . 
unstable angina (UA) . non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) . ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) . Myocardial infarction (MI) is a manifestation of ACS and is pathologically defined as myocardial cell death due to prolonged ischemia . All types of ACS are usually associated with chest pain or at least chest discomfort . Although some pathological findings are shared by each entity, they differ in clinical severity . These patients have acute chest pain but without persistent ST-segment elevation . Distal embolization can also occur in STEMI . Figures 1.1 and 1.2 provide an overview of the full spectrum of ACS and the characteristic features of each entity . Atherosclerotic plaque formation . These processes result in myocardial hypoperfusion . Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving large and medium-sized arteries . Although it begins early in life, the speed of progression is non-linear, unpredictable and varies markedly between individuals . Dysfunctional endothelium . Atherosclerosis starts with the development of dysfunctional endothelium in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (Table 1.1) . These molecules facilitate the binding and internalization of monocytes into the subendothelial space where they transform into macrophages . Moreover, changes in endothelial permeability and the composition of the subendothelial matrix facilitate the entry and retention of cholesterol-rich low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles . The macrophages avidly engulf the LDL cholesterol and transform into foam cells, leading to the formation of yellow fatty streaks . Plaque vulnerability . A vulnerable plaque is prone to rupture or erosion, leading to platelet-rich thrombosis generation and subsequently to ACS . Plaque vulnerability is influenced by a dynamic balance between collagen synthesis and degradation by MMPs . However, even advanced atherosclerosis can remain clinically silent if arterial stenoses do not limit the blood flow . The downstream arterioles will dilate to compensate for the stenosis . The severity of flow obstruction depends on plaque size, vasoconstriction (spasm) and remodeling of the vessel wall . Symptoms only occur when oxygen demand exceeds the supply . Resting blood flow through a stenosed artery is not significantly affected until the luminal area is reduced by about 80% (or the diameter by at least 50%), although flow reserve is decreased at earlier stages of obstruction . Plaque rupture . The major determinants of thrombus generation are those of the classic 'triad of Virchow' . thrombogenicity of the exposed plaque material (plaque vulnerability) . local flow disturbances (vessel vulnerability) . systemic thrombotic propensity (blood vulnerability) . Erosions around calcium nodules, rapid plaque expansion and intraplaque hemorrhage account for the remaining occurrences of thrombosis and vessel occlusions . Distal microembolization . Thus, distal emboli from either source may cause microvascular obstruction and myocardial ischemia/infarction despite a recanalized infarct-related epicardial coronary artery . Culprit lesions . Therefore, coronary event occurrence requires a 'perfect storm' in which numerous cardiovascular risk factors and classic Virchow's triad converge . These findings suggest that coronary disease is a dynamic and unpredictable process, and prediction of plaque vulnerability and ischemic event occurrence is still a mirage . Thrombus generation . These factors facilitate platelet adhesion and activation . The subsequent intracellular events, particularly downstream from GPVI, lead to the release of the important secondary agonists thromboxane (Tx) A and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) . TxA is produced from membrane phospholipids, and ADP is released from dense granules . Mural platelet-rich 'white' thrombi most often incompletely block coronary blood flow and are present in UA and NSTEMI . In contrast to UA/NSTEMI, STEMI more often results in abrupt and persistent ischemia which, if left untreated, can cause sudden cardiac death . 
Definitions of these terms are provided in Table 1.1 . Biologics are large macromolecules, typically proteins . They range in size and structural complexity from simple proteins such as insulin and growth hormone to complex molecules such as coagulation factors and monoclonal antibodies, as shown in Figure 1.1 . Many biologics, particularly the monoclonal antibodies, are described as targeted therapies because they have been designed to interact with specific receptors on cells . Biologics are created in living systems, such as bacterial, animal or human cell cultures, or are extracted from whole organisms; they cannot be synthesized chemically . Most biologics are complex mixtures; whilst their primary and secondary structures are known, they are less easily characterized at the tertiary level . This stands in contrast to conventional 'small molecule' drugs, which usually have a unique structure that can be fully characterized and are typically produced by inexpensive chemical synthesis that is straightforward to replicate . The complex nature of the biologics, and their manufacturing processes, means that identical copies of these molecule cannot be created . Biosimilar medicines . The primary and secondary amino acid structure, dosing, and route of administration are the same; differences in formulation, presentation, and the administration device are permitted, provided that these differences do not affect safety or effectiveness . As with all biologic medicines, the challenge for manufacturers and regulators is to ensure that copies of biologics are close enough in structure and function to the reference product to have no clinically meaningful differences in practical use . There is inherent variability in the biologics themselves - an important point that is relevant to the discussion of biologics and biosimilars but is often overlooked . This variability has two main sources . Molecules made in living systems have inherent variability, even between batches of the same product, which is known as microheterogeneity . Thus, over time, a reference drug can never be considered to be a generic copy of its version at launch, as illustrated in Figure 1.2 . This inherent variation is known as 'product drift' (see Figure 1.3) . Like the reference (originator) biologic, the biosimilar has a degree of natural variability . When a biosimilar is approved, this variability, and any differences between the biosimilar and the reference biologic, will have been shown not to affect safety or effectiveness . In addition, manufacturing processes change frequently over the life of a biologic, adding to the potential for variability . A 2016 study of all European-approved originator monoclonal antibodies identified a mean of 11 changes with moderate or high potential risk per drug . Process change can result from advances in technology, such as higher yielding host cell systems, improvements in bioreactor design, scaling up of production to meet demand or if production is moved to a new manufacturing site . Changes in manufacturing risks the introduction of more significant variation in the tertiary structure of a biologic, known as 'step changes' (see Figure 1.3) . Comparability of the drug before and after a step change needs to be demonstrated to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed . This comparability is usually assessed using only analytic tests although, rarely, new regulatory trials have been required . One example, a step change resulting from a new process in the manufacture of darbepoetin-alfa required confirmation through additional phase I, II and III studies . For this reason, manufacturing changes are monitored closely under the 2014 International Council for Harmonisation Q5E . Bioidenticals and 'intended copy' biologics . These terms are mentioned here because they occur in the context of biologics and biosimilars and are potentially confusing . Bioidenticals are products that are the same but have different brand names (as can also occur with small molecule drugs); some examples of bioidenticals are provided in Table 1.2 . These can arise when a product is co-developed but marketed by different manufacturers in different countries under different brand names . 'Intended copy' biologics have arisen in markets with less stringent regulatory pathways, as a way to deliver affordable medicines . Such medicines, while clinically active, may not be close enough to the originator molecule to be judged biosimilar in analytical or clinical testing . Examples of clinical problems that have arisen following use of such products are described on page 36 . 
Maria-Virginia Bluthgen MD, Department of Cancer Medicine, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France . Chemotherapy is still the mainstay of systemic treatment for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . The main factors influencing chemotherapy regimen selection are histology of the tumor, comorbidities and performance status (PS) . Since 2004, patients with tumors harboring sensitizing mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, may receive an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as an alternative to chemotherapy (see Chapter 8) . This chapter describes treatment for patients without such actionable mutations . First-line chemotherapy . Cisplatin- and carboplatin-based regimens yield similar improvements in survival but with different toxicity profiles; cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with more severe nephrotoxicity, nausea and vomiting . However, some trials suggest that cisplatin may achieve higher response rates and survival outcomes . Comorbidities, clinical presentation (determining need of response) and toxicity profile, are all factors that may influence the selection of the preferred platinum compound for an individual patient . Two-drug combinations comprised of a platinum and a cytotoxic agent, such as gemcitabine, vinorelbine, docetaxel or paclitaxel, have all resulted in similar survival . However, toxicity profiles may differ . Differences in survival outcomes have been reported depending on the histology of NSCLC . For example, the benefit of pemetrexed appears to be restricted to non-squamous tumors . Median OS was prolonged by a modest amount with the combination of the target therapy and cisplatin-gemcitabine in the squamous cell population . No other target agents have demonstrated clinically meaningful survival improvement in first-line treatment . Chemotherapy in the elderly . Duration of chemotherapy . Historically, continuation of cytotoxic chemotherapy combinations with the same two drugs for more than 4 cycles has shown no survival advantage but has increased related toxicities . Maintenance therapy . The two strategies for maintenance therapy following disease control after first-line treatment are continuous and switch maintenance . A benefit in PFS only was seen with the same strategy in combination with gemcitabine . Switch maintenance with pemetrexed after non-progression following a non-pemetrexed combination regimen, has also shown a benefit in terms of PFS and OS in one randomized trial . Collectively, these data suggest that survival could be improved with maintenance pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous histology . Second-line chemotherapy . Almost all patients will eventually progress after first-line treatment and will require further treatment . Factors to take into account when choosing further therapy include PS, previous treatment, histology and whether a driver mutation is present . In 2004, second-line pemetrexed showed equivalent efficacy with fewer side effects to docetaxel . Re-challenge with platinum-based regimens is a widely used strategy in ovarian and small-cell lung cancer with major benefit reported in patients relapsing after 6 months or more . To date, no prospective phase III studies directly addressing this approach have been conducted in patients with NSCLC, but this strategy is reasonable in clinical practice . Second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy combined with a targeted agent has also shown promising results . The results showed prolonged OS (10.5 vs 9.1 months; HR=0.86, p =0.023) and PFS (4.5 vs 3.0 months; HR=0.76, p <0.0001) in the ramucirumab group . The addition of nintedanib, an oral inhibitor of VEGFR1-3 / FGFR1-3 / PDGFR / RET / FLT3 / Src, to conventional docetaxel therapy has been tested in 1314 patients . Results demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS (3.5 vs 2.7 months; HR=0.85, p =0.007) in all predefined subgroups . OS was significantly longer among patients with adenocarcinoma histology (12.6 vs 10.3 months; HR=0.83, p =0.0359) and the drug has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for this indication . 
The Bonferroni correction divides the 0.05 equally across all endpoints . For m tests, adjusted significant level = alpha/m . Making this correction will affect the power of the study (see Chapter 3 for a discussion on power) . Non-equal division of the alpha . In certain situations, it may not make sense to divide the alpha equally . For example, in a study of patients with advanced prostate cancer, researchers may want the flexibility to draw confirmatory conclusions for both PFS and OS as co-primary endpoints . Of course, researchers must decide how to divide the alpha at the trial design stage; it is not appropriate to decide on the alpha split once the data are available! . The Hochberg approach . The Bonferroni correction is not the only approach to splitting the alpha; the Hochberg method is also in fairly common use . Suppose the p -values for three different endpoints have been calculated and ordered from largest to smallest . If, however, the largest p -value is > 0.05, statistical significance cannot be declared for that endpoint . Instead, look to the endpoint with the second largest p -value . Hochberg versus Bonferroni . In this sense, Hochberg always performs better than Bonferroni; it is more sensitive in terms of being able to pick up significant differences . Hierarchical testing . Hierarchical testing, or closed testing as it is sometimes called, places an alternative constraint on the testing to control the FWER at 5% . Regulatory authorities would not allow these nominally significant p -values to be reported in the label . Estimated hazard ratios could be reported, but to avoid any misinterpretation of the statistics the p -values and confidence intervals would not be included . The hierarchical order . Clearly, it is important to get the hierarchical order correct, both in terms of clinical relevance and other practicalities . In general, it is more difficult to achieve statistical significance for OS than PFS, largely because there will be fewer OS events than PFS events at the time of the analysis . Hierarchical testing is a good way to think about primary and secondary endpoints when designing the study . Secondary endpoints are simply primary endpoints that are less important than the designated primary endpoint . Combining approaches . It is also possible to mix and match the various approaches . Subgroup evaluation . It is not uncommon for a study to show an impressive treatment difference in a key subgroup but fail in terms of the primary endpoint . In this situation, it is generally not possible to refocus attention on the subgroup to make a confirmatory claim because of the problem of multiplicity . Treatment differences within subgroups will occur by chance and, especially when there are a lot of subgroups, they are almost inevitable . Remember that 1 in 40 p -values will be statistically significant in favor of the experimental treatment by chance . An 'interesting' result in a subgroup would therefore only constitute an exploratory finding . Forest plots . The main reason for looking at subgroups in this way is to assess the consistency of an observed treatment effect . The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has provided a draft guideline on subgroup evaluation in which it explains how to interpret forest plots . If a point estimate strays outside of the overall CI . homogeneity of treatment effect is still supported if the CI for that subgroup substantially overlaps the overall CI . concerns regarding heterogeneity should be raised when the point estimate moves further away from the overall CI, particularly when the subgroup CI is separate from the overall CI . To make these judgments, it is useful to mark a band from the overall CI down through the plot (see Figure 4.1) . In Figure 4.1, the hazard ratio for the subgroup with no metastases is higher than 1 and the CI is starting to separate from the overall confidence interval . However, this is the smallest subgroup and it may also be that there are relatively few deaths in that subgroup, making a firm conclusion regarding heterogeneity problematic . Finally, it is not appropriate to discount subgroups in terms of a treatment benefit when the CI crosses the 'no effect' line . This does not mean that the treatment does not work in that subgroup . This is often a fundamental misunderstanding and a mistake that you should not make . 
Treating and preventing relapses . Corticosteroids are the mainstay of acute treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses . There are conflicts in the data regarding effectiveness of steroids, with some studies suggesting steroids improve overall outcome after relapse and others showing transient worsening after steroids . However, evidence supporting the use of oral prednisolone/prednisone is limited and there is no indication for prolonged oral steroid therapy following MS relapse . For this reason, high-dose oral or intravenous methylprednisolone is the preferred treatment choice for acute relapse . There are times when patients cannot tolerate intravenous or oral steroids, or second therapy is necessary for more severe relapses . PLEX improves functioning after relapse; a recent study showed that second-line PLEX treatment for severe optic neuritis improves visual functioning by more than 50% . It can be considered if a patient has suboptimal response to steroids . Intravenous Ig has demonstrated inconsistent results in MS, mainly because of the small study sizes used . Studies of vitamin D supplementation in individuals predisposed to MS (exempli gratia those with a family history of MS) are also forthcoming . Managing symptoms . Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration culminate in a variety of persistent symptoms that are not necessarily related to acute relapse . The most common are . reduction in mobility . Changes in 'homeostatic' (normal physiological) function can exacerbate existing MS symptoms . Oral treatment . Botulinum toxin type A is a useful therapy for patients with severe focal spasticity . More radical treatments may be required for intractable spasticity, particularly affecting the lower limbs . Potential adverse effects include . Fatigue is a common symptom during relapse, but may follow a course independent of clinical and imaging markers of disease activity . Clearly defining and quantifying MS-related fatigue (exempli gratia with the MS Fatigue Severity Score) will help standardize the results of future clinical trials . Bladder and bowel problems may occur in the context of an MS relapse, and thus management of the relapse can sometimes alleviate associated sphincter dysfunction in the short term . However, bowel and particularly bladder symptoms (frequency, urgency, urge incontinence) can become established and chronic in MS . Investigation of bladder dysfunction in MS includes . All patients should be advised to maintain adequate fluid intake . Pain is a common accompaniment of MS . It can be divided into acute and chronic pain . Acute pain . Paroxysmal pain syndromes . Trigeminal neuralgia is a common acute presentation in MS and may be clinically indistinguishable from the idiopathic counterpart . Acute burning/dysesthetic (spinothalamic) pain occasionally accompanies MS relapse . This pain may have a radicular distribution, but is commonly more diffuse and usually involves the lower limbs . Inflammatory pain . The acute inflammation associated with demyelination may give rise to pain . For example, acute retrobulbar optic neuritis can be very uncomfortable, particularly with ocular movement, and responds promptly to steroids administered for the acute relapse . Migrainous pain . For reasons that are unclear, migraine is more common in patients with MS than in the general population . Chronic pain . Some of the pain syndromes listed above can become chronic, and a similar approach is used in terms of pharmacological interventions depending on the type of pain (see Fast Facts: Chronic and Cancer Pain) . Cannabinoids are an adjunct to traditional pain modulators in these circumstances . Multidisciplinary management with pain specialists who use non-pharmacological techniques can be very helpful . It may be difficult to predict the degree of recovery from acute spinal relapses that impair mobility . Mobility assistance will help to . reduce fatigue . Physical therapy/rehabilitation can improve muscle weakness, spasticity and general wellbeing, particularly in the context of deconditioning associated with relapses or intercurrent illness . A multidisciplinary approach is especially important in addressing mobility, spasticity, pain control and incontinence . Pharmacological treatment . The first drug to improve walking in MS was approved in the USA in 2010 . Mood disorders, particularly depression, are extremely common in MS . 
Pharmacological treatments . Despite considerable effort and investment, however, only one agent - orlistat - remains widely marketed and is of limited efficacy . Rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor antagonist, was withdrawn from the market following unacceptable problems associated with depression and aggression . Mechanisms of action . leptin, with its global effects . endocannabinoid system . opioid (naltrexone) system . drugs that affect digestion and subsequent absorption of macronutrients (orlistat) . drugs that modify peripheral metabolism by affecting lipolysis, lipogenesis or muscle energy utilization . Currently marketed drugs . Orlistat is a peripherally acting gastric and intestinal lipase inhibitor that reduces fat digestion and absorption . The usual dose of orlistat is 120 mg three times daily and it must be taken with meals . Rarer, more severe side effects include seizures and changes in blood sugar levels . Urologic side effects include frequency and urgency and erectile dysfunction . The drug should not be taken in combination with SSRIs . The most frequent adverse events reported were headache, dizziness and nausea . Managing expectations . The aim should be to improve well-being and reduce cardiometabolic risk . Effect on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors . Type 2 diabetes . Patients with higher baseline plasma glucose levels have a greater improvement in glycemic control . Both sibutramine and orlistat produce greater reductions in HbA 1c than placebo . Blood pressure . Effects on blood pressure are important considerations in relation to pharmacotherapy . Future products . A combination of bupropion and the antiepileptic zonisamide is in development . Types of bariatric surgery . These narrow definitions are now recognized to be too simplistic . Food eaten in excess of this amount can result in discomfort or bloating and may be regurgitated or vomited . Examples include gastric stapling and laparoscopic gastric banding . After passing through the restricted portion of the stomach, food passes through the rest of the bowel normally . It is a technically challenging procedure requiring specialist training and experience . Two theories predominate . This leads to increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion and glucagon reduction by pancreatic beta and alpha cells, respectively . In fact, the band works more as a delaying tactic rather than a restrictive one . Gastroplasty involves partitioning a 15-40 mL pouch at the top of the stomach . Biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal switch . The operation is rare, and rigorous patient selection is required . The side-effect profile is similar to BPD, and it is unusual for the operation to be offered . Other surgical procedures . Artificial bezoar . This is a balloon that is inflated in the stomach, restricting the residual volume of the organ and hence food intake . Skin contouring . Men may undergo correction of pseudogynecomastia . Jaw wiring is an out-of-date procedure . Success rates . Thus, a person weighing 135 kg (300 lb) might realistically expect to lose about 44 kg (100 lb) . The general complication rate for primary surgery was 2.6%, far lower than anticipated . If 25% underwent surgery, the figure would be £1.295 billion . Bands are no better than conventional lifestyle interventions for OSA . These criteria are widely recognized and accepted . Children and adolescents . The AHA also points out that short-term mortality appears to be low but significant complications can occur . Presurgical assessment . This is described in more detail in Psychological implications . Postoperative problems often result from pre-existing depressive disorders not resolving as anticipated; such problems should be addressed beforehand . Surgical risk . Long-term adverse effects depend on the nature of the procedure used . Frank malnutrition and intractable hypoglycemia are rare side effects . Psychological implications . Bariatric surgery can have huge psychological implications for the individual . Some individuals see it as a chance to deflect the blame onto someone else if they still fail to lose weight . Supportive role for primary care . 
Conduction is the speed at which cells propagate electrical wavefronts . Cardiac cells have a unique ability to depolarize rhythmically . Atrial depolarization . The SA node acts as the heart's pacemaker . Atrioventricular node depolarization . Septal depolarization . Ventricular depolarization and systole . The isoelectric ST segment and T wave correspond with electrical recovery of the ventricles . Ventricular repolarization and diastole . Atrial flutter . The atrial rate is usually 300 bpm . Atrial fibrillation . Several types of AF are clinically recognized . paroxysmal - usually recurrent but lasting fewer than 7 days and self-terminating . persistent - lasting longer than 7 days and requiring intervention for termination . long-standing persistent - continuous AF that lasts for 1 year or more . permanent - decision is made by the cardiologist not to attempt termination . This form of paroxysmal AF is occasionally referred to as 'focal AF' . Ventricular tachycardia . Ventricular ectopics are often the trigger . Ventricular fibrillation . Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is now thought to have a re-entrant basis . Ablation of these ectopics has been shown to prevent recurrent fibrillation . It is thought that these ectopics allow localized re-entry . Electrical properties of the atrioventricular node . The conduction properties of the AV node are unique . Decremental conduction of the AV node is age related . This type of AV block does not usually require treatment . Some antiarrhythmic drugs also slow AV nodal conduction and may cause Wenckebach phenomenon . Influence of the autonomic nervous system . Other factors such as thyroid hormones and pregnancy also affect heart rate . Carotid sinus massage . Classification of arrhythmias . The most common arrhythmias are discussed in greater detail in subsequent chapters . disorders of impulse formation - abnormal automaticity or triggered activity . disorders of impulse conduction - re-entry . Disorders of impulse formation are uncommon . Disorders in this category are characterized by an inappropriate discharge rate from the SA node or an ectopic pacemaker . There are two types: abnormal automaticity and triggered activity . Abnormal automaticity . Automaticity is the property of a myocyte to initiate an impulse spontaneously without prior stimulation . Slow atrial, junctional and ventricular escape rhythms are automatic in nature . Atrial tachycardias linked to digitalis overdose are also thought to be of this type . Accessory pathways . Narrow versus wide (broad) QRS complexes . Narrow-complex tachycardia . Wide-complex tachycardias (WCTs) have three possible causes . a problem with the specialized conducting tissue . bypassing of the specialized conducting tissue . impulses that arise in the ventricles outside the specialized conducting tissue . Although WCTs can occur during SVT, they are uncommon . Inappropriate drug management of a WCT can be dangerous or even fatal . Sinus node re-entry tachycardia . The surface ECG looks like an inappropriate and persistent sinus tachycardia . Other causes, such as thyrotoxicosis and pregnancy, need to be excluded . Supraventricular tachycardia . Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome . The best-described re-entrant circuit occurs in WPW syndrome . The characteristics of these pathways are highlighted in Table 1.2 . The delta wave vector can be used to determine the position of the accessory pathways . Antegrade and retrograde conduction . This tachycardia is often misdiagnosed as ventricular in origin . Concealed accessory pathways . The resting ECG is therefore normal . The AV nodal area is complex . Atrial tachycardia . The atrial rate is often 150-250 bpm . 
Over the past decade, clinical outcomes for patients with STEMI have improved as a result of increased awareness, speed of diagnosis, and treatment with both reperfusion and adjuvant medical therapy . Despite these developments, thousands of STEMI patients fail to receive critical therapy in a timely fashion each year, and nearly 30% do not receive any reperfusion treatment . Clinical presentation . MIs can be clinically silent and unrecognized by the patient . These patients are more likely to be older, women, diabetic and/or have previous heart failure . In 25-30% of patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), initial angiography shows a patent infarct-related artery . In the emergency department, the management of patients with suspected STEMI includes pain control, rapid identification of patients eligible for urgent reperfusion therapy, triaging lower-risk patients to the appropriate setting in the hospital and avoiding inappropriate discharge of patients with STEMI . In patients with hypoxemia, oxygen should be administered by nasal prongs or face mask . mechanical (PCI) . Patients without ST-segment elevation are not candidates for immediate pharmacological reperfusion but should receive anti-ischemic therapy and catheter-based therapy . Early mortality risk assessment can be based on the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) risk score for STEMI . Percutaneous coronary interventions (see Chapter 3) during the early hours of STEMI can be divided into . primary PCI (first-line) . facilitated PCI - PCI combined with pharmacological reperfusion therapy . Indications for primary PCI are shown in Table 5.1 . In patients presenting early, with a large amount of myocardium at risk, the delay should be less than 60 minutes from FMC . Patients with contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy have a higher morbidity and mortality than those eligible for this therapy . Primary PCI is the preferred treatment for patients in shock . An immediate transfer of patients to a PCI-capable center after initiation of fibrinolytic therapy usually helps to shorten the time until rescue PCI . STEMI networks . In Europe, 20-95% of patients with STEMI undergo primary PCI, and numbers are increasing, a range that reflects local resources and capabilities . Fibrinolytic therapy . The available data support prehospital initiation of fibrinolytic treatment if reperfusion is indicated . Early fibrinolytic therapy is associated with similar outcomes to primary PCI, if early angiography and PCI were performed in those patients who needed intervention . Indications for fibrinolytic therapy are shown in Table 5.2 . Contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy are shown in Table 5.4 . Assessment of reperfusion is crucial to establish the successfulness of therapy . In patients intolerant to ASA, clopidogrel is indicated as an alternative . In STEMI patients referred for primary PCI, international guidelines recommend that prasugrel should be administered as soon as possible . At the same time, unanticipated antiplatelet therapy cessation may put patients at an increased risk for adverse events . This trial further confirmed the preferred use of bivalirudin as an anticoagulant in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI . In the ATOLL trial, enoxaparin, 0.5 mg intravenous bolus, was compared with UH in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI . Fondaparinux is not recommended at all in primary PCI for acute STEMI patients because of concerns for catheter-related thrombus and interventional complications . Nitroglycerin is administered in STEMI patients to relieve ischemic pain and also as a vasodilator in patients with LV failure . Intravenous beta-blockers are used in patients with STEMI regardless of the planned reperfusion strategy, but must be avoided in patients with hypotension or heart failure . Oral treatment should be considered during hospital stay and continued thereafter in all STEMI patients without contraindications, and is indicated in patients with heart failure or LV dysfunction . High-dose statins should be initiated or continued early after admission in all STEMI patients without contraindication or history of intolerance, regardless of initial cholesterol values . Exercise-based rehabilitation is recommended . 
Although the incidence of ALS is not thought to be increasing, greater life expectancy and improved ascertainment mean that more cases are being recorded . In common with other neurodegenerative disorders, age is the leading risk factor for the development of ALS . True population-based data are scarce, but the mean age of onset in Western hemisphere studies is approximately 65 years for men and 67 years for women . The mean age of first symptom onset is younger in data from specialist clinics, reflecting the bias in attendees . An individual's risk of developing ALS increases with age, but the overall lifetime risk is estimated to be 1 in 400 . Emerging data from China, the Indian subcontinent and Africa indicate a significantly younger age of first symptom onset in these populations . ALS case reports from the early 20th century in the European literature also had a consistently lower mean age, which has been attributed to reduced life expectancy at that time . Socioeconomic development, in particular dietary changes, may be an important contributor to the delay in symptom onset . 'What is the cause of ALS?' This question has no single answer . Aging and a gradual loss of cellular tolerance is at the core of neurodegeneration . A common set of clinical endpoints is associated with an increasing array of upstream genetic and cellular mechanisms . Genetic factors . Most cases of ALS appear to arise sporadically; only 5-10% of individuals are known to have familial ALS, which usually affects a first-degree relative . Nevertheless, approximately 15% of all cases of ALS are associated with a variety of autosomal and largely dominant single nucleotide gene mutations or a repeat expansion (Figure 2.1) . The genetic landscape of ALS has continued to expand since a linkage study in 1993 identified mutations in the SOD1 gene . SOD1 mutations account for 20% of familial cases but fewer than 2% of all ALS cases . In keeping with the 'multi-hit' hypothesis mentioned above, symptom onset tends to occur at an earlier age in genetically driven ALS . The syndrome shares some of the clinical features of ALS, but also other neurodegenerative disorders . Familial clustering has supported some genetically driven vulnerability . A reduction in cases in recent years has coincided with a decline in bat consumption . Occupational risk factors . Data in relation to exposure to electromagnetic fields, residentially or occupationally, as a risk factor for ALS are unclear . Premorbid athleticism among those who develop ALS has been postulated for many decades . Several studies have shown increased leisure time and occupational physical activity to be risk factors . Many people with established ALS experience accelerated weight loss in the months before the onset of symptoms and throughout the disease course . Smoking is a relatively weak risk factor for ALS . SOD1 -mediated ALS shares much of the core clinical phenotype of sporadic ALS and SOD1 was the first gene to be linked to familial ALS . However, TDP-43 aggregation (see page 21) is common to 97% of ALS cases, familial or not, yet SOD1 ALS is not a 'TDP-43-opathy' . RNA biology . The discovery of the predominantly RNA-binding protein TDP-43 as the cellular signature of nearly all cases of ALS was supported by the identification of mutations in the TARDBP gene, albeit in very rare cases of familial ALS . It is therefore unsurprising that viable mutations of the parent gene represent fewer than 0.5% of all cases of ALS . However, further support for the concept of deranged RNA processing underlying ALS was provided by the discovery of another rare cause of familial ALS, namely mutations in another RNA-binding gene, FUS . It was the identification, in 2011, of an intronic GGGGCC HRE in C9orf72 as the cause of at least one-third of all familial ALS cases (and 10% of all ALS cases) that brought particular emphasis to the study of RNA biology (see page 26) . Short-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have demonstrated consistently increased excitability of the cortex in ALS, and at least some months before the onset of symptoms in carriers of highly penetrant ALS-causing genetic mutations . Modeling ALS . The inability to safely biopsy the human nervous system is one reason why the ALS disease process has to be investigated using animal and cellular models . The discovery, in 1993, of mutations in the SOD1 gene in cases of familial ALS was rapidly followed by the creation of a transgenic mouse model . 
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world . In the USA, approximately 2 million people suffer from an alcohol-induced liver disorder . In the UK in 2012, ALD accounted for 63% (4425) of all alcohol-related deaths, an 18% increase on 2002 . Medical costs associated with caring for these patients are enormous . Intervention for patients presenting with the early stages of liver injury helps to prevent further permanent liver injury . Interrupting alcoholism is the key, but this is not an easy task and frustrates many primary care providers, families and patients . Patients may present anywhere along the spectrum of ALD . Those with isolated steatosis usually have few symptoms or signs of liver disease and are typically identified only by abnormal liver tests . Patients with alcoholic hepatitis are usually jaundiced and report fatigue, malaise and anorexia . The liver is enlarged and tender, and ascites and edema are often present . In late-stage disease, the liver may be small and hard and there may be cutaneous stigmata of chronic liver disease, such as palmar erythema, spider nevi or telangiectasia (Figure 3.1) . Liver function tests . Examination of laboratory results is helpful in diagnosing ALD . The aminotransferases are elevated and have a characteristic pattern in patients with ALD: the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is almost always higher than the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and the greater the ratio the more likely that the liver disease is due to alcohol . The last two are good markers of the severity of ALD . A liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing ALD and in documenting the severity of liver injury, but may not be required in all cases . This is particularly true when the patient's history is suggestive of ALD, there is no evidence of viral hepatitis and biopsy could be difficult (id est patients with coagulopathy or severe ascites) . Concomitant disease . It is important to rule out other forms of liver disease and to document any concomitant injurious agents . Chronic hepatitis C and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis B are common in patients with alcoholism . Although most patients who drink alcohol never develop significant liver disease, and many patients with viral hepatitis do well over long periods of time, the combination of viral hepatitis and alcoholism often accelerates the development of advanced liver injury . Thus, identification of a patient with both diseases is important . There is an interesting parallel between ALD and the more recently recognized non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; see Chapter 6), which is usually seen in patients with insulin resistance, obesity or diabetes . Once fat appears in the liver, a similar progression of events occurs in some patients, resulting in irreversible scarring in the liver . Accurate determination of alcohol consumption can be difficult, however, as patients often under-report how much alcohol they consume, and denial is common . The CAGE questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and reports from families may be helpful in identifying patients whose alcohol consumption is excessive (see Table 1.2) . Small amounts of alcohol would not be expected to cause ALD in men and, if it can be confirmed that a patient consumes only a small amount of alcohol, other causes of liver disease must be considered . Achieving abstinence typically requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, professional alcoholism counselors and, often, mental health professionals . This requires a substantial commitment on the part of the patient and the patient's family . Alcoholics are usually malnourished, and improving nutrition is associated with improved outcomes . This is particularly important for patients with alcoholic hepatitis . Most alcoholics need protein . Unfortunately, however, a few patients with advanced liver disease develop hepatic encephalopathy when given large amounts of protein . Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammatory condition . Thus, corticosteroids are a logical treatment for ALD . Efforts to decrease TNF levels have shown some promise in the treatment of patients with alcoholic hepatitis . Liver transplantation for patients with ALD remains a controversial topic . Unfortunately, some patients do return to drinking following transplant, although long-term success is common . 
First episodes of psychosis can go undetected and untreated for long periods of time . The median duration of positive psychotic symptoms before detection is 12-24 weeks, but in many cases symptoms endure for much longer before detection, particularly if negative symptoms are taken into account . The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is strongly associated with response to treatment and speed to remission in the first episode, although it is still disputed whether this is truly a causal link . Nonetheless, this observation is the main impetus behind the increased focus on early detection and treatment of the first episode of schizophrenia . Early detection . First, is it possible to detect, and so treat, people earlier in their first episode? Second, if so, will earlier treatment lead to better outcomes? . Some of the reasons for delayed detection are given in Table 12.1 . Public education, training of family physicians and youth workers in recognizing early signs, and specialist rapid assessment teams have been shown in pilot early-intervention services to reduce median DUP to 6 weeks, with a concomitant reduction in symptom severity by the time treatment is initiated . Randomized controlled trials of whole services suggest that early detection and intervention improve medium-term outcomes . Only part of the link between long DUP and poor outcome is explained by the fact that a long DUP leads to more severe symptoms by the time treatment is commenced (Table 12.2) . Optimal treatment in the first episode . Key elements of an early intervention strategy are given in Table 12.3 . Short-term outcome from the first episode is good in 85% of cases, with remission usually achieved within 3 months . Patients in the first episode are responsive to relatively low doses of antipsychotic drugs, and treatment should be started with the equivalent of haloperidol, 2 mg daily, or less . Similarly, first-episode patients are sensitive to the neurological and metabolic adverse effects of drugs . Added cognitive behavioral therapy speeds remission and helps maintain recovery . Although remission from the first episode is usual, 50% of people relapse within the following 2 years and 80% within the following 5 years . Prodromal states: can schizophrenia be prevented? . It is possible to identify individuals in the community who are at very high risk of developing schizophrenia in the near future . Table 12.4a summarizes the descriptions of such cases with so-called prodromal or clinical-high-risk symptoms . In DSM-5, these symptoms are listed as a 'condition for further study' (Table 12.4b) . Overall, follow-up studies of individuals seeking help for these symptoms show that a significant proportion develop schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder over the following 12 months . Early follow-up studies of clinical-high-risk cases suggested rates of transition of 40%, although more recent studies suggest that 10-15% is more representative . If effective drug or psychological interventions are given at this prodromal stage, it may be feasible to prevent, delay or at least ameliorate subsequent psychosis in such cases (Case history 12.1) . Randomized trials have shown that second-generation antipsychotic drug treatments reduce rates of transition to schizophrenia and that cognitive therapy may also do so . While this is one of the most promising current research areas, the ethical issues relating to the treatment of individuals, most of whom will not go on to develop psychosis, still need to be fully explored . 
As a consequence, supportive care has become increasingly important for patients with leukemia . Blood transfusions are among the most important forms of supportive care for patients with leukemia . Prophylaxis and treatment of infections . Patients with leukemia are at high risk of infection, partly because of the disease itself and partly because of the immune dysfunction induced by chemotherapy . Effective prevention and treatment of infections is therefore central to disease management . Typically, prophylactic therapy in acute leukemia includes . Prophylactic use of quinolone antibiotics has been shown to reduce infection and mortality rates after chemotherapy . Food safety is important during and after cancer treatment because immunologic impairment renders the patient more susceptible to food-borne illnesses . However, studies have not shown any significant differences in infection rates in patients given neutropenic diets . Treatment of infection . Such sources may include . It should be noted that signs and symptoms of infection may not be obvious in patients receiving steroids . Growth factor treatment . Such treatment may be considered in patients with leukemia at high risk of complications from infection . In practice, use of growth factors varies between centers, depending on the disease, the timing in relation to treatment and patient factors . In patients with ALL, a number of randomized clinical studies have been undertaken to determine the optimal duration of G-CSF treatment during induction chemotherapy . The benefits include . As in patients with ALL, overall survival rates did not differ between treated patients and controls . Managing fatigue . CRF is almost universal in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy . Patients usually recover after treatment, although some cancer survivors report that it can remain troublesome even after treatment . As such, it is important not to overlook the effect of CRF on patients' wellbeing . This should include information about known patterns of fatigue during and following treatment, and reassurance that treatment-related fatigue is not necessarily an indicator of disease progression . Patients with moderate or severe fatigue require more focused evaluation . Identifiable conditions known to cause fatigue, including anemia, pain and depression, should be treated according to practice guidelines . Non-specific causes of fatigue may require both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, including . Treatment of nausea and vomiting . Importantly, CINV can lead to patients refusing further courses of chemotherapy . Treatment of hyperuricemia . During induction therapy, treatment with allopurinol is recommended until hyperuricemia resolves . Central venous catheters facilitate the management of patients with leukemia, and they are commonly used to deliver intensive induction chemotherapy to patients with AML . Managing pain . Patients with leukemia may experience pain caused by the disease itself, complications of the disease, invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment effects or unrelated medical conditions (Table 6.5) . The management of pain in this setting requires a multidisciplinary approach, which should include the management of psychosocial factors that may augment pain, such as anxiety and depression, sleeplessness and financial problems . Prevention of pain . It can be so severe as to delay further treatment . Treatment of pain . Treatment of the leukemia itself is a primary option for reducing pain . Conversely, these treatments can be the cause of further pain . Pain treatments include . patient education about pain . The intensity of treatment can be increased according to the individual patient's needs, taking into account patient-specific variables such as performance status, comorbidities and concurrent medications . Treatment of splenomegaly . There are three approaches to management in patients with chronic leukemia . Fertility considerations before chemotherapy . Certain leukemia treatments, such as some chemotherapy regimens or HSCT, can impair fertility, and this may be an important concern for younger patients wishing to start a family . Before treatment, fertility issues should be raised with all patients with reproductive potential . These include . prevention of new and recurrent cancers and other late effects . intervention for consequences of cancer and treatment exempli gratia anxiety, depression and psychological distress . survival care planning . End of life care in advanced disease . Retrospective studies in patients with leukemia and other hematologic malignancies have shown that in the last month of life patients experience bleeding, infections, pain, shortness of breath, CNS disturbances and fatigue . specialists in palliative care . 
AKI is seen in up to 5% of hospital patients, and is far more common in the elderly . Pregnant women should be investigated as usual; kidney biopsy, if indicated, is safe . In general, prerenal AKI will recover rapidly once kidney perfusion is re-established . In ATN, the degree of tubular damage is such that kidney recovery is often delayed for 2 weeks or longer . Important questions . The history and examination will provide clues, but renal ultrasonography will provide the most important information . This should be revealed by renal ultrasonography . Is acute vascular occlusion present? Possible occlusion should be assessed by Doppler ultrasonography of the renal artery and veins . If it is strongly suspected, more accurate imaging (for example, using magnetic resonance angiography) should be performed . Intrinsic renal disease . Tubular damage is often caused by exogenous toxins, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), heavy metals and contrast agents . It is essential to look for hematuria, urinary casts and proteinuria, which suggest a diagnosis of glomerulonephritis or tubulointerstitial nephritis . In these circumstances, kidney biopsy may be indicated . Postrenal acute kidney injury . In most cases (but not all), lower tract obstruction will lead to dilatation of the renal pelvis, which is visible on ultrasonography . Prolonged obstruction may lead to irreversible kidney damage . Less commonly, intrarenal obstruction occurs as a result of deposition of crystals in the tubules (exempli gratia oxalate in ethylene glycol poisoning) . Accurate measurement of urine output is essential to prevent volume overload or depletion . The situation may change rapidly and requires frequent clinical assessment together with CVP monitoring and measurement of body weight . There is no evidence in favor of using low-dose dopamine infusions; indeed, there is good evidence of a lack of benefit . Potassium and sodium levels . Potassium restriction is nearly always necessary and is typically limited to less than 50 mmol/day . In the acute situation, hyperkalemia may be managed with dextrose/insulin infusions and administration of calcium gluconate . In the slightly longer term, potassium-binding resins can be used if dialysis is not immediately available . Sodium intake should be restricted to about 80 mmol/day, depending on losses . Serum potassium and sodium concentrations should be assessed daily . Acidosis may be limited by protein restriction, though a daily intake of at least approximately 1 g of high-quality protein per kilogram of body weight is necessary to maintain adequate nutrition . Sodium bicarbonate may be used to treat acidosis, but has the potential disadvantage that it may worsen sodium overload . Drug modification . As many of the drugs prescribed for patients with AKI are excreted via the kidney, doses must be adjusted and drug levels monitored accordingly . Nephrotoxic drugs, such as NSAIDs and aminoglycosides, should be avoided . Infection control . It is important to maintain adequate nutrition, preferably via the enteral route, but using parenteral nutrition if necessary . Dialysis is indicated to treat the clinical consequences of uremia and to control electrolyte, acid-base and fluid balance . Peritoneal dialysis is usually only performed when hemodialysis is unavailable . Specific treatments . Acute renal artery thrombosis (of a single functioning kidney) may be treated surgically, or by angioplasty and stenting . Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis may respond to a short course of high-dose corticosteroids, though no controlled trials have been undertaken to support this approach . Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may respond to plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma . Most patients with ATN should recover kidney function, provided that they survive the underlying illness . However, increasingly it is being recognized that AKI is a risk factor for the subsequent development of CKD . Similarly, most patients will recover from acute interstitial nephritis . Death is likely if AKI is associated with failure of more than three other organ systems . In patients acquiring AKI in the community, however, mortality is much lower (10-30%) . 
It is essential that oncologists and oncology practitioners take significant time and effort to prepare patients adequately for their first course of chemotherapy . Outcomes are improved by following the recommendations of national or international guidelines for CINV . All of the guidance for managing CINV in this book adheres to these international guidelines . Management principles . The route of delivery will depend on what the patient is best able to tolerate . In general, antiemetics given either orally or intravenously in appropriate doses have equivalent efficacy . Highly emetogenic chemotherapy . The recommended doses for these agents are shown in Table 4.3 . Women with breast cancer receiving AC chemotherapy have a particularly high risk of CINV and are included in these recommendations . Choice of antiemetic agent . Many clinical institutions have pharmacy committees that provide recommendations or formularies for specific antiemetic regimens . These recommendations should be based on cost, efficacy and toxicity . Choice of 5-HT RA . In the first trial, intravenous palonosetron, 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg, was compared with intravenous ondansetron, 32 mg . In the second trial, palonosetron, 0.75 mg, was compared with granisetron, 40 μg/kg . In addition, a meta-analysis of 16 randomized clinical trials compared palonosetron to the first-generation 5-HT RAs . As discussed on page 34, this meta-analysis revealed that palonosetron is statistically superior in the acute, delayed and overall phases . Ondansetron, granisetron and (oral) dolasetron are available as generics; palonosetron is not available as a generic and has a higher acquisition cost . Tropisetron is distributed in various countries worldwide, but is not available in the USA . International guidelines recommend the use of palonosetron as the preferred agent because of its higher efficacy compared with ondansetron or granisetron (see above) . Choice of NK-1 RA . Aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant and rolapitant have all been shown to be safe and effective in phase III clinical trials, with few adverse events (see Chapter 3) . Rolapitant does not induce CYP3A4 . To date, no definitive clinical trials have directly compared the efficacy and safety of the various NK-1 RAs . All patients in both arms received standard doses of dexamethasone . There appeared to be no significant differences in adverse events or in the prevention of CINV between NEPA and the aprepitant-ondansetron combination . A formal statistical comparison of the NEPA and aprepitant/ondansetron arms was not reported . For the present, the choice among these agents may be based on cost and the availability of oral or intravenous forms . Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy . At present there is no consensus as to whether to administer dexamethasone on days 2-3 . Low or minimally emetogenic chemotherapy . High-dose chemotherapy . The cause of CINV in this setting is multifactorial . Contributing causes include the use of prophylactic antibiotics, narcotic analgesics administered for the management of mucositis and total-body irradiation . A complete response (significant reduction in emesis without increasing toxicity or use of rescue medication) was demonstrated in 82% of those receiving aprepitant compared with 66% in those who did not . A total of 362 patients were available for the efficacy analysis, with 181 in each treatment arm . The complete response rate was significantly greater in the aprepitant group than the control group (58% vs 41%) . CINV in children . The incidence and severity of CINV in the pediatric age group is similar to that in adults . The use of antiemetics should follow the same principles as those used to treat adults . The use of corticosteroids has depended on the risk:benefit ratio in specific age groups and the particular chemotherapy regimen being used . Recently, aprepitant has been recommended for use in various age groups and various clinical applications . To date, there have been no studies in children with netupitant or rolapitant . 
An estimated 541 000 new cases of bladder cancer occurred globally in 2016, with 188 000 deaths . In the UK, approximately 10 100 new cases were diagnosed in 2014, accounting for 3% of all new cancer cases; bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the UK . Bladder cancer is more common in men than women, with a male-to-female incidence ratio of 4:1, although the incidence among women appears to be rising . The global age-standardized incidence is 14.1 per 100 000 person-years for men and 3.6 for women . Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men in the USA . Incidence increases with age, with a median age at presentation of over 75 years in the UK . Most cases of bladder cancer are non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancers, which can usually be cured; the 5-year survival rate for these cancers is more than 95% . However, invasive or metastatic bladder cancer is a frequent cause of cancer death, accounting for approximately 17 000 deaths annually in the USA and 188 000 globally . Age-standardized death rates for bladder cancer are 5.1 per 100 000 person-years in men and 1.5 per 100 000 person-years in women . Globally, bladder cancer is responsible for over 3 million disability-adjusted life-years, mainly years of life lost due to advanced disease . Many of these are avoidable, and as a result, many cases of bladder cancer could be prevented . Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to bladder carcinogenesis: 60-80% of patients with bladder cancer have a history of cigarette smoking and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 2-5-fold . This risk is particularly increased in individuals who have cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 fast metabolizer or N -acetyltransferase-2 slow-acetylation phenotypes . Cigar and pipe tobacco smoking are also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, although the effect size seems to be less than with cigarettes . No clear increase in the risk of bladder cancer has been reported in marijuana smokers . One cohort study suggested an inverse association, although a causal effect has not been established . Occupational risks . The strongest association between occupation and bladder cancer has been identified in workers of aniline dyes who are exposed to aromatic amines . Other occupations associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer due to carcinogen exposure are listed in Table 1.2 . Occupational risks have been reviewed by Rushton et al . The importance of dietary factors in the etiology of bladder cancer remains unclear . Caffeine has long been thought to be implicated in bladder cancer but the effects of confounding factors have been difficult to untangle . A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies concluded that coffee consumption was associated with a 33% increase in the odds ratio for development of bladder cancer, and the argument was strengthened by the finding that bladder cancer risk was increased in non-smoking coffee drinkers . Overall, the relationship has been hard to define because of the widespread use of caffeine and its association with other known carcinogens such as those associated with smoking . Various artificial sweeteners have been implicated as risk factors for bladder cancer but subsequent research has failed to confirm such links; the US Food and Drug Administration does not list any restrictions for artificial sweeteners with respect to bladder cancer risk . Long-term ingestion of drinking water contaminated with nitrate derived from fertilizers or human or animal waste has been linked with an increased risk of bladder cancer in postmenopausal women . A dose-response relationship is evident: cumulative doses above 20 g increase the risk 6-fold, and doses of 50 g or more increase the risk by 14.5-fold . Latency is relatively short - the time between exposure and subsequent bladder cancer diagnosis is 6-13 years . The risk of subsequent bladder cancer can be reduced in the oncology setting by minimizing the cumulative dose, although this is not always feasible . Pelvic irradiation for conditions such as cervical cancer has been linked to a 4-fold increase in the risk of bladder cancer . Chronic infection or inflammation due to indwelling suprapubic or Foley catheters in patients with spinal cord injury and other conditions has been linked to an increased incidence of bladder cancer, especially squamous cell cancer . Chronic kidney stones may also lead to chronic inflammation and an increased risk of bladder cancer . Most bladder cancers related to schistosomiasis have squamous cell histology although urothelial cancers also occur . 
The status of schizophrenia as a disease has been much debated . Core symptoms . The three-syndrome model was first proposed in the 1980s and has been confirmed in multiple subsequent studies . In the 1930s, the German psychiatrist Kurt Schneider reviewed many case records and listed eight symptoms that he considered diagnostic of schizophrenia . The presence and severity of negative symptoms are more critical to the prognosis than hallucinations and delusions . The latter can be similar in quality but result from a superimposed anxious or depressed mood, an impoverished understimulating environment or the adverse effects of antipsychotic medication . Behavioral disorganization - the third symptom complex - refers to a disruption in the associations among mood, thought and behavior . Inappropriate affect is the loss of connection between affect and thought (exempli gratia the patient who laughs while talking about the death of a loved one) . Bizarre behavior refers to the socially inappropriate or disorganized behavior frequently exhibited by people with schizophrenia . Diagnostic classification systems . The loosening of the diagnostic boundaries in schizophrenia became a concern in the early 1970s . This approach gives a menu of possible symptoms and specifies that a certain number should be present for a minimum duration before a diagnosis can be made . Current classification systems . The ICD-10 is mainly used outside North America; ICD-11 is expected in 2017 . In their definitions of schizophrenia, the two systems are similar . Both diagnose schizophrenia with inter-rater reliabilities of at least 0.8, which compares well with those for many other medical disorders . A classification of an acute form of schizophrenia in the ICD-10 is equivalent to a classification of schizophreniform disorder in the DSM-5 . There are two main changes from DSM-IV to DSM-5 . Secondly, the traditional subtypes such as paranoid, disorganized or catatonic have been dropped because of their poor reliability . Attenuated psychosis syndrome is included in Section 3 of DSM-5, meaning more research is required before it becomes adopted as a formal diagnosis . Research Domain Criteria: a systems-based approach . The five identified domains of interest are . Negative valence systems . Positive valence systems . Cognitive systems . Systems for social processes . Arousal and regulatory systems . Each domain is further divided into a number of subdomains . The primary purpose of RDoC is to provide a framework for the conduct of research . The use of the RDoC domains for clinical purposes, including diagnosis, will depend on the eventual demonstration of its real-world usefulness . Rating scales . It is an increasingly important function in service and treatment evaluation . The characteristics to look for in a rating scale are listed in Table 2.5 . Measurable dimensions of outcome and the most widely used rating scales used to make these assessments are detailed below . It comprises 30 items in three subscales that rate positive, negative and general symptoms, respectively . It takes about 20 minutes to administer . Symptomatic patients typically score between 60 and 120, and a score reduction of 20% is clinically meaningful . Social functioning is a less frequently measured, but very important, outcome . The Social Functioning Scale is probably the best instrument, although is not greatly sensitive to change . Global functioning can be estimated very simply using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) . Based on anchor points, this gives a single score from 0 to 100 that reflects how the person is functioning in general . However, its reliability is limited . Quality of life is an increasingly important concept, but the best way of measuring it is controversial . The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is probably the most widely used schizophrenia-specific scale . The QLS assesses four areas: interpersonal relations, instrumental role function, intrapsychic foundations, and common objects and activities . Cognitive function . The assessment of cognitive function and capacity has become increasingly important with the increased recognition of the role that cognitive impairments play in poor outcome . The gold standards for assessment are the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB; www . org) and the CANTAB (www . com), although these require training . The Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) is an interview-based assessment of cognitive function . 
Asthma exacerbations remain one of the major causes of morbidity in asthma . Fear of acute severe asthma is a major burden for many who live with severe asthma, and is a further reason for taking steps to prevent severe attacks . Any patient with asthma can suffer from an acute asthma episode, often described as an asthma attack . Inhalation of small allergen particles into the lower respiratory tract can cause a severe asthma episode and weather patterns can lead to epidemics of asthma in such circumstances . Similarly, severe food allergies (exempli gratia to peanuts or shellfish) may trigger asthma . While individuals with such a food allergy often present with signs of anaphylaxis, acute asthma is a major component of a severe food reaction for some and it requires recognition and treatment in its own right . Regular use of controller asthma medication substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of an acute asthma attack . Asthma exacerbations may occur in individuals with asthma who do not receive adequate controller treatment . Recognizing a severe attack . It is important for patients and clinicians alike to recognize the signs of a severe asthma attack and know when to seek further help . Patients can recognize a severe asthma attack by the frequency and severity of symptoms (Figure 6.1) . Asthma symptoms that recur and require bronchodilator treatment more frequently than once every 4 hours are an indication of an attack that requires medical treatment . Most often, patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma describe their asthma as being 'out of control' . Clinicians should assess the severity of an acute attack of asthma according to Table 6.1 . It is important to remember that asthma severity is classified according to the worst parameter . Management by the patient . For less severe attacks that do not require hospital presentation, the first step is to increase regular bronchodilator therapy (however, frequent symptoms and frequent requirement for bronchodilator suggest that further treatment is needed) . Less severe asthma attacks are diagnosed by frequent requirement for bronchodilator (up to once every 4 hours), night waking with asthma and breathlessness . For those with more severe asthma, prompt access to a supply of oral corticosteroids is important to prevent severe exacerbations, and such patients may keep a store of these medications at home . Hospital referral . Hospital referral is indicated for all patients who have persisting severe asthma or symptoms despite oral corticosteroid therapy and for those in whom asthma is severe (see Figure 6.1) . Patients with a history of severe or brittle (unpredictable and severe) asthma, intensive care admission, difficulties in accessing care or psychosocial problems may require hospital referral at an earlier stage . Admission to hospital enables the administration of parenteral asthma therapy and observation of a patient with severe airflow obstruction to ensure there is a response to asthma treatment, thereby ensuring patient safety . The hospital also provides an environment for ventilatory support if this is required . Most deaths of people with asthma occur out of hospital, usually in those with severe chronic asthma but also in some considered to have mild asthma . Treatment with bronchodilator medication in the absence of controller (preventer) treatments or overuse of bronchodilator medication is a particular risk factor for fatal asthma . Individuals with these features should be observed carefully and may require early referral to hospital . All patients who have been admitted to hospital with asthma should see a respiratory specialist . Treatment of acute severe asthma in hospital . Treatment of an acute exacerbation is based on the initial assessment of severity . The principles of acute asthma management in the emergency department are outlined in Figure 6.2 . For patients with life-threatening attacks, intensive care services should be sought . Patients not responding to treatment and stable within 2 hours should be considered for admission to hospital . In hospital . Acute asthma management in hospital is summarized in Figure 6.3 . Once a patient is admitted to hospital, monitoring and treatment should continue with . Ongoing review in hospital ensures recovery and introduces patients to their ongoing preventative medication and the management plan likely to be required following a hospital admission for asthma . All patients should leave hospital with medication, a written plan of what to do if their asthma worsens and a follow-up medical appointment for ongoing management . It is important that asthma control is assessed following a hospital admission and that ongoing maintenance medication is adjusted accordingly . 
Primary cutaneous lymphomas are defined as lymphomas without evidence of extracutaneous spread . CTCL are a rare group of T-cell malignancies primarily involving the skin . Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) is the term used when the patient presents with follicular lesions, id est patches, plaques or tumors with follicular accentuation (Figures 2.14 and 2.15) . These folliculotropic lesions may present with cysts, comedones (Figure 2.16) or milia (Figure 2.17), often with a predilection for the head and neck . Folliculotropic MF may present with lesions limited to patches of MF showing follicular accentuation +/− alopecia, +/− cysts, or with thick plaques and/or tumors with follicular accentuation often showing a predilection to the head and neck . Patients with lesions limited to follicular patches may have a similar prognosis to classical MF whilst those with dense follicular plaques have a poorer prognosis similar to those with advanced tumor stage classical MF . Granulomatous slack skin is a subtype of MF that presents with redundant folds of skin, typically in the flexor sites . Mycosis fungoides . Early disease . Early lesions may resolve when exposed to sunlight . Because of the difficulty in diagnosing MF, patients are often treated for eczema or psoriasis for months to years before the correct diagnosis is made . Hypopigmented MF is more common in children and black skin, and the malignant T cells are more frequently CD8+ . Some patches may become infiltrative and evolve into raised well-demarcated plaques . In addition to the physical disfiguration associated with these skin lesions, patients with MF experience itching (pruritus) and pain, which generally worsens in more advanced disease, all of which has a negative effect on quality of life . About 25% of patients will progress to advanced disease, with survival of 10-25 years . Advanced disease . About 30% of patients with MF develop tumors (Figures 2.6 - 2.11) or erythroderma (Figures 2.12 and 2.13) . Patients with these late-stage lesions tend to have rapidly progressive disease and a poor survival of 1-4 years, with spread to lymph nodes or internal organs (viscera) . Sézary syndrome (SS) is a form of CTCL that presents as advanced disease with erythroderma (Figure 2.19), lymphadenopathy and peripheral blood involvement . This leukemic form of CTCL is typically aggressive with a median survival of just 3 years . Patients experience extreme pruritus and often succumb to infection . Nail dystrophy is often striking (Figure 2.21) and can affect both the hands and feet, as can hyperkeratosis . Ectropion is a common finding in these patients as well . The combination of painful pruritic skin lesions, which may be cosmetically disfiguring, and an incurable disease, can severely negatively affect quality of life . Primary cutaneous anaplastic CD30+ large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) presents with rapidly enlarging skin tumors, often with central necrosis (Figure 2.22) . Systemic spread rarely occurs, but relapses in the skin are common . It most commonly presents as erythroderma, widespread papules and plaques and papular erythroderma . SPTCL is an indolent disease that is confined to the subcutis, presenting as solitary or multiple nodules and plaques . Although skin recurrences frequently occur, extracutaneous spread is rare . Systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue and weight loss may be present . It usually presents as a destructive midfacial tumor or as multiple plaques or tumors with ulceration on the trunk or extremities . Systemic symptoms and a hemophagocytic syndrome may be present . Early-stage lesions may be misdiagnosed as common dermatoses or fungal infections, such as . MF should be suspected if lesions do not respond to conventional treatment . Most forms of cutaneous lymphoma have a nodal counterpart: systemic nodal lymphomas may involve the skin during the disease course and, on occasions, may present with skin involvement . 
Cigarette smoking is the single most important factor in the development of COPD . Smoking cessation is therefore the single most important therapeutic intervention . The earlier a smoker quits, the more advantages accrue . These symptoms peak in the first few days following cessation and gradually decrease after 2-3 weeks . In this context, smoking is properly classified as a chronic, often relapsing, disease . Available therapies can nevertheless help a substantial minority of smokers to quit . Despite this, only 2% of smokers successfully quit spontaneously in a year . These steps ensure that smokers receive maximum encouragement to quit . Brief interventions should be implemented in all practices . Intensive interventions are appropriate for many patients with COPD . Brief interventions . Brief interventions can be highly effective for many smokers . This should be sympathetic and non-confrontational, and should provide patient-specific information . The five Rs can provide guidance in this respect (Table 6.3) . Every smoker ready to attempt to quit should be offered the highest probability of success . Non-pharmacological support, pharmacological treatment and follow-up all contribute to success . Behavioral support . Data show clearly that the more behavioral support offered the more likely a smoker is to quit . Many smokers, however, will not attend intensive behavioral programs . Brief behavioral help is therefore appropriate for most individuals and a number of approaches are shown in Table 6.4 . The efficacy of widely available telephone quit lines has been well demonstrated . In addition, some studies have suggested efficacy for the many internet-based interventions that have been developed . However, many of these do not have supporting evidence . Pharmacological treatment . Several other formulations are under investigation . All are similar in efficacy and approximately double quit rates compared with placebo, though they differ in clinical use . Many patients will therefore have had prior experience with these treatments . Withdrawal symptoms are believed to develop when nicotine levels fall below a certain threshold (Figure 6.2) . Therapy is then continued for 10 weeks to 6 months . The various formulations also have different pharmacokinetics . It is generally considered, however, that the health hazards associated with the gum are dramatically less than those associated with smoking . This use, while supported by several studies, is 'off-label' . The slow increase in dose reduces the incidence of nausea, which is the most common adverse effect . Other relatively common side effects include insomnia and abnormal dreams . It may be difficult to separate some of these symptoms from nicotine withdrawal . Varenicline has also been associated with drowsiness, and the label contains a warning for users of heavy machinery . Bupropion also acts directly on the CNS, and is in use as an antidepressant . It carries the same warning related to mood changes, depression and suicidality as varenicline . Second-line therapies include clonidine and nortriptyline . Physicians comfortable with this medication can consider it an aid to smoking cessation . The antidepressant nortriptyline has also been evaluated in several clinical trials, which have shown clinical efficacy . Electronic cigarettes and other recreational nicotine products . A number of non-cigarette nicotine-containing products have been introduced as consumer products . In contrast to pharmaceutical nicotine replacement, the safety of these products is generally untested . Currently, no data have demonstrated the efficacy of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid . Follow-up evaluations . Success in smoking cessation is closely linked to follow-up . Such assessments can deal with specific problems related to cessation and medication use, and can provide behavioral support . Additional follow-ups can also be beneficial . Intensive interventions . Intensive interventions are more elaborate than the brief interventions described above . Generally speaking, they require trained counselors and can be conducted either as individual or group sessions . Most often, multiple sessions are necessary . Only a minority of smokers referred for intensive programs will attend . Approach to system integration . Cigarette smoking should be regarded as a primary disease, and its treatment should be integrated into each healthcare system . This should include adequate training of personnel to interview patients for smoking status as a 'vital sign' . For more detailed information, see Fast Facts: Smoking Cessation . 
The prevalence of cigarette smoking varies from country to country, as do rates for men and women (Figure 2.1) . In countries such as the UK and the USA, rates are relatively low overall, and rates for women are slightly lower than those for men . However, in Asian and African countries the prevalence of smoking is much higher in men than in women . Within countries, smoking prevalence varies according to socioeconomic status and level of education . In high-income countries such as the UK and the USA, smoking rates are higher among less affluent and less well-educated groups . In the UK, the main cause of the socioeconomic gradient in smoking prevalence is a difference in the success of attempts to stop smoking . Thus, low-income smokers make the same number of quit attempts and want to stop just as much as higher-income smokers, but they are less likely to succeed . In other countries, different patterns may hold true . Ethnic differences in smoking prevalence are often accompanied by sex differences . In the UK, there is also a high prevalence of smoking in people of African-Caribbean descent . In the USA, native American communities have particularly high smoking rates (Figure 2.3) . Changes in smoking prevalence . At that time, most of the population smoked, whereas prevalence is now 20-30% . Figure 2.4 shows the decrease in smoking in men and women in Japan, the UK and the USA since the 1960s . It is widely thought that it will become increasingly difficult to reduce smoking prevalence in countries such as the USA and UK as the persisting smokers will be more 'hard core' . Moreover, as the prevalence of smoking has dropped, so has the daily cigarette consumption of the remaining smokers . The commonly held view in the UK and the USA that women are more likely to smoke than men is unfounded . In addition, male smokers tend to smoke more heavily than female smokers . In some other countries there is evidence of an increase, rather than a decrease, in smoking prevalence, as tobacco companies expand their markets . For example, prevalence seems to be rising in some countries in Eastern Europe . France has pulled back from strong anti-tobacco policies and this has been reflected by an increase in smoking rates . Daily smoking patterns . The majority of smokers smoke every day . In England, just under 90% of smokers smoke daily . In the USA, the proportion of non-daily smokers has increased to around 25%, and is highest in states with the lowest smoking prevalence and most active tobacco control policies . It should be noted that non-daily smokers do take in substantial amounts of nicotine - and probably, therefore, tobacco-related toxins from smoking . Further, non-daily smoking confers substantial health risks, especially from cardiovascular diseases . It is therefore misleading to report only daily smoking in the headline prevalence figures as is done in some countries such as Australia . About 70% of smokers smoke their first cigarette of the day within 30 minutes of waking, relating to a high propensity to 'nicotine hunger' (cigarette addiction, as discussed in more detail in Chapter 5) . Starting to smoke . In the USA and the UK, people most commonly start smoking at 13-16 years of age . The reasons why young people become smokers are complex . There is also evidence that children who suffer from depression are more likely to begin smoking, but the reverse is also true - non-depressed children who start to smoke are more likely to become depressed subsequently . Evidence on the influence of parental smoking is not as clear as one might expect . However, there is also evidence that becoming a regular smoker is linked to a genetic susceptibility . The heritability of take-up of regular smoking in western countries has been put at around 50% . Attitudes to smoking and beliefs about the risks and benefits of smoking are quite closely linked to smoking behavior in young people, but, interestingly, are not particularly useful as predictors of smoking uptake . Smokers' attitudes and attempts to stop smoking . Surveys in Europe and the USA consistently show that the majority of smokers would like to stop . Some smokers report that pressure from their children or spouse is a factor in the decision to try to stop . Other forms of tobacco use . In both the USA and the UK about 2% of men smoke pipes or cigars, but not cigarettes . Although the health risks from smokeless tobacco are substantially lower than those from smoking, they may nevertheless be significant . 
You only have a few minutes with each patient who comes to see you with an eye complaint, and (if you're a general practitioner) you probably have very little eye examination equipment . A careful history of the patient's eye symptoms plus looking for a few critical signs of serious disease will help you identify how urgently the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist, or whether you can treat them yourself . Always remember to examine both eyes . Eye anatomy . The main stages of an eye assessment are listed in Table 1.1 and are discussed in more detail below . Taking a history . Do you have blurred vision and, if so, is it in one or both eyes? . Do you have any other eye symptoms, for example, pain, sensitivity to light, flashes or floaters? . You will then need to ask about . the patient's ophthalmic history . the patient's medical and surgical history . any family history of eye problems . If something hit the eye, find out what it was and with what velocity it struck the eye . Red eye . Tracking symptom development . Ophthalmic history . A patient who has recently had eye surgery and presents with a red eye or blurred vision obviously needs urgent referral . Patients with a more remote history of eye disease or surgery are also more likely to develop problems in the future . Patients with a history of cold sores also have an increased risk of corneal ulcers . Medical and surgical history . Eyelid and eye surface examination . White light . Examine the eyes and eyelids with a flashlight and, if you have one, a magnifier (Figure 1.5a) . Are the eyes red? . Eyelid examination . Intraocular pressure testing . There are various methods of testing intraocular pressure; instruments that measure eye pressure are called tonometers . If there is a very high eye pressure in one eye (as in acute glaucoma) you can compare how both eyes 'feel' by gently pressing on the eyes through closed lids; in acute glaucoma the affected eye feels hard . The drops should not be used in patients with acute neurological problems . Finally, ask the patient to look directly at the light to view the macula . Slit-lamp examination is required to determine whether an eye is definitely 'normal' . There are many eye diseases, for example iritis, which can only be diagnosed with the slit lamp . When performing a basic eye examination you will need to assess . visual acuity (VA) . visual field . eye movements (if the patient has a 'turned eye' or double vision) . eye surface . individual components of the eye at higher magnification (by slit-lamp microscope, if available) . Visual field to confrontation . Testing the visual field (the entire sideways extent of vision for each eye) is also important, as this can lead to the detection of disease that would be missed if VA alone were tested . For example, a patient with a pituitary tumor can have a bitemporal hemianopia but still retain normal VA in each eye . To test the patient's right visual field to confrontation, sit directly in front of the patient and close your right eye (by shutting your eyelid, not by putting your hand over your eye) . Ask the patient, however, to cover their left eye with their left hand and stare into your left eye . You now have two hands available to test two of the four visual field quadrants of the patient's right eye at the same time . Ensure that you can see your fingers too, while staring at the patient's right eye . Ask the patient how many fingers in total you are holding up . Then repeat the procedure on the patient's left eye . There are many other tests for visual field, such as gradually bringing in a target from the periphery and asking the patient to tell you when they see it . Eye movements should be tested in patients who complain of double vision, or in children who present with a squint ('turned eye') . This should be performed for all patients complaining of blurred vision, flashes, floaters or visual field loss . A normal response is for each pupil to constrict when the light is shone on each eye in turn . 
The incidence of ovarian cancer varies markedly around the world: typically, the highest rates are seen in non-Hispanic white women, followed by Hispanic, African and Asian women (Figure 1.1) . In the UK, there were 7378 new cases of ovarian cancer in 2014, accounting for 2% of all new cancer cases . Ovarian cancer accounted for an estimated 152 000 deaths worldwide in 2012 . In the UK, approximately 4100 women died as a result of ovarian cancer in 2014, making it the fifth most common cause of cancer death among women . In the USA, it is anticipated that ovarian cancer will account for approximately 14 080 deaths in 2017 . The incidence of ovarian cancer begins to increase in women over 30-34 years of age, with the highest rates in women aged 65-69 years (Figure 1.2) . In the UK, 53% of cases diagnosed between 2012 and 2014 were in women aged 65 years or older . Furthermore, as noted above, the incidence of ovarian cancer varies markedly between ethnic groups . These findings clearly demonstrate the importance of genetic factors in ovarian cancer . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the strongest known genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer, accounting for around 65-85% of all cases of hereditary ovarian cancers . The cumulative lifetime ovarian cancer risk associated with these genes is 40-50% for BRCA1 and 20-30% for BRCA2 . Mismatch repair genes . Inherited mutations in mismatch repair genes are associated with an estimated cumulative risk of ovarian cancer of 6-12% . These genes account for 10-15% of hereditary ovarian cancers . Other genes implicated in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer include . Reproductive factors . In general, factors that decrease the number of ovulatory cycles reduce the risk of ovarian cancer . Oral contraceptive use . In a landmark analysis of 45 epidemiological studies, the use of oral contraceptives was associated with proportional reductions in the risk of ovarian cancer of 15-29% over 5 years . The protective effect of oral contraceptives increased with duration of use, and persisted for more than 30 years after discontinuation (Figure 1.4) . Environmental factors, including diet and obesity and exposure to talc, have been reported to influence the risk of ovarian cancer, but in many cases systematic reviews or meta-analyses have not demonstrated significant associations . Smoking was associated with an increased risk of mucinous cancers, but this was largely offset by a reduced risk of endometrioid cancers (see Chapter 2) . Close surveillance is recommended for women at high risk of the disease, especially those with BRCA mutations . Screening trials, as described below, have generally failed to demonstrate consistent effects on survival . Major trials of ovarian cancer screening . After a median follow-up of 11.1 years, ovarian cancer had been diagnosed in 1282 women (0.6%) . However, a prespecified analysis that excluded prevalent cases showed a significant 20% reduction in deaths from ovarian cancer among women receiving multimodal screening: the overall reduction was 8% in years 0-7 and 28% in years 7-14 . The participating women underwent ROCA-based screening every 4 months . Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy was encouraged throughout the study . Within a median follow-up period of 4.8 years, 4348 women underwent 13 728 women-years of screening . There was a significant shift toward earlier stages of the disease being detected within 1 year of screening: only 36.8% of the 19 cancers diagnosed within 1 year of screening were stage IIIb-IV compared with 94.4% of the 18 cancers diagnosed more than 1 year after screening ended (Figure 1.6) . The study established ROCA-based screening as an option for women at high risk of ovarian cancer who defer or decline risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, given its high sensitivity and significant stage shift . However, whether this strategy would improve survival in screened high-risk women has yet to be proven . Participants were followed for up to 13 years . Screening had no significant effect on the incidence of deaths from ovarian cancer (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.82-1.71), but surgery following false-positive diagnoses was associated with serious complications in 15% of patients . On the basis of these results, the US Preventative Services Task Force concluded that ovarian cancer screening should not be offered to women at low risk of the disease . 
Within the clinical space . Clinical care is familiar to most readers from their own experiences with doctors, hospitals and other parts of the healthcare system . Historically, its primary purpose has been to address health problems, and it has long been grounded in the interaction between a patient and a healthcare provider . There has been varying progression of healthcare activities toward preventive care and the maintenance of wellness . With the introduction of connected technologies, there have also been attempts to move healthcare activities into the home, decreasing the need for face-to-face interactions with providers . Clinical care activities include a wide range of diagnostic and treatment processes and procedures, such as . real-time monitoring - for example, with continuous blood glucose sensors . tools to support medical adherence, such as smart apps and pill dispensers . physical rehabilitation tools, such as digital activity trackers . The federal regulations define research as a 'systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge' . When a person (exempli gratia patient or healthy individual) volunteers to enroll in clinical research, they are called a research participant . There are rules and guidance that must be followed when conducting clinical research to make sure that research participants are protected from undue risks of harm . Clinical research comes in two broad subsets . In interventional studies, participants receive some form of treatment, education or support (Box 2.1) . Clinical trials are a subset of interventional studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention . In non-interventional studies, participants do not receive an intervention . Non-interventional studies include observational, exploratory, survey, case-control, cohort and correlational studies . Computational studies that use existing data sources to build predictive models fall into this category . Outside the clinic walls . Like any other medical tool, at-home monitoring technologies need to prove their worth . Developers, working with researchers and other experts, must demonstrate that these tools produce clinically meaningful information that leads to clinically meaningful improvements in care, processes and outcomes . Digital measurement in medicine will not replace clinics or clinicians entirely, nor would we want them to . The delivery of, for example, intravenous drugs or surgery, and the value that patients place on their relationship with their provider, cannot be replaced by digital tools . Nonetheless, when used appropriately, digital measurements can improve care by giving clinicians more complete information . Also, transferring some practices out of the clinic and into patients' regular lives - for example, passively measuring sleep quality with wearables instead of requiring overnight stays in clinics - can enhance access to care and reduce cost . Continuous at-home monitoring also raises a new set of practical issues . who will monitor the data? . who will be responsible for acting on it if it indicates a need for action? . how will providers be compensated for these tasks? . Although organizations like the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) have made inroads in addressing the first two questions, the field will need to address these issues and adopt consensus solutions for these tools to be truly integrated into clinical care . A defining moment for any medical product, whether drug or device, is when the product goes to market . From this perspective, the industry splits into 'premarket' research activities, drug and device development in the life sciences and biotech, and 'postmarket' commercial activities, where the products are used in clinical applications like in the hospital . Often, government regulators like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) are the gatekeepers between what is considered research (premarket) and what is part of standard of care and commercial activities (postmarket) . National governments are responsible for establishing national medicines and medical device standards and regulatory authorities that determine what claims product manufacturers can make when they go to market in that country . As of 2015, 121 of the 194 members of the World Health Organization had a national regulatory authority responsible for implementing and enforcing product regulations specific to medical devices . For example, in the USA, the FDA serves this function . Across the Atlantic, this oversight is provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) . 
Recording and using smoking as a vital sign . Smoking is linked to so many diseases that recording it is imperative in the diagnosis of a condition and in deciding its management . Failing to record smoking status and acting on the result is considered by leading professional organizations such as the UK's Royal College of Physicians and the American Medical Association to be tantamount to negligence . Smoking history is important in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . Advising patients to stop . It is now recognized that all clinicians have a role to play in encouraging and aiding smoking cessation . Research has shown that brief opportunistic advice from a physician can trigger an attempt to stop smoking in about 40% of cases . If the smoker then attempts to quit with no treatment, he or she has only a 5% chance of long-term success . Hence, the overall effect of the physician's advice alone (without assistance) is to create one long-term ex-smoker for about every 50 people advised . Taking into account the cost savings on smoking-related illness and time off work, brief advice to stop smoking actually results in a cost saving . First of all, there may be a risk that repeatedly raising the subject of smoking with a patient may undermine the doctor-patient relationship, adversely affecting adherence to treatment regimens for other conditions and even causing a smoker to avoid seeing the doctor . Second, without effective treatment for nicotine dependence (see below), it is mostly less-dependent smokers who stop in response to brief advice from their physician . The more-dependent smokers are in greater need of stopping but are less likely to do so . Third, the law of diminishing returns appears to apply, so that smokers who have not responded to previous advice are less likely to respond the next time it is given . For these reasons, national and international professional guidelines suggest that physicians aim to raise the issue of smoking with patients known to be smokers at least once a year . The goal is to trigger a quit attempt in as many smokers as possible and to encourage as many smokers as possible to use effective treatments to help that quit attempt succeed . The first task is to check whether the smoker has already given up (Figure 6.1) . If not, then rather than berating the smoking or even advising the patient to stop, the evidence suggests that clinicians should just advise smokers that there are now effective methods to help with quitting and encourage the smoker to try one of these . If the smoker is not interested, the clinician simply closes the conversation by inviting the smoker to think about quitting and to get in touch if he or she changes his or her mind . Note that this is very different from the traditional approach of advising smokers to stop and then talking about different methods of stopping if they show an interest . It seems that better results are obtained and the interaction with the patient is more positive if the clinician simply advises all patients about the best ways of stopping if they want to and encourage them to use one of them . If the smoker expresses an interest in stopping, attention switches to enhancing the efficacy of the quit attempt through treatment . The clinician should refer the smoker to a trained stop-smoking specialist (whether in-person services or those offered via telephone) if one is available, as he or she will be able to provide the full range of help . This may require nothing more than providing the smoker with a card or leaflet showing the telephone number . Smokers should also be encouraged to use pharmacological treatment (discussed below) . If a trained specialist is not available but the physician is trained and can provide behavioral support, a schedule of appointments can be made to provide this help and support . If, however, the physician does not have the training or time to provide behavioral support, he or she should discuss appropriate medication and provide whatever help and support he or she can . When discussing medication with the patient, the clinician needs to recognize that many smokers have already tried nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline (Champix/Chantix) . Training in smoking cessation and knowledge of the effects of smoking . As well as having a vital role in encouraging smokers to stop, referring them to cessation treatment services and prescribing medication to aid the quit attempt, clinicians must also be aware of the wide range of interactions between smoking and the clinical conditions that they manage . Smoking is not covered particularly well in undergraduate or postgraduate medical education . Several useful resources are available to assist in educating clinicians about smoking . National guidelines are also available (see Key references) . 
Large-scale community studies in Canada and elsewhere show that this association remains after controlling for factors such as age, sex and social support . The presence of depression together with medical illness has important implications for the individual, their carers and for health services and society . This combination has complex and extensive effects, involving negative impact on illness course and disability, the uptake of treatments, risk of complications and death rates . This increased risk remains after adjusting for confounding factors . Pathways and directions . The association between depression and physical health problems could operate through several different pathways . Medical illness may predict and play a causal influence in the development of depression . Medical illness may present with depressive symptoms . It is likely that the association involves several mechanisms that may act and interact simultaneously, and many of the linkages appear to be bi-directional . Depression as a predictor of physical illness . Cohort studies conducted in the USA and Japan also show that depression is an independent risk factor for stroke . There is weaker evidence that links depression to the incidence of cancer and hypertension . There seem to be two main mechanisms involved in linking depression to later medical illness and to worsened outcomes from these illnesses, such as increased mortality . Physical illness predicting depression . The effects of disability as a risk factor for depression are most commonly identified in older people, but appear to operate across the age range . Although a range of factors is likely to be involved, persistent pain has been found to be an important predictor of depression . Medical illness presenting as depression . Endocrine disorders, autoimmune disorders, malignancies, anemia and vitamin deficiencies can present in this manner . Additional linkages: predisposing factors and treatment side effects . Research evidence indicates that genetically influenced pathways linking these conditions are highly likely, and that - as for many other health problems - there is an interaction between multiple genetic factors and environmental factors . Patterns of coping and ways of responding to stressors that develop in the first years of life and are powerfully influenced by early environment appear to act as further predisposing and perpetuating factors for these health problems . Additionally, depressive disorders can occur primarily as a side effect of the treatment of a physical disorder . Commonly prescribed medications such as analgesics, antihypertensive drugs, steroids, antiparkinsonian agents and interferon treatment for hepatitis C may have this potential adverse effect . On the other hand, antidepressant medications are associated with weight gain and metabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance and elevated serum lipid concentrations in vulnerable patients, and these drugs have also been linked to hypertension and decreased bone mineral density . Chronic diseases . This is a group of non-communicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, COPD and end-stage renal disease . For all these conditions, there is a two- to threefold increased prevalence of depression compared with the unaffected population . Approaches to assessment and management . The global changes in the distribution and prevalence of chronic illnesses will have important effects on the level and focus required of our health policies and services . There is a clear need for better integration of mental health assessment and practice across the healthcare system . The patient's expectations and attitudes influence the help-seeking process, and stigma and uncertainty about psychological problems may lead to medical illness features being expressed more freely than emotional difficulties . The clinician may similarly be more comfortable with eliciting physical rather than psychological problems . Limited consultation duration and the means of service payment or reimbursement may additionally steer the encounter towards the review and management of medical conditions . Possible confusion arising from multiple causes of symptoms has led some workers to advocate discounting physical symptoms when assessing comorbid depression . However, the evidence from investigations of the validity of diagnostic practice indicates that modifications to depression criteria are not an appropriate response to these problems . A number of depression case identification (or screening) tools are available to assist practice in this area . A simply administered two-question screen appears to have excellent sensitivity, and is an appropriate tool for initial assessment and routine monitoring (see Table 4.2) . Recognition of depression is covered in more detail in Chapter 4 . Recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence notes that selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are an appropriate first line drug treatment . Sertraline and citalopram are the probable drugs of first choice on the basis of lower interaction potential and safety in relation to cardiac events . Chapter 6 explores treatment options in greater detail . 
Known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, these therapies target the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and the CTLA-4 receptor . PD-1 is an inhibitory cell-surface receptor that is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes and dendritic cells . The effector function of T cells that express PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment can be suppressed when PD-1 is coupled to the ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) or PD-L2 (B7-DC) on tumor cells, thus preventing an immune attack on the cancer . Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) prevents the inhibition of the effector T-cell function, allowing T cells to maintain their tumor cell killing function (Figure 5.1) . The PD-1 inhibitors are immunoglobulin (Ig)G4 isotypes, while the PD-L1 inhibitors are IgG1 isotypes and are able to bind C1q and activate the complement pathway . The highest level of PD-L1 expression (more than 50% of tumor cells) appears to have the greatest predictive value, which is seen in about 30% of NSCLC tumors (see page 47) . Among the patients with at least 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, pembrolizumab resulted in significantly longer PFS and OS than docetaxel, suggesting PD-L1 has value as a predictive biomarker . In the POPLAR study, atezolizumab was compared with docetaxel in 287 patients with pretreated NSCLC . The ongoing OAK study will validate the efficacy of atezolizumab in patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC independently of PD-L1 positivity in tumor tissue . Safety, tolerability and efficacy appear to be similar across all PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors; about 10% of patients experience grade 3-4 adverse events . Immune-related adverse events are a concern, as they can occur idiosyncratically, unlike chemotherapy toxicity . Grade 3-5 immune-related adverse events in 1% or more of patients were pneumonitis (2%) and severe skin reactions (1-2%) . In addition to the data in treatment-naive patients generated from phase I expanded cohorts, there are now specific first-line monotherapy studies . These randomized phase III studies are comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone with current platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimens, as summarized in Table 5.3 . Adjuvant and neoadjuvant studies . Combination therapy with chemotherapy . Early data show impressive response rates, ranging from 33% to 55% in CHECKMATE-012, 30% to 58% in KEYNOTE-021, and 67% in early-phase atezolizumab studies . The concern with combining these therapies is toxicity, with reports of grade 3-4 adverse events ranging from 27% (KEYNOTE-021) to 45% (CHECKMATE-012) . While the response rates are certainly high with these combinations, the toxicities also appear to be increased . Combination therapy with other checkpoint inhibition . However, there is potential for synergism by combining CTLA-4 inhibition with blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis . Toxicity is a concern given the immune-related adverse events that have been seen with CTLA-4 antagonists . KEYNOTE-021 combined pembrolizumab with ipilimumab in a dose escalation study in patients already treated with platinum chemotherapy . The data suggest that the combination has acceptable toxicity and robust responses . Similar results have been seen with the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab, including in patients with PD-L1-negative disease; several combination studies are ongoing . Combination therapy with small molecule inhibitors . This would suggest that oncogenic drivers induce immune escape in NSCLC through PD-L1 upregulation . Preclinical and early phase clinical data from KEYNOTE-001 suggest that prior therapy with EGFR inhibitors is associated with a lack of response to PD-1 inhibition . From early results, the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and EGFR inhibition appears to be safe, as suggested by the results from the combination of gefitinib and durvalumab . Combination therapy with radiotherapy . 
Optimal treatment . Behavioral support . The key elements are . sessions before the quit date . a specified quit date . a clear target of total abstinence . sessions at least weekly . sessions for at least 4 weeks after the quit date . discussion of a range of motivational devices to overcome urges to have a cigarette . use of social motivation to enhance and maintain commitment . education about situations that may provoke relapse . presentation of a variety of means for coping with these situations . recording of expired-air carbon monoxide to confirm abstinence at sessions after the quit date . The following sections give a flavor of what the various sessions might involve . Assessment session . Approaching the quit date . These might include making a verbal and/or written statement to the therapist or in front of the group . After the quit date . This serves two functions . It serves to boost the smoker's motivation by demonstrating improvement in a physiological marker . Issues relating to the medication can also be discussed where appropriate . Preventing relapse . The program of support can be given face-to-face or by scheduled telephone contacts . Depletion of dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens has been implicated in urges to smoke . Bupropion reduces the severity of withdrawal symptoms and the urge to smoke . As a partial agonist, it increases activation in downstream neural pathways . Other meta-analyses have not shown a significant increase in such events . Nicotine-replacement therapy is available in various forms, not all of which are available in all countries . All forms of NRT have been shown to reduce craving and withdrawal symptoms . Nicotine lozenges are available in two formulations . Novartis market a 1 mg lozenge which is yet to undergo clinical trials . The nicotine is absorbed through the lining of the mouth, as it is from nicotine gum . In both cases, the lozenges proved effective . Several different patch technologies are available, but the essential principle is that nicotine is absorbed through the skin from a reservoir . There is no evidence of damage to the nasal membranes, even with long-term use . The cartridge is held in a plastic device like a cigarette holder . The user sucks air through the cartridge, where it draws off nicotine vapor . This means that the rate of nicotine delivery is similar to that with nicotine gum . They are placed on the tongue and dissolve within a few minutes . Enhancing the effectiveness of nicotine-replacement therapy . Who can benefit from pharmacological treatment? . Efficacy with non-daily smokers has not yet been demonstrated . Smoking reduction . Unfortunately, there is little evidence that this in itself results in a meaningful reduction in risk . Electronic nicotine delivery devices . In England, where usage is tracked every month (www . info) they are now the most popular aid to cessation and to smoking reduction . ENDS appear to be gaining greater popularity, which may allow them to make a substantial positive impact on population health . Clinicians are frequently asked whether they would recommend e-cigarettes . Major brands may have better control of manufacturing quality . Other treatments . Acupuncture has also been studied but was not found to have any specific effect . St John's wort contains pharmacologically active compounds that might be expected to affect smoking . For example, it contains a chemical that inhibits the body's ability to break down nicotine . However, at present there are no published trials showing a benefit in aiding permanent smoking cessation . It is cheap, and has been recommended for this use in New Zealand and the Netherlands . A great advantage is that, like nortriptyline, cytisine is extremely cheap . In Poland it is sold over the counter and is the most commonly used smoking cessation medication . Special patient groups . Pregnant smokers . Stopping smoking at any stage in pregnancy improves the health of the fetus compared with continuing to smoke . Hospital inpatients . Psychiatric patients . Individuals with alcohol use disorder are very likely to smoke, and to smoke heavily . Young smokers . This is currently an active area of research . 
To accurately diagnose acute pancreatitis (AP) and its complications, consensus definitions are needed . In 1993, a clinically based classification system was published following an international symposium on AP held in Atlanta in 1992 . The Atlanta classification was considered a revolution, a standard that made it possible to compare studies on AP . In 2013, a new consensus updated the Atlanta classification: the revision of the Atlanta classification (RAC) . Local complications . Interstitial acute pancreatitis is characterized by a localized or diffuse enlargement of the pancreas due to inflammatory edema . Some patients with interstitial AP may develop acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFCs) (see page 42 . The clinical course of interstitial AP, if not complicated by APFCs, is usually uneventful, with a quick recovery, very low morbidity and no mortality . Necrotizing acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma, the peripancreatic fat, or both . Pancreatic necrosis is defined by a lack of pancreatic parenchymal enhancement by intravenous contrast agent on a CT scan (Figure 5.1) . The CT signs and definitive extension of pancreatic necrosis may take several days to establish, so imaging before the fourth day from disease onset may underestimate the presence of pancreatic necrosis . Peripancreatic necrosis is characterized by a heterogeneous and non-liquid density collection in the peripancreatic fat tissue . Collections arising in the first 4 weeks following disease onset lack a defined wall . The RAC defines the following acute collections on the basis of their content . An APFC is defined as peripancreatic fluid (a homogeneous collection with fluid density with no intrapancreatic extension) associated with interstitial edematous pancreatitis with no associated peripancreatic necrosis . Therefore, this is typically a complication of interstitial AP . MRI and ultrasonography are more accurate in detecting solid necrotic tissue in collections than a CT scan (Figure 5.2) . Collections persisting after 4 weeks . Collections that have not been reabsorbed over the first 4 weeks develop an encapsulating wall . According to the RAC, these mature collections can be classified in the following ways . Pseudocyst: an encapsulated collection of fluid with a well-defined inflammatory wall, usually outside the pancreas with minimal or no necrosis (homogeneous fluid density on imaging) . The collection can be intrapancreatic and/or extrapancreatic . Infected pancreatic necrosis is discussed in Chapter 7 (see page xxx) . Other local complications . In the RAC, gastric outlet dysfunction, splenic and portal vein thrombosis, and colonic necrosis are considered as other local complications of AP, although no formal definitions are provided . Systemic complications . Organ failure . The RAC uses the validated modified Marshall scoring system to define OF in the respiratory, cardiovascular and renal systems (Table 5.1) . OF can be classified in a number of ways . According to time of onset: early OF develops during the first week after disease onset and is most frequently due to uncontrolled production of proinflammatory mediators as a consequence of the inflammation of the pancreas and surrounding tissues . Late OF, developing after the first week, is usually a consequence of infection of pancreatic necrosis or other nosocomial infections . According to its duration: OF can be classified as transient if it resolves within 48 hours, or persistent if it lasts for more than 48 hours, as discussed in Chapter 4 (see page 35) . Patients with transient OF have increased morbidity but very low mortality, whereas patients with persistent OF have maximum morbidity and 50% mortality . According to the number of organs involved: the RAC defines multiple OF as OF affecting more than one organ, a situation also associated with 50% mortality . Classification of severity . Patients with persistent OF have a high risk of mortality, indicating severe disease . The RAC therefore promotes a three-category classification (Table 5.2) . mild disease with an uneventful clinical course . moderately severe disease with increased morbidity but a low risk of mortality . severe disease with maximum morbidity and a high risk of mortality . 
The FDA has approved many targeted therapies and immunotherapies with companion diagnostic tests (see next page) . NGS is now approved to screen and diagnose many of these targetable abnormalities, and the technologies are steadily being applied to guide therapeutic decision-making . The FDA has publicized mechanisms for the regulatory approval of NGS . Level 1, companion diagnostics . A companion diagnostic is a test that informs the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapy . Level 2, cancer mutations with evidence of clinical significance . Tests for cancer mutations allow physicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions . Analytic and clinical validity should be demonstrated, the latter through clinical evidence such as professional guidelines or peer-reviewed publications . Level 3, cancer mutations with potential clinical significance . These are mutations that do not fall within level 1 or 2 . The variants are informational or used to direct patients toward clinical trials . Molecular tumor boards . See Chapter 6 for further discussion . Current landscape . The test analyzes DNA isolated from FFPE tumor tissue specimens . Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC can be carried out to provide additional information for immunotherapy selection . FoundationOne Heme is a comprehensive genomic profiling test that combines DNA and RNA sequencing of 406 and 265 genes, respectively . It is used for patients with hematologic malignancies, sarcomas or solid tumors for which RNA sequencing is required . The test allows sensitive detection of translocations and fusions . TMB and MSI are also reported . TruSight Oncology 500 is a pan-cancer assay that identifies known and emerging biomarkers . The assay uses both DNA and RNA from tumor samples to identify somatic variants, including small variants, gene fusions and splice variants . It can also measure TMB and MSI . The assay covers a large number of genes as well as 1.94 megabases of the genome to measure TMB . It also provides information on MSI . DNA and RNA are prepared in parallel with an integrated workflow following DNA shearing/cDNA synthesis . Liquid biopsy is a method of detecting biomarkers in blood for prognostic and predictive purposes . ctDNA-based liquid biopsies are currently under investigation . Current challenges include standardization, sensitivity and specificity . Clinical basket trials and umbrella designs . Traditionally, oncology Phase I clinical trials were conducted with a mixture of solid tumors, and Phase II and III oncology trials were histopathology based . These can be categorized as basket and umbrella trials, depending on the design (Figure 4.2) . In an umbrella trial, participants have a single histology and multiple biomarkers are each matched to different treatments . The primary endpoint for MATCH is the percentage of patients whose tumors have a complete or partial treatment response . Early data show positive results in three cohorts of patients, described below . Colorectal cancer patients with BRAF p . The combination of the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib and the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib showed antitumor activity in a cohort of heavily pretreated patients . Colorectal cancer patients with an HER2 (ERBB2) amplification . Colorectal cancer patients with high TMB . It provides integrated clinical research support in an international setting involving top-level university hospitals from the EORTC network . This is particularly important for patients with rare cancers, for which Phase II and III trials are unlikely to be conducted . I-PREDICT utilized tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies . The investigators found that it was viable to administer customized multidrug regimens, with 49% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment . The findings indicate that treating molecularly complex and heterogeneous malignancies with combinations of customized agents could offer a means of improving outcomes over those achieved with the current approach, which pairs one driver mutation with one drug . However, additional studies are needed to confirm the findings . Patients are allocated to separate baskets according to their tumor type and gene fusion . Potential cost benefit and reimbursement . Models of cost-effectiveness need to be developed so that they can be usefully applied to emerging targeted treatments and immunotherapy agents . These models should be the basis for obtaining reimbursement approval for the newly developed NGS platforms . 
Brain metastases (BM) are common in the natural history of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, with advances in imaging modalities and improvements in systemic disease control, both the incidence and prevalence of BM are rising . BM have deleterious effects on many critical neurological functions . The DS-GPA score has a central role in the management of patients; focal interventions should preferentially be delivered to patients with a good prognosis . Radiation therapy, surgery and systemic therapies are options for the management of metastatic lesions in the brain . BM typically appear as contrast-enhanced lesions on CT or MRI (sequence T1 with gadolinium) . An algorithm for the management of BM is shown in Figure 7.1 . In small randomized trials in patients with a single metastatic brain lesion, surgery plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) increased survival compared with WBRT alone . Conversely, in another small randomized trial, no survival benefit was demonstrated . Nowadays, surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the tumor bed is an option . SRS decreases the likelihood of local relapse after resection . No randomized trials have addressed the role of surgery for multiple lesions, and retrospective data are conflicting . As 7-10% of patients who undergo surgery suffer from major complications, candidates should be selected cautiously . Whole brain radiation therapy continues to be the standard of care for patients with a poor prognosis according to the DS-GPA (id est patients who are not candidates for surgery or SRS) with multiple (more than 3-5) BM . Well-established acute side effects of WBRT, which are not typically associated with SRS (see below), include alopecia, dermatitis and asthenia . Strategies to overcome neurocognitive impairment after WBRT include hippocampus-sparing WBRT or neuroprotective agents . In a large randomized trial (RTOG 9508), an SRS boost increased survival in patients with a good prognostic score and a single lesion . Although no randomized trials have directly compared surgery to SRS, SRS seems to provide a similar local control rate (80-90%), especially when SRS is combined with WBRT . Thus, SRS is now generally performed without WBRT in patients with a limited number of lesions (up to 3) . SRS without WBRT is feasible as the initial treatment for patients with 5-10 BM . SRS leads to radiation necrosis in approximately 10% of patients, especially those who receive combined (WBRT+SRS) radiation . It can be difficult to distinguish between radiation necrosis and recurrent BM on conventional MRI . Systemic therapies . Glucocorticoids improve symptoms in up to 75% of patients with cerebral edema and are indicated in patients with neurological symptoms . The order of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often dictated by how symptomatic a patient is and their performance status (PS) . Radiotherapy is often used for very symptomatic patients with poor PS . Systemic treatment is usually the first choice for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic BM, particularly if a sensitizing driver mutation is present in the tumor . Concurrent WBRT and chemotherapy resulted in higher neurocognitive deficit without clear benefit in response rate or survival . European Society Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines and data from randomized trials support chemotherapy as a reasonable first-line treatment option for patients with stage IV NSCLC and asymptomatic BM . Chemotherapy may also be proposed as a salvage treatment . Targeted therapies . A substantial percentage of patients have been found to have specific somatic genetic alterations underlying their tumors that can be targeted by specific molecular compounds (see Chapter 8) . Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have antitumor activity in patients with NSCLC BM . A high incidence of BM is seen in patients who have NSCLC with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement (40%) . Patients with BM from ALK -rearranged NSCLC who are treated with radiotherapy (SRS and/or WBRT) and crizotinib may have prolonged survival . It is therefore reasonable to propose the use of targeted molecular compounds as first-line treatment for selected patients with stage IV NSCLC and asymptomatic BM . 
Genetic factors . The most potent risk factor for eating disorders is female gender (see Chapter 2) . This association is likely to reflect biological as well as psychosocial factors . Family studies indicate that first-degree relatives of patients with anorexia have an increased prevalence of eating disorders (Table 3.1), and that first-degree relatives of patients with bulimia or binge-eating disorder appear to be at increased risk of eating disorders, mood disorders and substance abuse . Similar to other complex disorders, the eating disorders are likely to have a polygenic etiology, each gene having a relatively small effect . Physiological factors . Childhood obesity is a risk factor for bulimia and binge-eating disorder . A pear-shaped body and relatively high amounts of body fat may also predispose to eating disorders . Around 20% of individuals with diabetes mellitus develop an eating disorder . Patients with type 1 diabetes are more likely to develop anorexia or bulimia, while patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop binge-eating disorder . Neurobiological factors . These functional abnormalities could maintain some of the eating disorder behaviors . Family functioning . Historically, the role of dysfunctional styles of family interaction was put forward in theories of the development of eating disorders . parental attitudes toward eating, weight and body shape . parental eating and weight-related behavior modeled in the home . Perceived pressure to be thin, family criticism regarding weight, and maternal investment in slenderness predict eating disturbances in adolescents . Furthermore, families of individuals with anorexia tend to have a higher rate of parental eating disorders, family dieting and adverse comments from family members about eating, weight or appearance . The families of individuals with bulimia are often more chaotic and conflicted . A wide range of other childhood adversities and stressful life events has been associated with eating problems during adolescence . The effects of stress on eating are not uniform . Developmental factors . It is still debatable whether there is a correlation between eating problems in early childhood and those in adolescence . The demographics of early feeding problems suggest no association, because boys are more likely to exhibit disordered eating in early childhood, whereas girls are at greater risk in adolescence . Mothers of patients with eating disorders have reported reliance on scheduled feeding and prematurely introduced solids more frequently than controls . Early maladaptive eating patterns were associated with a greater likelihood of problems later in life . Picky eating and digestive problems predicted preanorexic behavior . Early eating problems were also a predictor of the future onset of bulimia . Body-image distortions in this age group are associated with dieting and weight concerns . Prepuberty and adolescence . Studies have also confirmed that eating problems emerge in response to pubertal change, especially fat accumulation . Girls who feel most negatively about their bodies at puberty are at a higher risk of developing eating difficulties . Several studies have identified associations between disturbed eating in adolescents and . weight concerns . discomfort about discussing problems with parents . maternal preoccupation with diets . The biological changes of puberty certainly contribute to the onset of eating disorders . Individual variables . Intrapersonal factors . Similarly, the risk for bulimia is increased by the presence of overanxious disorder or social phobia relative to controls . Body-image disturbance is a well-known risk factor for clinical and subclinical levels of eating disorders . However, body-image disturbance seems to be more closely related to restricted eating, and global psychological functioning more closely related to bulimia . Body dissatisfaction is not only a defining characteristic of eating disorders but also a contributing factor in their development and maintenance . Interpersonal functioning . Impulse behaviors and substance abuse . These problematic behaviors are often overlooked on initial contact . The pattern of impulsive behaviors associated with bulimia is not common in those with anorexia . When treating a patient with either an eating disorder or a substance-abuse problem, the clinician should always consider the possibility of a comorbid substance-abuse or eating problem . Biological factors have been investigated in terms of the genetic contributions to alcoholism, drug abuse and eating disorders . The origins of eating disorders are widely seen as a complex combination of biological and environmental factors . Various genetic, developmental, psychological, familial and social variables have been suggested as risk factors . 
Post-transplant lymphomas . Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of normal B cells will lead to a sustained lymphoproliferation unless controlled by CD8+ T cells . In practice, the malignant potential of such lymphoproliferations (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders [PTLDs]) is variable; some cases are clinically aggressive, however, and may be thought of as a form of high-grade lymphoma . The incidence of PTLDs following solid-organ or bone-marrow transplantation depends on a number of factors including the depth of immunosuppression achieved . In renal transplantation, the incidence is thought to be about 2% . There is a bimodal distribution of incidence . EBV-positive PTLDs are most common within the first year of transplantation (especially in EBV-negative patients with an EBV-positive donor), whereas EBV-negative disease peaks at 10 years . Overall, approximately 60% of PTLD cases are EBV-positive . The World Health Organization (WHO) describes three subtypes . polymorphic PTLD . Usually, both early and polymorphic disease occur soon after a transplant and are EBV-positive . There are several subtypes of monomorphic disease such as diffuse large B-cell type, Burkitt type and Hodgkin type . The tumor may arise in donor- or recipient-derived B cells, though recipient-derived PTLDs are much more common . Clinical presentation of PTLD is highly variable . Patients may present with systemic symptoms, such as weight loss, fever or night sweats, or simply with lymphadenopathy . The common extranodal presentation of this condition means that any organ of the body may be affected including the central nervous system (CNS) . The most common extranodal site is the gastrointestinal tract . Simply reducing the level of immunosuppression may allow sufficient resurgence of normal T cells to control proliferating B cells . The success of this approach appears to be more likely in tumors that occur early after transplantation . For more aggressive tumors, single-agent rituximab may be effective, although additional combination chemotherapy is often necessary . HIV-associated lymphoma . The association of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with HIV-1 has been known since 1985 . There are several well-recognized ways in which HIV-associated lymphomas present . The most common presentation is systemic lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Burkitt type . Extranodal disease is more common than in HIV-negative patients . As with other forms of HIV-associated lymphoma, EBV positivity is a frequent finding . Primary CNS lymphoma may occur in the context of very low CD4 counts . Clearly, with better HIV treatment the incidence of this form of HIV-associated lymphoma is diminishing . The rarest HIV-associated lymphoma is the so-called 'body cavity' or primary effusion lymphoma, which is also associated with human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) coinfection . These lymphomas are aggressive and present in the late stages of HIV infection, causing the accumulation of ascites and pericardial and pleural effusions . Plasmablastic lymphoma occurs almost exclusively in patients with HIV, and presents with lesions affecting the jaw and oral mucosa, although other extranodal sites may be involved . They are CD20−, extremely aggressive and the majority of patients will die of their lymphoma despite intensive chemotherapy . Treatment of HIV-associated lymphoma is directed by its pathological subtype . These patients are at risk of CNS involvement and will receive intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine . All patients should receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during chemotherapy . Particularly in patients in whom the HIV infection is well controlled, however, rituximab is generally considered to be important . The International Prognostic Index applies to HIV-associated lymphomas; in addition, a low CD4 count confers a poorer prognosis . Treatment of relapsed HIV-associated lymphomas is difficult . These patients frequently do not tolerate high-dose therapy well and its use may therefore be confined to those with better-controlled HIV disease . 
As more digital tools are deployed in health research and care settings, new questions emerge about how to use them responsibly and ethically . The development of the IRB peer review process stemmed from egregious acts whereby researchers disregarded the rights and welfare of research participants . The National Research Act was passed in 1974; it involved creating a National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research with a goal of preventing future atrocities . It was this Commission that required the formation of IRBs and also wrote the Belmont Report . Published in 1979, the Belmont Report describes three guiding principles of ethical biomedical and behavioral research: respect for persons, beneficence and justice . Published in 2012, this Report adapted the ethical principles of the Belmont Report to ICT research and added a fourth principle - that of respect for the law and public interest, which focuses on transparence of potential conflicting interests and accountability of stakeholders . Informed by guiding ethical principles, a federal policy for the protection of human subjects was published in 1991 and adopted by 15 federal agencies and institutes . The regulations speak to basic protections for human research participants in subpart A, known as the Common Rule . Additional subparts speak to protections for vulnerable populations, including children and prisoners . Core principles . Here, we describe the ethical principles and how the regulations and Common Rule are implemented in practice . Respect for persons is demonstrated through the informed consent process, which occurs when a person is given the information needed to make a sound decision about whether to volunteer to willingly participate . In the latter, a person will not be able to access the app if they do not accept the ToS nor will they receive medical care if they do not sign the medical consent form . There can be no coercive actions (exempli gratia high incentive payments, free services) that may compromise an individual's ability to volunteer . Technological literacy is another important consideration . Likewise, concerns about privacy are often raised when discussing the passive and ubiquitous nature of the tools used in digital medicine . Attitudes and preferences also vary across generations, with older adults preferring more privacy control compared with teens and young adults . Moving forward, this charge will require a commitment from the medical community to provide accessible public-facing educational modules . Clarifying these concepts is important and how best to do this will require experts in instructional design who can deliver creative educational content . Beneficence is where the probability and magnitude of potential harms are weighed against the possible benefits to a participant, the people they represent and society . Determining risk of harm is a somewhat subjective process, yet worth breaking down . We need to consider potential sources of harm and try to quantify the likelihood of something going wrong as well as the consequences . For most people, these will be negligible, but for a domestic abuse survivor or undocumented migrant, the consequences might be severe . Thus, the same potential harm presents a low risk for most, but a high risk for some important groups . Other factors specific to risk assessment include the type of potential harm (exempli gratia physical, psychological, economic, social) as well as the duration and severity of harm to research participants . Research is inherently risky because we are learning something that is not yet known . Research participants are often told about risks as an odds ratio . There is a 1 in 12 000 chance that a healthy individual doing this study will have a cardiac event that may lead to death . Because of this particular risk of harm, the research team can mitigate risk by having access to personnel and equipment used to treat a cardiac event . Having this information, an individual can decide whether they want to take that chance or not . Validity and reliability . Within the domain of beneficence is the need for the digital measurement tools to be valid and reliable (see chapter 9) . There is no potential benefit of knowledge gain if the study is poorly designed and the tools are not trustworthy . The principle of justice focuses on the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of research and recruitment protocols that are inclusive of those most likely to benefit from knowledge gained . With digital tools, we have the opportunity to reach a more diverse audience, including those in communities where health disparities are most prevalent . The participants were given the sensor and shown how to use it . One week later, the researcher returned to gather the measurement tools and found that no data had been collected . Turns out a wrist-worn mobile technology was culturally unacceptable and drew unwanted attention to the women, so they did not wear it . 
Use of the term depression to describe low mood and a 'depression of the spirits' gradually entered usage from the 18th century . On the other hand, our understanding of the physiological changes and genetic markers associated with depression is rapidly advancing, with increasingly sophisticated research techniques providing a clearer picture of brain function abnormalities associated with depression and the ways that gene-environment interactions may give rise to this disorder . The impact of depression . There is evidence that maternal depression can have a negative effect on children - who may show deficits in social, cognitive and psychological functioning, and appear to have heightened vulnerability for depression and other mental health problems in later life . Depression combined with long-term illness also causes greater disability, more extensive loss of productivity and greater increases in healthcare costs, and it is associated with more treatment complications and increased mortality . The risk of suicide for individuals with a history of depression is more than double that for the general population (see Chapter 8) . Around 60% of people who commit suicide have had depression, and younger people who kill themselves often have an alcohol or substance misuse disorder in addition to being depressed . Changes in prevalence . A number of studies identified increases in the prevalence of depression during the 20th century, and commentators have been prompted to talk of a 'depression epidemic' afflicting industrialized societies . What is not clear is whether there has been a true increase in prevalence, whether we have become better at diagnosing depression by using structured diagnostic interviews, or whether the threshold for diagnosing clinically significant depression has become lower . Study findings concerning increased rates of depression are equivocal - although increases have often been identified by comparing cross-sectional studies, increases are generally not seen in longitudinal studies of depression prevalence within well-defined populations . While there is some evidence for onset at younger ages and possible increases in incidence of depression overall, it seems that the extent of any increase in prevalence may have been overstated . When studies adopt concurrent assessment rather than retrospective recall, and the findings of appropriate studies are pooled, there appears to be no evidence for increases in child or adolescent depression between the mid-1960s and mid-1990s . Several of the national studies that found increases in adolescent emotional problems during this period have indicated a leveling-off of prevalence since 2000 . For adult depression, reviews consistently indicate an increase in rates between 1960 and 1975, with mixed findings over subsequent years . public health campaigns to improve the understanding of depression . improved identification of depression in primary care . the growth of talking treatments for psychological problems . concerns about increases in suicide rates - particularly among younger people in industrialized countries in the 1980s and 1990s . Challenges for assessment and management . Overmedicalizing depression . There are valid concerns that the breadth of severity encompassed by current diagnostic symptoms may lead to overdiagnosis of depression . Even though depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, many people need, but do not receive, treatment . In general, people with depression and other mental health problems face stereotyped views and discrimination . There is good evidence that depression is often not recognized by clinicians and that even when it is identified, it is frequently inadequately managed by health services in the USA, UK and other countries . At a fundamental level, important questions and uncertainties remain about the best way to understand and classify depression . Depression that does not meet the full criteria for a formal diagnosis is increasingly recognized to cause considerable suffering and places a significant burden on the healthcare system; it is also related to increased mortality and is a risk factor for future major depression . Developing useful approaches to understand and assist people who experience depressive symptoms across the spectrum of presentations remains a central goal . Understanding the biology of depression . Knowledge about depression and its management has developed significantly since the latter half of the 20th century . The discovery of the MAOIs and TCAs revolutionized the treatment of depression, enabling hitherto chronically depressed individuals to return to normal levels of functioning . Consequently, depression was conceptualized as arising from the dysfunction of synaptic transmission of the catecholamines . Concurrently, psychotherapy has become increasingly refined, targeting and correcting the specific problems associated with depression - a negative thinking style or interpersonal difficulties . While there has been considerable growth in our knowledge of the causes, course and management of depression, gaps in our understanding remain . Although the overwhelming majority of patients with depression are managed within primary care, much of the evidence and resulting clinical guidance is derived from studies in the secondary and tertiary sectors . Better treatments . Treatment delivery problems . 
Sometimes the data through the p -value can be misleading . The two possible mistakes are the false positive and the false negative . The false positive occurs when the null hypothesis is true (id est there is no treatment difference) but the data give a significant p -value and a treatment difference is falsely declared . The false negative occurs when the alternative hypothesis is true (id est there is a treatment difference) but the data give a non-significant p -value and the difference between treatments is not detected . The false negative is referred to as the type II error . Data from the clinical trial comparing those means will provide either a significant difference or a non-significant difference . If the data provide a non-significant p -value, the null hypothesis will not be rejected - the correct conclusion . This is the false positive, the type I error (alpha [alpha] error) . If the data provide a significant p -value, the correct conclusion can be drawn, confirming a treatment difference . Again, though, this will not always occur and from time to time a non-significant p -value will indicate no treatment difference (top right box) . This is the false negative, the type II error (beta [beta] error) . Controlling type I and II errors . By reducing the potential for one of these errors, the potential for the other error increases . Controlling the type I error . The probability of the type I error (false positive) is controlled generally at 5%, as determined by the level at which differences are declared statistically significant . Controlling the type II error . The type II error is more difficult to control . The potential for that false negative is controlled through a related quantity called power . Power = 100% − type II error . As examples, if the probability of the type II error is 10% then the power is 90%; if the trial is powered at 80%, then the probability of a type II error is 20% . The type II error is missing a true difference while the power is capturing a true difference; if there is a 10% chance of missing the bus, there is a 90% chance of catching the bus! . They are less concerned with the false negative, the type II error . The type II error is more the sponsor's problem - a sponsor does not want to fail to demonstrate a treatment difference when, in truth, there is a treatment benefit for the experimental treatment . Regulators recommend that later-phase trials have at least 80% power . Calculating sample size . Table 3.1 shows the calculated power for a range of values for the true treatment difference . From these data, if the true treatment difference is 0.50 mmol/L, the trial has a power of 62.3% (see Table 3.1) . The only way to increase the power is to increase the sample size . Table 3.2 provides the values for power at the same specified levels of effect as in Table 3.1 after doubling the sample size to 100 patients per treatment group . All the values for power have increased . In particular, the power has increased from 62.3% to 89.5% at a treatment difference of 0.50 mmol/L . A sample size of 102 patients per treatment group would give the trial 90% power, while a sample size of 76 per treatment group would give the trial 80% power . This is the basis of sample size calculation . A level of effect of interest is specified and the sample size required to give, say, 90% power is then calculated . the response rate expected in the control group - usually based on data from the literature . the targeted difference between the two means . the median OS anticipated in the control group . the treatment difference to be targeted, expressed as either an HR or an increase in the median OS . Missing data . The study from which the control group's response rate is being estimated should also have used NRI for any missing data . Event-driven trials . For example, a trial in which 100 out of 1000 patients experienced the event has the same power as a trial in which 100 out of 300 patients had the event . Calculating the sample size for a trial based on a time-to-event endpoint has an intermediate step as a consequence . First, calculate how many patients with events are needed for the required power . Sample size re-evaluation . 
History of genetic therapy . Genetic effects may be the consequence of a single gene (monogenic effect), a small number of genes (oligogenic effects) or numerous genes (polygenic effects) . A frequent corollary follows that any mutations in the genetic code may result in dysfunctional proteins, resulting in a disease state . Although 5000-8000 monogenic diseases have been classified so far, treatments for such diseases have been palliative, without addressing the root cause of the disease . Defining gene therapy . This transfer of genetic information, which may be transient or permanent, produces gene products for intercellular, intracellular or systemic uses that may affect endogenous genes, compensate for pathogenic genes or augment defective genes . Modern gene therapy and regulatory milestones . The gradual refinement of gene therapy techniques was a hallmark of the new millennium . Efforts by various research teams in the first two decades of the 2000s demonstrated the potential of gene therapy to ameliorate symptoms in various disease cases . The second decade of the millennium saw the approval of several gene therapy products and clinical trials by national regulatory agencies . Strimvelis, a gene therapy strategy for ADA-SCID, was approved by the EMA in 2016 . Disease candidates for gene therapy . Progress in different fields of molecular medicine has allowed the modern investigator to propose therapeutic strategies for various genetic diseases . Besides the aforementioned disease candidates, other key diseases that may be amenable to gene therapy are described in the following paragraphs . While monogenic, the disease is known to be caused by over 1990 mutations in the CTFR gene . Multiple mutations in the HBB gene have been linked to both diseases . Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) are T cells that have been genetically modified to express an artificial T-cell receptor . Another genetic therapy approach for targeting cancer cells involves using competent and specific viruses to attack tumor cells, but not healthy cells, lysing the tumor cells as part of the viral life cycle . Steps for development of gene therapy . Gene therapy faces numerous challenges in clinical translation . characterizing the gene of interest . translocating the gene from the vector system to the nucleus of the cell (and, if necessary, integrating the genetic cargo) . expressing the gene cargo . Analysis of the gene, gene product and related biological pathways . To assess the suitability of gene therapy for a particular disease or condition, the preclinical scientist needs to analyze various component factors . The primary factor involves determining the sequence of the gene in question and the various mutations that can affect it . This is followed by the biological characterization of the disease pathway, across the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic spectrum, to determine the expression levels of the gene of interest and any associated genes in individuals with and without the disease or condition . Quantitative assays to measure expression of the gene or levels of the gene product are also needed . Strategies for correcting the pathogenic gene . The second factor is disease dependent and revolves around the selection of a gene therapy strategy . Clinical gene therapy can be classified based on the mechanism by which the therapeutic agent ameliorates disease symptoms . Gene augmentation involves introducing a new gene to combat disease or to replace a mutated gene with a healthy copy . The delivery of genetic material (achieved by packaging the gene of interest in a vector) results in the transcription and translation of a desired gene product . Early gene therapy trials involved the transduction of immune cells or hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo, followed by reintroduction of modified cells to effect a biological response . More modern trials have investigated the effect of in vivo gene therapy . While gene augmentation may have therapeutic benefits for loss-of-function mutations, this approach is not readily applicable to . diseases resulting from improper regulation of the gene product (for example, cancer, cohesinopathies and diabetes) . Gene silencing reduces the expression of, or 'knocks down', a malfunctioning gene . Gene silencing can be used in gain-of-function diseases to inhibit the functioning of a mutated protein and so ameliorate disease symptoms . Such techniques enable in situ modification of the genetic code to permanently correct the disease mutation . Subsequent to the characterization of the disease in model systems and the selection and development of a gene therapy strategy, the next objective involves delivering the gene therapy agent to the affected tissue . 
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterized by intravascular activation of coagulation and deposition of fibrin within the microvasculature . In acute DIC, the consumption of clotting factors and platelets in the diffusely distributed thrombi may lead to a hemorrhagic diathesis and clinical bleeding . The paradoxical combination of bleeding and thrombosis in a hypotensive patient with sepsis, cancer or obstetric accident should raise suspicion of the syndrome, which is confirmed by examination of the blood film and coagulation studies . Some causes of DIC are listed in Table 12.1 . Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation . Acute DIC may also appear in patients experiencing hypotension or shock for any reason; for example, during a difficult surgical procedure, massive stroke or heart attack . Chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation . The survival of these patients is worse than that of cancer patients without DIC . Bleeding is characteristic of acute DIC, and is often a persistent oozing from wounds or incisions . For example, the sudden appearance of wound bleeding in a patient receiving an intraoperative blood transfusion may suggest an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction and DIC . In patients with obstetric DIC, persistent uterine hemorrhage is often observed . On occasion, acute DIC that initially presents with bleeding evolves into chronic DIC in which thrombosis predominates . The consequence of this extensive exposure to tissue factor is a profound activation of coagulation and the generation of large amounts of thrombin (see Chapter 1) . Thrombin promotes platelet activation and the platelet aggregates occlude the microvasculature . The consumption of platelets accounts for the thrombocytopenia that is typical of DIC . Thrombin becomes bound to antithrombin and thrombomodulin, and these proteins are soon consumed . Following binding to thrombomodulin, thrombin activates the anticoagulant protein C, which also becomes depleted, predisposing to microvascular thrombosis . Platelet levels, however, usually remain low . Recommended clinical criteria for diagnosing DIC are . A scoring system for the diagnosis of overt DIC has been developed by the DIC Subcommittee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), and is shown in Table 12.2; there is a second scoring system for non-overt DIC that includes measurements of antithrombin and protein C, as well as molecular markers of coagulation activation . Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation . The treatment of acute DIC is primarily directed toward the underlying cause . Patients with acute DIC may have profound bleeding, usually because of hypofibrinogenemia . Table 12.3 lists agents used for the management of bleeding in such patients . Fibrinogen levels may be increased by administering cryoprecipitate . Alternatively, fibrinogen concentrate provides hemostatic levels . Administering platelets should elevate the count and help stem bleeding . DIC results from activation of coagulation so there has been considerable interest in examining whether anticoagulants might be beneficial . Initial experience with heparin in patients with acute DIC was disastrous; bleeding was accentuated and mortality increased . Antithrombin concentrate, 30 000 IU over 4 days, decreased mortality in septic patients with DIC compared with placebo (22.2% vs 40%, p < 0.01) . However, there was a trend toward increased bleeding (7.0% vs 5.2%, p = 0.6) . This analysis was performed retrospectively in a subgroup of patients not receiving heparin, so further experience with this approach is needed . Chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation . Another approach to controlling chronic DIC is through the use of thrombomodulin, a protein that activates protein C and binds and inactivates thrombin . showed that a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (ART-123) improved DIC and alleviated bleeding symptoms in patients with hematologic malignancies or infection . It has been approved in Japan for the treatment of DIC; further trials in Western populations are anticipated . 
In 2010, there were 2864 deaths from breast cancer (2840 women and 24 men) . Classic epidemiological studies repeated worldwide have established risk-modifying associations with breast cancer (Table 1.1) . These associations have been bolstered by tissue and animal studies . Age is by far the greatest risk factor for breast cancer in women . The incidence of breast cancer increases with age; approximately 50% of breast cancers occur in women aged 50-64 years, and a further 30% occur in women over the age of 70 years . This illustrates the importance of environmental risk factors, as women from low-risk countries such as Japan who emigrate to higher-risk countries ultimately develop the higher risk associated with their new country . There is clear evidence that regular drinking also increases the risk of recurrence, as well as contralateral breast cancer, in breast cancer survivors . Although studies have indeed found an association, the effect of smoking on breast cancer risk is not as strong as its effect on the risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases or other cancers . Weight reduction is also associated with a reduced risk . Women who work night shifts appear to have an increased risk of developing breast cancer . There is increasing and compelling evidence that mammographic breast density correlates directly with the risk of breast cancer, with a relative risk of up to 4 between the most and least dense breasts . BRCA2 is functionally related, but distinct . Moreover, changes in BRCA2 do not appear to be restricted to breast cancer . One of the genes closely associated with Fanconi anemia appears to be identical to BRCA2 . Other genes associated with breast cancer . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are not the only genes implicated in breast cancer . One of the common DNA-sequence variants that confers a small increase in breast cancer risk is CHEK2 . Genes represent predisposition . risk of disease . relapse and survival risk . It is also examining whether any intervention that changes such methylation profiles alters the risk of developing breast cancer . The risk of breast cancer is increased two- to threefold in women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer; the risk is also increased, but to a lesser extent, in women with a second-degree relative who is affected . The risk is particularly high if . the affected relative is on the maternal side of the family . two first-degree relatives are affected . the relative has bilateral breast cancer . the relative's cancer was diagnosed before the age of 50 years . The risk of breast cancer is increased in women from higher socioeconomic classes and living in urban areas . The risk of breast cancer is increased in women who begin to menstruate at an early age (< 12 years) or who undergo the menopause at a relatively advanced age (> 55 years) . Age at first full-term pregnancy appears to be the most important factor influencing hormonal status and thereby reducing the risk of breast cancer . Furthermore, multiparous postmenopausal women have a lower risk of breast cancer than nulliparous women . Pregnancy-associated hypertension may be associated with reduced risk and diethylstilbestrol exposure of the mother with increased risk . However, a large meta-analysis of 53 studies and 83 000 women in 16 countries found no increased risk of breast cancer in women who had had an abortion, largely refuting this hypothesis . Obesity confers an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women . High consumption of animal fats has also been linked to breast cancer . However, a meta-analysis of cohort studies involving over 330 000 women found no evidence for an association between the relative risk of breast cancer and dietary fat intake . Oral contraceptives . A meta-analysis involving over 150 000 women examined the influence of oral contraceptive use on the risk of breast cancer . The relative risk was slightly increased (1.24) in women who had used oral contraceptives within 10 years, but no excess risk was seen in those who had used oral contraceptives more than 10 years previously . The risk is particularly high when oral contraceptives are taken before the first full-term pregnancy . The slight increase in risk associated with oral contraceptives should, however, be viewed in the context of women's health in general . There is no evidence to indicate how current formulations of oral contraceptives affect breast cancer risk . Several large observational studies have clearly shown that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of developing breast cancer . 
Prodromal Parkinson's disease . The Parkinson's journey may begin long before diagnosis, as Parkinson's disease is now recognized to have a prodromal period dominated by a number of non-motor symptoms . Those who have the non-motor prodrome will have had unexplained symptoms for years, while those with a dominant motor presentation may have had symptoms for only a few months . While the cardinal motor symptoms and signs of rest tremor, akinesia and rigidity remain the mainstay of diagnosis, the prodrome of non-motor symptoms described above develops in the majority of patients . At least half of all patients experience mood disturbance with anxiety or depression at some stage of the illness, including in the prodromal phase . Delivering the diagnosis . Care must be taken in how the diagnosis is delivered . It is best to break the news of a patient's diagnosis in the presence of their spouse, partner or other family members . Satisfaction with the initial explanation of the diagnosis has been shown to continue to have an independent effect on quality of life even much later in the illness . The disease is only slowly progressive . There are many effective symptomatic therapies that can help maintain quality of life for the majority of the illness . Regardless of the stage of the disease, non-motor symptoms, in particular depression or mood disturbance, dominate as the predictor of quality of life . It is useful to guide the patient to a viewpoint whereby the focus is maintaining quality of life, rather than defining themselves by their Parkinson's disease, and it is therefore important to address both non-motor and motor symptoms, and to treat both social and motor disability . Early-stage stable Parkinson's disease . Many patients who have already been diagnosed will have read on the internet, or will even have been told by another clinician, that treatment is only effective for 5 years . It is important to recognize the patient who has this misconception in order to unequivocally dispel it . Patients who may not have fully accepted the diagnosis may be fearful of treatment . It is important to acknowledge this, and to help the patient deal with their fear and denial . In early Parkinson's disease, motor and non-motor symptoms can be controlled in a stable fashion with relatively simple medication regimens . Initial therapy . There is also increasing evidence for the benefits of exercise or physical therapy, even in early or mild Parkinson's disease . Mid-stage unstable Parkinson's disease . In most patients, the early stable period of disease eventually develops into an unstable mid stage, which remains poorly defined . Patients experience some balance issues, fear of falling, early morning off periods and dyskinesias . Patients can experience a return of any of their motor symptoms (tremor, slowness or stiffness) . Around the same time, although not necessarily linked, many patients experience involuntary movements in response to their dopaminergic therapy (dyskinesias) . The multidisciplinary team has a crucial role during this period to reassure the patient and carer, re-evaluate motor and non-motor symptoms and ensure that appropriate appointments for physiotherapy and speech and language therapy are made . For some patients, assessment of their ability to drive and/or to continue working in a stressful job etc . also needs to be considered at this stage . Although patients can still improve with adjustments to their oral medications, this usually only offers limited control . Advanced therapy . Advanced Parkinson's disease . Mid-stage Parkinson's disease leads on to an advanced stage of disease associated with a range of motor and non-motor functional consequences . In some patients, the final stages of Parkinson's disease may involve the development and delivery of palliative care . Patients should be reassured that regardless of when their Parkinson's disease developed (fifth, sixth or seventh decade), these complications do not tend to occur until patients enter their eighth or ninth decade, so not all patients will reach this stage of Parkinson's disease . Treatment of this stage of the disease remains the greatest challenge in the modern era . It is important that people with Parkinson's disease continue to experience care from a specialist, who can best help navigate the route between over- and under-treatment . Patient education . Patients should be encouraged to learn about their condition . Patient support groups can help with this (see Useful resources, pages 161 -) . Gentle but accurate explanation of what is happening is important so that both patients and carers maintain some sense of control . 
The pathological features of chronic pancreatitis are . Several theories explain the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis, although none is perfect . Additional factors that contribute to the development of chronic pancreatitis, and an individual's susceptibility to it, include genetic factors (see Chapter 10) . About 50% of patients develop pancreatic exocrine and endocrine deficiency some 20 years after disease onset, and about 80% experience pain . Features include . Pancreatic endocrine failure . Features include . Causes of pain . The pain of chronic pancreatitis is multifactorial in origin, but modern theories principally relate to nerve alterations (Figure 9.2) . The number and diameter of intra- and interlobular nerve bundles in pancreatic tissue is increased . Expression of nerve growth factor and tyrosine kinase receptor A is increased and has a significant relationship with pain intensity . Pain may be increased as a consequence of local complications such as pseudocysts and biliary tract or duodenal obstruction . Pain is also associated with the inability to digest fat properly (malabsorption) . Older theories include increased intraductal pressure and compartment syndrome . Blood tests . A pancreatic pseudocyst should be differentiated from a pancreatic cystic tumor . Positron emission tomography may not reliably distinguish chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer . Fat intake should not be restricted but the patient must take sufficient pancreatic enzyme supplementation with each meal . Other medical treatments include . Patients with intermittent pain appear to have a more favorable disease course . The American Gastroenterological Association has produced guidelines for the management of pain, which can be quite problematic (Figure 9.8) . Endoscopic treatment . There may be little effect on pain and the techniques do not influence the development of pancreatic insufficiency . Choice between endoscopic and surgical drainage relies on patient comorbidities and compliance with repeat endoscopic procedures . Drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts . The long-term recurrence rate is about 10% . Relatively simple pseudocysts without parenchymal disease are most suitable for endoscopic treatment . Celiac plexus block under EUS guidance or percutaneous routes may be undertaken in some patients, but generally one should not expect long-term pain relief . Limited data comparing the two techniques suggest the EUS-guided route may be more effective . This procedure provides good short-term pain relief in about 50% of patients - particularly those with no prior intervention - but the benefit is greatly reduced in the long term . Pain relief is moderate to good in 80% of patients in the short-term, but only 50-60% of patients are pain free at 5 years . There is little effect on pain in patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis . Drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts . The indications for surgical internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts include . Biliary stricture occurs in 6% of patients and duodenal obstruction in 1% . Pancreatic resection achieves the best results for intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis . Long-term pain relief is achieved in 70-95% of patients, but there is a still a mortality of 1-3% . The outcome is better if patients have not been long-term heavy users of opioid analgesia . Complications of chronic pancreatitis include . abdominal pain (intermittent or continuous - with increased pain during exacerbations); typically the pain is in the epigastrium and the back, and is relieved by flexion . abdominal mass - mass-forming pancreatitis, pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis, pseudocysts or pancreatic cancer . vomiting due to duodenal obstruction . abdominal distension due to pancreatic ascites . Many patients lose the support of their friends and family or their employment, especially if the pancreatitis is associated with alcohol consumption . Patients should lead a healthy lifestyle (low-fat diet, no alcohol and no smoking) . Genetic counseling and intervention in patients with hereditary and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis . Drugs that will modify the progression of the disease . Effective secondary screening for pancreatic cancer . More effective pain control measures . Further refinement of endoscopic and surgical techniques . 
The likely causes of bladder outlet obstruction are listed in Table 5.1 . The patient may present with a variety of storage and voiding symptoms . The cause of BPH is not fully understood . The hormonal theory postulates that estrogen-androgen synergism associated with aging drives prostatic growth . One in every 5000-8000 boys is born with posterior urethral valves . Strictures may be caused by inflammation or scarring as a result of surgery, disease or injury . The risk is increased in patients with sexually transmitted diseases, repeated episodes of urethritis or BPH . Instrumentation of the urethra (with a catheter or cystoscope) also increases the risk . Congenital strictures and true strictures occur rarely in women . It is characterized by incomplete opening of the bladder neck during voluntary or involuntary voiding . These men typically have normal-sized prostate glands, and objective evidence of obstruction is easily obtained on urodynamic examination . Once obstruction is diagnosed, it may be located to the bladder neck by videourodynamic investigation . Symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction vary . Examination and investigations . A thorough abdominal and pelvic examination should be carried out to evaluate the following . bladder distension . abdominal mass . POP, particularly cystocele, and vaginal vault in women . In addition, urinalysis should be performed to detect hematuria (see Chapter 6) and signs of infection, and serum creatinine should be measured . Some men with BPH will have some degree of renal impairment . It is important to investigate this, as it affects clinical management . For example, a man with BPH and renal impairment may require more urgent surgical intervention and will need to be monitored more closely during and after surgery . There is some debate about whether the measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be mandatory . Ideally, the advantages and disadvantages of such testing should be explained to the patient . Uroflowmetry and urodynamic investigation . Measurement of urinary flow rate is an extremely useful investigation in patients with voiding dysfunction . The reduced flow rate characteristic of prostatic outlet obstruction is shown in Figure 2.4 . Urodynamically, outlet obstruction is generally defined as high detrusor pressure accompanied by low urine flow rate . Once obstruction has been diagnosed, videourodynamic investigation can be useful to determine the site of the obstruction . Videourodynamic studies, with reduction of the POP, are helpful in women . Transrectal ultrasonography can be helpful if an accurate prostate size estimate is desired and when clinical findings or PSA levels suggest the presence of prostate cancer . It is also used to guide prostatic biopsy . Bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic obstruction . The aim of treatment is to relieve the obstruction by reducing the smooth muscle tone or bulk of the prostate . Initial therapy for bothersome symptoms includes medications (Table 5.3) . They act by relaxing the prostate and bladder neck smooth muscle, reducing outlet obstruction without adversely affecting detrusor contractility . Side effects include ejaculation issues, floppy iris syndrome, dizziness, rhinitis, headache and postural hypotension . alpha -reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which plays a key role in the development of BPH . Side effects include erectile dysfunction, libido loss and ejaculatory disturbances . The prostate is resected with a diathermy loop in a resectoscope inserted via the urethra . It is almost as effective as transurethral resection but with lower complication rates, although the likelihood that further treatment may become necessary is higher . Laser ablation of the prostate is an alternative to transurethral resection . It involves vaporization of the enlarged prostate with a neodynium, yttrium or holmium laser . Open prostatectomy is indicated only in men who have extremely large prostates . Primary bladder neck obstruction . Urethral stricture Treatment is initially by urethral dilatation or urethrotomy, although complex or recurrent cases may require urethroplasty . Voiding problems . Voiding (emptying) problems occur when there is an impediment to the normal smooth emptying of the bladder . 
A specific approach to the management of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) may be required in certain patient populations, such as women and children, and in particular situations, such as splanchnic vein thrombosis or surgery . MPNs in women: influence of sex on phenotype . Epidemiology studies suggest that the outcome of MPNs differs between men and women . Other studies have reported higher rates of splanchnic vein thrombosis (see below) and cerebral vascular thrombosis in women than in men . Importantly, MPNs affect women at any stage of life and hence present specific challenges with respect to contraception, pregnancy and the menopause . Combined oral contraceptives are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, and are not recommended for women with any MPN . Table 8.1 presents the potential complications of pregnancy in women with MPNs . In a review of outcomes data from 564 pregnancies in women with essential thrombocythemia (ET) (the most common MPN in women of reproductive age), first-trimester loss occurred in 26% and late-pregnancy loss in 11% . The most common maternal complication was pre-eclampsia, which occurred in 3.4% of women . Similar findings have been reported in women with PV, while a study of eight women with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) reported a live birth rate of 50% . Potential risk factors for thrombosis and other adverse outcomes in pregnancy are listed in Table 8.2 . While there are no validated predictors of outcome in pregnancy, previous thrombosis or hemorrhage and extreme thrombocytosis are considered to be risk factors for adverse outcomes in women with MPN . It is not clear whether the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation predicts adverse pregnancy outcome . An algorithm for the management of pregnancy in women with MPNs is shown in Figure 8.1 . There are few data on the safety of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women with MPN . Although estrogens are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, one retrospective study found that the use of estrogen-based HRT was not associated with an increased risk of major thrombotic events in women with MPN . MPNs in children . MPNs are extremely rare in children, although diagnosis rates are increasing with the availability of rapid tests for JAK2 V617F and other driver mutations . Treatment recommendations are largely based on trials in adults . There is currently no risk stratification system for children with MPNs because of a lack of long-term data . However, the consensus is that a child with a history of life-threatening venous or arterial thrombosis is at high risk, and cytoreductive therapy is warranted . Cytoreductive therapy should be used only as a last resort in high-risk patients . Few cases of PMF have been reported in children . Splanchnic vein thrombosis . Splanchnic vein thrombosis (also known as abdominal vein thrombosis) is common in MPNs, occurring in approximately 15% of patients, and may include . mesenteric or splenic vein thrombosis . The clinical presentation of these conditions varies . The symptoms of acute mesenteric vein thrombosis resemble those of acute portal vein thrombosis, although chronic thrombosis may be asymptomatic . In fact, splanchnic vein thrombosis may be the first clinical sign of MPN . In a 2012 meta-analysis, MPN was present in approximately 41% of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome and 32% of those with portal vein thrombosis . Treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis requires a multidisciplinary approach including hematologists, gastroenterologists or hepatologists, thrombosis experts, interventional radiologists and surgeons . Given the risks of thrombosis and bleeding associated with MPN, patients undergoing surgery require careful management; however, data to inform treatment decisions in this setting are limited . Similarly, retrospective studies indicate that surgery is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients with PV (Figure 8.2), but prospective data are lacking . The following recommendations have been made for the management of surgical patients with PV and can be generalized to other MPNs . 
Prognostication requires evaluation of the following . pre-treatment risk based on . cytogenetic and molecular analysis . post-treatment parameters: measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring . Multiple studies have established age as an important and independent adverse risk factor; in particular, older patients (> 60 years) have dismal outcomes with conventional treatment . Table 5.1 summarizes data from a retrospective analysis of the combined adverse effects of older age and poor performance status on mortality risk . This and other studies have also identified a positive correlation between increasing age and adverse cytogenetic and molecular markers, and with increased incidence of multidrug resistance to chemotherapy . Performance status and comorbidities should also be considered alongside age when deciding on the intensity of treatment to offer older patients with AML . For example, conventional anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy would not be suitable for a patient with a history of ischemic or congestive heart disease . Patients may also develop consequences of AML that influence the treatment strategy, such as severe sepsis . Cytogenetic and molecular signatures . Cytogenetics and the molecular signature have become the cornerstone of risk stratification in AML . Prognostic assignment differs slightly among North American and European groups but the basic premise is shared . Additional parameters such as age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, presence of certain gene mutations and response to induction chemotherapy can influence prognosis, while the type of consolidation therapy could potentially alter the predicted outcomes, as discussed in Chapter 4 . The last decade has seen an explosion in our understanding of the molecular genetics of AML, and the recognition that several of these abnormalities (not previously recognized on a conventional karyotype), either alone or in combination, have a significant bearing on prognosis . The numerous genetic abnormalities seen in AML are summarized in the recent European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines . The ELN has recently revised the risk stratification groups for AML on the basis of the genetic abnormalities detected by conventional karyotyping and molecular techniques (see Table 2.4) . Many of these mutations are context specific in both their occurrence and impact on clinical outcomes . For example . ASXL-1 mutations occur more commonly in older patients and are also associated with poor prognosis . In the large cohort of patient with cytogenetically normal karyotype, mutation analysis in NPM1 and FLT3 can help distinguish three subsets . NPM1+ / FLT3 -ITD+ is associated with intermediate risk . The impact of these combinations on event-free and overall survival has been shown by a retrospective analysis of two consecutive AML Study Group trials, as illustrated in Figure 5.1 . With the increasing use of high-throughput molecular analysis, clinicians can look forward to the identification of well-defined biologic entities to enhance prognostication in AML . The identification of novel markers beyond prognostication may also help identify subsets of patients who may benefit from therapies with specific molecular targets . This is best illustrated by the recent success demonstrated with the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin, described on page 36 . Similar targeted therapies are being evaluated for IDH1, IDH2 and KMT2A mutations, as discussed in Chapter 6 . Measurable residual disease monitoring . Patients who do not achieve CR after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy are considered to be at high risk for relapse . The presence of MRD after completion of induction and consolidation chemotherapy despite morphological remission has significant prognostic implication . MRD can be measured using multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC; successful in > 90% of cases) or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays where a molecular lesion has been identified . MFC requires substantial technical expertise, and interpretation is partially subjective so it has been difficult to establish inter-laboratory standardization . Despite these challenges, several studies have established the role of MRD in the accurate prognosis of outcomes when performed after induction and consolidation therapy and before alloHCT . MRD monitoring is uniquely beneficial for high-risk APL patients in CR1 . Detection of rising MRD has been shown to accurately predict relapse . Studies are currently investigating whether intervention based on such information can improve clinical outcomes in AML . Currently, NGS is investigational for diagnosis, MRD detection and sequential MRD monitoring and is not yet a component of standard of care . 
The use of ultrasonography in the investigation of abdominal symptoms and abnormal liver function tests has greatly increased the detection of benign liver lesions (Table 9.1), although the lesions identified are often not relevant to the issue under investigation . Because the detection of focal lesions in the liver can precipitate considerable anxiety until they are characterized as benign, appropriate investigations are warranted and occasionally therapeutic intervention is indicated . The typical investigation pathway after the initial detection is by computed tomography (CT) or MRI . The key questions to be answered about the lesion are . The characteristics of the more common benign lesions are summarized in Table 9.2 . Lesions that are difficult to classify after radiological evaluation may be further evaluated by biopsy or reassessed radiologically after an interval of 3-6 months . Lesions are considered to be benign if the dimensions and characteristics of the lesion(s) remain constant during that period . It is not uncommon for individuals to have a combination of benign lesions . Benign liver tumors . Hemangiomas are the most common of all the benign focal lesions and are present in at least 1% of the population . Hemangiomas are most commonly found near the capsule of the right lobe . Classic lesions can be diagnosed with a high degree of confidence with any of the radiological techniques, but occasionally complex lesions require extensive investigation . Focal nodular hyperplasia is the most frequent of the benign solid liver tumors and is most commonly encountered in women during their reproductive years . The typical lesion is solitary, measures 3-5 cm in diameter and has a characteristic central scar that may be visualized on scanning . Unlike adenomas, there is no risk of rupture or malignant transformation and these lesions do not need specific therapy . Adenomas are rare - about 300 are diagnosed annually in the USA - but are the most clinically relevant of the benign tumors . Unlike focal nodular hyperplasia, these lesions have the potential to grow, hemorrhage and rupture . The last two complications may present with severe abdominal pain . Surgical resection is recommended if an adenoma exceeds 10 cm in diameter; however, this is not an option when the lesions are multiple and distributed throughout both lobes of the liver, a condition referred to as adenomatosis . Simple cysts are common and are found in 2.5% of the population . Most are asymptomatic unless very large or complicated by infection or hemorrhage into the cyst . The appearance on ultrasonography is characteristic as a well-defined echo-free lesion with posterior acoustic enhancement (Figure 9.2) . Polycystic liver disease may occur in isolation or in association with polycystic kidney disease . Some cases are associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis . These cysts can also be complicated by hemorrhage and infection . Pain or jaundice are the most common presenting symptoms, typically in young adults . Surgical resection may be required . Infections and abscesses . Pyogenic liver abscesses are discrete pockets of infection within the substance of the liver tissue . There are two patterns of abscess: multiple small abscesses distributed throughout the liver, and larger discrete abscesses, which have a predilection for the right lobe . The latter are readily apparent on scanning the liver, but small abscesses may be difficult to detect . Despite effective drainage, protracted periods of antibiotic therapy are required to eradicate the infection . Antibiotics are the only effective therapy for the smaller, diffuse pattern of infection . The initial infection may be associated with a diarrheal illness . The abscess can usually be detected on ultrasonography and is most frequently found in the right lobe . Most cases respond to therapy with metronidazole or tinidazole; drainage or surgery are reserved for difficult cases . The cysts are detected on ultrasonography or CT and often have characteristic 'daughter cysts' attached to the wall of the dominant cyst . Percutaneous aspiration of the cysts is not advised . Initial management is with mebendazole or albendazole but many cases will require surgical resection . Cholangitis is infection in the biliary tree and is usually associated with an obstruction to bile flow (exempli gratia stone in the common bile duct, benign stricture or malignant disease) . 
About 6000 liver transplants are performed annually in both the USA and Europe . After transplant, most patients enjoy long-term survival and dramatic improvements in quality of life . Many patients with advanced liver disease, however, are not candidates for liver transplantation, in part due to the limited supply of donor organs . Liver transplantation may be a viable option for patients with advanced liver disease of almost any etiology . In the USA, the most common indications for transplantation resulting from chronic liver disease are viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (Table 12.1) . Severe liver disease that has resulted from acute disorders may also require liver transplantation (Table 12.2) . Timing of liver transplantation . Referral criteria for acute and chronic liver disease differ . Acute liver failure is defined as the rapid development of jaundice and encephalopathy in a patient with no history of liver disease . Acute viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury are common causes . In general, patients with acute liver disease complicated by encephalopathy should be transferred to a liver transplant center for continued observation and preparation for transplant if needed . With regard to chronic liver disease, it is best to select patients for liver transplant whose survival would otherwise be dramatically limited . It must be noted, however, that advanced liver disease itself causes systemic changes that may limit the success of liver transplantation . Thus, the clinician must select patients who are most in need of liver transplant, and are likely to survive the procedure . The Child's score (Table 12.6) predicts survival for patients with advanced cirrhosis . Patients with a score greater than 7 are likely to benefit from consultation at a liver transplant center . In interpreting the MELD score in hospitalized patients, the 3-month mortality is . TABLE 12.6 Determination of Child's score, used to predict the survival of patients with severe cirrhosis . Patient has well-maintained liver function and excellent expected survival . Reduced survival . Transplant centers use the MELD score to prioritize patients awaiting liver transplant . A similar score for pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD score) is also available . Currently, recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is almost universal and about one-third of patients get aggressive liver disease . The antiretrovirals also appear to have reduced the need for liver transplantation in these patients because of liver failure, although hepatocellular carcinoma continues to be a common indication . Transplantation for patients with ALD remains controversial . Survival of patients with ALD following transplantation appears to be comparable to that of transplant patients with non-alcoholic liver disease . Most transplant centers require at least 6 months' abstinence before consideration for liver transplantation . Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) . Long-term management of liver transplant recipients . The number of liver transplants being performed annually worldwide is in the region of 15-20 000 . Liver transplant recipients require long-term immunosuppression, although they tend to be less aggressively immunosuppressed than recipients of other solid organ transplants . immunosuppression per se . effects of individual immunosuppressive drugs . Long-term immunosuppression increases the risk of opportunistic infections and malignant disease (Table 12.7) . Vaccination against influenza is recommended for liver transplant recipients and should reduce the incidence of influenza in these patients . This is the most common non-cutaneous malignant disease after liver transplantation and can present at any time . Immunosuppressive drugs . All of the immunosuppressive drugs have potential side effects (Table 12.8) . However, some of these are sufficiently common in the context of liver transplantation (exempli gratia headache and diarrhea) that extensive investigation is unnecessary . A typical example is the nephrotoxicity associated with long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors - up to 25% of liver transplant recipients have chronic renal failure 10 years after transplantation . Disease recurrence . Many liver diseases have the potential to recur after liver transplantation (Table 12.9) . Dietary restrictions pertinent to chronic liver disease (exempli gratia salt or protein restriction) no longer apply . Dietary adjustments are needed in patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia or hypertension . 
Although diagnosis is relatively straightforward, a number of other dermatological entities may be confused with psoriasis (Table 3.1) . A careful medical and family history and physical examination, together with laboratory findings, will usually reveal the correct diagnosis . Drug-induced rashes . Drug sensitivity, including the hypersensitivity syndrome (also known as drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), may be psoriasiform in nature . Drug-induced rashes are usually characterized by a generalized skin eruption and, less frequently, fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and visceral involvement . Sulfonamides and anticonvulsants are most often implicated as causal agents . Lichen planus . The Koebner phenomenon (see page 25) is found in lichen planus, as in psoriasis . Diagnosis is usually by clinical examination supported, if necessary, by skin biopsy . Skin cancers . If localized psoriasiform lesions fail to respond to traditional topical therapy, this diagnosis should be considered and a skin biopsy performed . Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) . In its early stages, when patches or plaques are apparent, this condition may closely resemble psoriasis . However, biopsy is usually required; this may need to be repeated at intervals for confirmation . Pityriasis rosea . The onset of pityriasis rosea is typically acute, and the first sign is usually a single large herald patch presenting a few days before the characteristic truncal rash . This is normally self-limiting over a period of 8-12 weeks, producing multiple oval scaly lesions in a 'Christmas tree' distribution (Figure 3.5) . Distinction from acute guttate psoriasis may be difficult . In flexural areas, peripheral pustules are characteristic of Candida infection . The presence of yeast and pseudohyphae in Gram-stained microscopy specimens will confirm infection . Where diagnostic doubt exists, appropriate mycological specimens (skin, hair and/or nail) should be taken . Tinea capitis is ringworm of the head . Tinea corporis affects the body (Figure 3.2) . Tinea cruris affects the groin area, and is characterized by central clearing with an advancing edge . The lesion has a non-silvery, fine scale, particularly at the periphery, and frequently extends more on the left than the right side . Tinea pedis is ringworm of the feet . In the 'dry moccasin' variety of tinea pedis, a relative lack of symmetry is seen . Tinea manum is ringworm of the hands . It presents as a fine powdery scale, particularly involving the palms and palmar creases . Again, it is usually asymmetrical . Tinea unguium infection of the nails may be extremely difficult to distinguish from psoriatic nail involvement, particularly in toenails . Furthermore, patients with psoriatic nail disease are more likely than individuals without pre-existing nail disease to have an associated fungal infection . Appropriate cultures taken from the nails are often required to make the diagnosis . Secondary syphilis . The guttate (drop-like) forms of psoriasis may mimic secondary syphilis . If in doubt, serological testing for syphilis should be considered . Eczema/dermatitis . Discoid eczema . Hand and foot eczema . Taking a skin biopsy to differentiate it from psoriasis is rarely helpful . Flexural (atopic) eczema . A history of atopy, including asthma, allergies or rhinitis, will frequently exclude psoriasis . In addition, the lack of classic psoriatic nail involvement is important . Contact dermatitis is seldom symmetrical and is more pruritic than psoriasis, particularly in the early stages . Pompholyx of the palms and soles (dyshidrotic eczema) may frequently mimic pustular psoriasis of the palms and soles . However, in the initial stage, pompholyx vesicles are clear (in contrast to the yellowish color of pustular psoriasis; see Figure 2.6) and are intensely pruritic . 
Early descriptions . Descriptions of symptoms associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia date back to preclassical cultures . These were considered to be the manifestations of supernatural forces invading the individual, often as punishment for immoral behavior . In ancient Greece and Rome, the focus for studying mental illnesses moved towards a naturalistic standpoint . Early Greek physicians described delusions of grandeur, paranoia and deterioration in cognitive functions and personality . These were attributed to disturbances among the four bodily humors: blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm . In Western cultures, the Renaissance led to a re-emergence of interest in classical thought, with a reawakening of the conceptualization of mental illnesses, including psychoses, as naturalistic disorders . The first European psychiatric hospitals were established during this period . Organic etiologies of mental illness were adopted, and the initial descriptions and classifications of these disorders were attempted . Developments in classification . In the first part of the 19th century, the foundations for the modern concept of schizophrenia were established (Table 1.1) . An early diagnostic system emerged and various mental illnesses were described, including epilepsy, melancholia, mania and the dementing psychotic disorders, which included schizophrenia . However, the system lacked a general approach that could integrate the diverse manifestations of mental illness into distinct clinical syndromes . The situation was complicated by the overlap in the clinical presentation of these disorders . Furthermore, the clinical presentation of an individual could change over time, and patients with the same symptoms could have different outcomes . Two developments led to the eventual delineation of schizophrenia from the other dementing psychoses . First, the limitations of cross-sectional descriptions of symptoms for classifying mental disorders led to the emergence of a new system based on unified causes, clinicopathological correlations and the longitudinal course and prognosis of presumed disorders . The other development was the identification of the spirochete as the causal agent in general paralysis of the insane (GPI) (Figure 1.1), a common form of insanity in the 19th century . Its symptom manifestations were diverse and overlapped extensively with the symptomatology of schizophrenia . The identification of GPI as a syphilitic insanity helped Emil Kraepelin (Figure 1.2) to delineate the two other major patterns of insanity: manic-depressive psychosis and dementia praecox (or dementia of the young: schizophrenia), and to group together under the heading of dementia praecox the previously disparate categories of insanity, including hebephrenia, paranoia and catatonia . In differentiating dementia praecox from manic-depressive disorder, Kraepelin emphasized the early onset and what he believed to be the inevitable deteriorating course of dementia praecox, compared with the relatively good outcome of manic-depressive illness . Kraepelin also described what he thought were the two main pathological processes in patients with schizophrenia . The former process corresponds to our current concept of the negative symptoms, and the latter to the positive symptoms, of schizophrenia . In 1911, Eugen Bleuler (Figure 1.3), recognizing that dementia was not a necessary characteristic of dementia praecox, suggested the term 'schizophrenia' (splitting of the mind) for the disorder . Bleuler believed that schizophrenia represented a syndrome consisting of several disorders that shared a common psychopathology . He also introduced the concept of primary and secondary symptoms of schizophrenia . His four primary symptoms (the four 'A's) were abnormal associations, autistic behavior and thinking, abnormal affect and ambivalence . Of these four symptoms, Bleuler viewed as central to the illness the loss of association between thought processes and that between thought, emotion and behavior . Since Kraepelin and Bleuler there have been relatively few modifications of the description of schizophrenia . Karl Jaspers advanced the idea of precise phenomenology to describe mental symptoms accurately . The diagnostic categories of schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder were introduced in the 20th century, but these categories largely represent refinements in the boundary between schizophrenia and the affective disorders . Current views . Currently, schizophrenia has the status of a syndrome, a characteristic collection of symptoms that result from multiple genetic and environmental causal pathways . These pathways produce disorders of normal brain function that give rise to positive and negative symptoms, cognitive impairments and functional disabilities . These manifestations and their long-term course are used to differentiate schizophrenia from other forms of psychosis (see Chapter 2) . Whether schizophrenia is best viewed as a dimensional disorder, on a continuum with mood disorders, continues to be debated . 
Diagnostic tests . CT scans are especially useful for delineating bony structures and destruction, and intratumoral calcifications . Management in general . However, regular follow-up with imaging is then necessary to monitor tumor progression . It can be curative if benign skull base tumors are resected completely . Consequently, it is now possible to carry out more radical surgery, with reduced morbidity . Pituitary tumors . Improvements in neuroimaging increasingly reveal incidental, usually asymptomatic, pituitary adenomas . These occult microadenomas have been reported on as many as 10-15% of routine MRIs . Headache is the most common neurological symptom . This syndrome occurs as a result of intratumoral hemorrhage or acute necrosis with edema and compression . Additional tests or specific attempts at hormone stimulation may be important in defining specific syndromes . MRI is the procedure of choice for imaging the pituitary region (Figure 9.2) . CT may be useful to evaluate hemorrhage in the setting of pituitary apoplexy . Disorders to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a sellar mass are listed in Table 9.3 . Table 9.4 summarizes treatment for pituitary adenomas . There is a significant risk of osteoporosis as a result of hypogonadism . Other medical conditions may also cause moderate prolactinemia (Table 9.5) . Patients with microadenomas are particularly likely to respond well to medical treatment . Arthritis and glucose intolerance are other common symptoms . Surgery is the initial treatment of choice . Medical management using somatostatin analogs such as octreotide is also effective . Radiographically, these tumors are usually very small microadenomas . Resection is curative; most failures result from inability to find the tumor . Repeat surgery remains the treatment of choice for persistent Cushing disease . However, 20% of patients die of complications or distant metastases . Most are macroadenomas and should be treated surgically . Non-secreting pituitary adenomas . Small, clinically silent, incidental pituitary adenomas can be followed clinically and radiographically . The main treatment options are surgical resection and radiotherapy . The prognosis is generally poor, with a 1-year mortality in excess of 50% . About half of all craniopharyngiomas occur in children and the other half in adults . Children often present with growth failure, and adults with amenorrhea or impotence . Extreme obesity may be seen in patients with hypothalamic involvement . Surgical resection is the treatment of choice . With current microsurgical techniques, it is increasingly possible to achieve a gross total resection . Schwannomas account for 6-8% of all intracranial tumors . Symptoms relate to dysfunction of the involved cranial nerve . In most cases, schwannomas are managed surgically . The goal is to achieve total resection of tumor with preservation of cranial nerve function . Paragangliomas arise from paraganglion tissue in the head and neck . These tumors develop more commonly in women, and can arise at any age . Multiple tumors or a familial occurrence is noted in 10% of cases . Presenting symptoms include epistaxis and nasal congestion . A minority of patients have CNS symptoms . Esthesioneuroblastomas can be slow-growing tumors, but their behavior is unpredictable . Surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy appears to confer the best outcome . Esthesioneuroblastomas may recur after long disease-free intervals, necessitating prolonged follow-up . Recurrences are usually local, but regional lymph node and distant metastases are not uncommon . Chordomas and chondrosarcomas . Chordomas may show areas of high signal, representing gelatinous areas, on T1-weighted images . Typical presenting symptoms are diplopia and headache . Maximal surgical resection and younger age are associated with longer disease-free survival . Skull base tumors . Meningiomas are addressed in Chapter 6 . 
There are several theories for the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, all of which are controversial . Other theories include . The disease quickly resolves in 75% of patients, but in the other 25% the attack is severe . Unlike chronic pancreatitis, once the patient has recovered from an attack of acute pancreatitis there may be complete resolution of symptoms and a return to normal anatomy and physiology . peptic ulcer disease . Up to 10% of patients have necrosis of the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, which continues for several days, with variable evolution towards persistence or disappearance, remaining sterile or becoming infected . Predicting severity . It is important to determine as early as possible (within the first 3 days of symptom onset) whether the attack of pancreatitis is likely to be mild or severe . acute pancreatitis (includes mild acute pancreatitis; no organ failure, no local or systemic complications) . moderately severe acute pancreatitis (transient organ failure, local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure) . severe acute pancreatitis (persistent organ failure over 48 hours) . Clinical judgment can be difficult, especially during the first 24-48 hours when the severity of disease may change rapidly . Pancreatitis severity is usually stratified into mild, moderate and severe, based on the extent of inflammatory changes, fluid collections and necrosis seen in CT scans . It was modified into the CT severity index by including grading of necrosis extent . Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) above 150 mg/L indicates a severe attack, but the peak is not reached until 72 hours after symptom onset . The Ranson score includes 11 criteria variously applicable at 24 and 48 hours, and separate systems for alcohol- and gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis . The essential requirements are as follows . Overviews of the management for mild and severe attacks are given in Figures 8.3 and 8.4, respectively . Mild acute pancreatitis . Severe acute pancreatitis . Patients with a severe attack have persistent organ failure (over 48 hours from onset) and will need to be managed on an intensive care unit . Patients may also require two or more of the following . Compared to parenteral feeding, enteral feeding reduces infectious complications, surgical interventions and mortality in acute pancreatitis . but are not recommended for prophylactic use in severe acute pancreatitis, even in the presence of sterile necrosis . However, in patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis secondary to gallstones, when imaging and biochemical tests highly predict an obstructed CBD (even without cholangitis), ERCP will possibly reduce morbidity and mortality from acute pancreatitis . Surgical treatment may be required in necrotizing acute pancreatitis if infected necrosis is present or suspected (based on clinical deterioration or prolonged organ failure) . The principal purpose of surgery in severe acute pancreatitis is the removal of necrotic pancreatic tissue (necrosectomy) . Thus, from day 7 of a severe attack, all patients must undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan, repeated at 7-10-day intervals until there are signs of clinical improvement . SIRS is a feature of the first phase of acute pancreatitis, and as such is not regarded as a complication but as a manifestation of the disease . However, a severe SIRS response will promote systemic complications that lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) . Acute peripancreatic fluid collections are common in acute pancreatitis, even in mild acute pancreatitis . Infected pancreatic necrosis is a secondary infection of sterile pancreatic necrosis and develops in the later phase in 40-70% of patients with severe disease . Systemic complications . The assessment of several organ systems should be included . Likely systemic complications of acute pancreatitis include the following . Central nervous system disturbances, including coma . Follow-up . There are no long-term sequelae following recovery from mild acute pancreatitis . In severe necrotizing pancreatitis, however, there are significant late complications in up to 60% of patients . These include . Thus, long-term follow-up is required to monitor the development of these complications . More extensive use of emergency endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones in severe disease . Drugs that will modify the progression of mild to severe acute pancreatitis . 
However, the system that resists a decrease in fat stores is considerably more sensitive than the one that resists an increase in fat mass . Hence, in a permissive environment, or with poor lifestyle choices, fat mass gradually increases . Regulation of energy balance and fat mass . Weight loss leads to increased appetite and energy expenditure falls . Overfeeding results in decreased appetite and energy expenditure increases . However, the system that resists a decrease in fat stores is considerably more sensitive than the one that resists an increase in fat mass . Hence, in a permissive environment, or with poor lifestyle choices, fat mass gradually increases . Regulation of energy intake involves an afferent system, a central integrating system and an efferent system . Afferent system . Central integrating system . Effector system . Regulation of energy expenditure involves basal metabolic rate (BMR); physical activity level (intentional, incidental and non-exercise-associated thermogenesis [NEAT]); and the thermic effect of food . Various factors may increase resting energy expenditure, including thyroid hormone, growth hormone and activation of the sympathetic nervous system . Physical activity level . Energy expenditure can vary substantially depending on the level of habitual physical activity . The physical activity level is the energy cost of physical activity, expressed as a multiple of 24-hour BMR . An expert panel of the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) suggested that a physical activity level range of 1.50-1.55 represented sedentary individuals . The categories shown in Table 2.1 represent the different levels of activity associated with a population's lifestyle . Non-exercise-associated thermogenesis is often neglected as a component of physical activity . NEAT has a high degree of heritability and may be an important defense against obesity . Thermic effect of food . Protein intake increases the thermic effect of food to a greater extent than equivalent amounts of carbohydrate or fat . Approximately 40% of the thermic effect of food is believed to be mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system . The thermic effect of food decreases with weight loss - an effect that persists in the post-obese state, thereby promoting weight regain . The 'obesogenic' environment . A decline in activity was possibly the major feature of the early rise in obesity levels in the 1960s to 1980s . It is therefore unlikely that decreased energy expenditure has fuelled the obesity epidemic . Persistent organic pollutants have been associated with obesity and obesity risk factors - so-called endocrine disrupters such as dioxin-like chemicals and pesticides . Medical conditions such as Cushing's disease and hypothyroidism may result in weight gain and/or changes in body composition . 'Obesity genes' . It is estimated that 50-70% of the variation in fat mass between individuals has a genetic basis, due to polygenic environmental interactions rather than individual 'obesity genes' . Individual 'obesity genes' are described periodically in the scientific press, but each has little relevance in the clinician's struggle against obesity . Prenatal maternal or paternal obesity, dietary patterns and even stress may result in changes to the genes of offspring that may predispose to obesity . Indian immigrants have been shown to experience increased levels of weight gain and obesity after entering the UK, and African American women have higher fat intake and less physical activity than their white counterparts . The nature of the built environment may also be an important factor in limiting both physical activity and food choice . An individual is particularly susceptible to weight gain and weight-related complications at various significant stages of life . The causes and issues relating to obesity in children are discussed in Chapter 9 . Co-habiting and meal sharing with a partner may also lead to increased energy consumption . In women, menopause tends to be associated with weight gain, particularly around the abdomen . Hormonal changes and decreased physical activity may be responsible, although the exact process is not fully understood . The causes and issues relating to obesity in the elderly are discussed in Chapter 9 . In developed countries obesity used to be linked with wealth, but in the 21st century obesity is now closely linked with deprivation . In the developed world, disadvantage is associated with . poor access to sports facilities . less physical activity outside work and less participation in sport . Individuals who change from an active to an inactive or sedentary lifestyle are inevitably at risk of becoming overweight/obese . 
The clinical symptoms of renal disease often do not become apparent until kidney failure is advanced . Screening for renal disease is, therefore, particularly important, because it may enable abnormalities to be detected in time for effective treatment to be started . Urinary abnormalities will be found in most patients with renal disease, particularly positive dipstick tests for blood or protein, or the presence of cells, casts, crystals or organisms on urine microscopy . Heavy proteinuria can produce unusually frothy urine, but this is not often reported spontaneously . Proteinuria may originate from anywhere within the urinary tract . High levels of protein in the urine (> 3 g/day) generally reflect the presence of albuminuria and point to a glomerular process (glomerular albuminuria) . One of the most common causes of low-level proteinuria is inflammation in the lower urinary tract, which is usually caused by urinary tract infection (UTI) (Table 1.1) . Urinary protein excretion increases during pregnancy, but never to more than 300 mg/day, so overt proteinuria is not physiological . Dipstick testing of the urine is designed to detect albumin and is insensitive to other proteins; it will not, therefore, generally detect light chains in myeloma . Proteinuria may be formally quantified using timed urine samples, usually a 24-hour specimen . The upper end of the normal range is 150 mg/24 hours . Whereas significant albuminuria often indicates intrinsic renal parenchymal disease, hematuria may be caused by lesions throughout the urinary tract, particularly infection or malignancy (Table 1.2) . In general, once UTI has been excluded, then hematuria without significant proteinuria should prompt a search for malignancy in older patients, while hematuria with proteinuria requires a search for a glomerular cause . Red-cell casts, in particular, generally indicate active glomerulonephritis . In most cases, significant albuminuria in addition to hematuria is seen in glomerular disease . Kidney function tests . Serum creatinine in pregnancy . No fall in serum creatinine during pregnancy can indicate significant renal functional impairment . Women with only mild renal impairment from any cause will usually have a successful pregnancy outcome, and will seldom incur any additional kidney damage as a result of the pregnancy . Some women, however, will have complications during the pregnancy itself, especially hypertension . Measurement of glomerular filtration rate . Creatinine clearance, which assesses creatinine excretion over 24 hours in relation to the serum creatinine level, is often used as a measure of GFR . However, it can overestimate GFR, since up to 25% of urinary creatinine may come from tubular secretion, and 24-hour urine collections are unreliable . It is also important to realize that a significant rise in serum creatinine does not occur until the GFR is reduced to about 50% of normal . Other blood tests . The diagnosis of many renal diseases is assisted by specific blood tests, particularly in glomerular disease . It should be noted that in pregnancy, glycosuria is common and does not usually indicate diabetes or even impaired glucose tolerance . The investigation of renal disease should always include some form of kidney imaging, which can provide both anatomic and functional information (Table 1.5) . Kidney biopsy . Percutaneous kidney biopsy can provide a definitive histological diagnosis of glomerular or interstitial disease . It is particularly helpful in patients with severe proteinuria, hematuria that is not due to disease of the lower urinary tract, and acute kidney failure thought to be caused by intrinsic renal disease (rather than prerenal disease, obstruction or acute tubular necrosis [ATN]) . The main diseases diagnosed by kidney biopsy include glomerulonephritis, glomerular disorders such as amyloid and diabetes, and interstitial nephritis . In the presence of microscopic hematuria alone, or albuminuria of less than 1 g/24 hours, kidney biopsy is often not indicated since it is unlikely that a specific treatment would be required . However, higher levels of albuminuria or the combination of albuminuria and hematuria (particularly with casts) are indications for biopsy, because a number of causes of glomerulonephritis (see Chapter 6) and interstitial nephritis are now amenable to therapy . 
Treatment of eating disorders requires a multidisciplinary team of professionals to provide the appropriate care for the patient . It is the responsibility of every team member to inform each other, as well as appropriate family members, of the patient's state . Together, the team decides what type of treatment is necessary along the continuum of care . inpatient care . residential care . The interventions used in treatment need to be developmentally appropriate . As this is a complex multifactorial group of disorders, caregivers must anticipate long-term care, as treatment may require months or even years . The primary care physician, throughout treatment, has several important functions . to diagnose and treat any chronic and/or acute symptoms and complications . to monitor the patient's physiological status, including shifts in weight, blood pressure, pulse and other cardiovascular parameters . to continually reappraise the patient's physical state in order to confront any denial . to inform other members of the treatment team and appropriate family members of the patient's physical state . The psychiatrist/psychotherapist also plays an important role throughout treatment . In one treatment model, the psychiatrist or psychotherapist solely manages the psychological needs of the patient; in another model, the psychiatrist manages both the general medical and psychological needs, with specialized assistance from a psychotherapist . In either model, the psychiatrist or psychotherapist has the following responsibilities . to assess eating-disorder symptoms and behaviors . to monitor the patient's psychological status, including behavior shifts, cognitions, and emotions . The dietitian oversees the nutritional counseling of the patient, providing several important functions . Treatment goals . The ultimate goal of treatment is both psychological and physical health . It is important to emphasize these definitions of recovery as opposed to defining recovery simply as weight gain or a temporary change in behavior . The psychological aspects of treatment can be divided into three levels . Physical health is attained when weight and menses have been restored in anorexia . The medical aspect of treatment involves monitoring for common complications such as . gastrointestinal symptoms . cardiac symptoms . Acute problems of eating disorders include . gastrointestinal symptoms such as delayed gastric emptying, constipation, irritable colon symptoms and esophageal disease (exempli gratia esophagitis, ruptures) . Chronic problems include . impaired acquisition of peak bone mass . Management of complications . Weight gain is important for the restoration of menses; 86% of patients who achieve 90% of their ideal bodyweight resume menses within 6 months . Again, weight gain is crucial as an increase in BMD relies primarily on bodyweight . Patients who achieve more than 85% of their ideal bodyweight show significant improvement in spinal bone mass . Hormone replacement therapy has not been shown to be effective at increasing bone mass in the treatment of eating disorders . Weight gain is vital to improving bone mass . Gastrointestinal symptoms . The following gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with eating disorders, particularly during the weight-restoration phase . As fear of eating and weight gain is characteristic of these patients, it may be difficult to distinguish between psychological distress and actual physical discomfort . Aggressive treatment is not necessary because these symptoms are adaptive and tend to resolve as normal eating patterns are established . However, the following medications can be prescribed to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms . Referral to a specialist is recommended for esophageal complications . Cardiac symptoms . This symptom is adaptive and will resolve with weight gain . If there is no junctional escape or other arrhythmia then the standard treatment for anorexia is sufficient . Inpatient admission may be needed for . cardiac monitoring . Side effects of psychopharmacological agents include . increased risk for suicide ideation . Follow-up . Ongoing monitoring is driven by . drug and dietary control of medication abuse . In the weight-restoration phase patients should be seen weekly . As patients achieve weight gain beyond the 85% ideal, and approaching 100%, they can be seen less frequently and monthly visits may suffice . When patients are asymptomatic and weight is restored, follow-up visits can be as infrequent as once or twice a year for 4 years after onset, as this is the period in which patients are generally considered vulnerable to relapse . 
Pain chronification and interdisciplinary stepped care . The stepped care model . Interdisciplinary care . Treatment is not 'one size fits all' . Shared electronic medical records facilitate this process . Effectiveness of interdisciplinary treatment . The magnitude of the effect of an interdisciplinary approach ranges from slight to moderate . The benefits are less clear when an interdisciplinary approach supplements other standard treatment . However, when added to a pharmacotherapy program this positive effect is not observed . The intensity of the interdisciplinary program also seems relevant . Further research . Active self-management . Self-management does not mean leaving the patient to their own devices . Physical activity . Weight management . 'Passive' management . There are also a number of invasive passive techniques (see below) . It can also mean the use of a combination of analgesics acting at different targets . Such an approach aims to optimize pain relief while minimizing the risks of unwanted side effects . The pharmacotherapy of pain is currently hampered by . a lack of drugs with selective action on targets of relevance to pain . a lack of drugs with reliable potency across a wide population . Mechanism of action . Opioid receptors are coupled to ion channels via G proteins . When activated, these receptors modulate calcium and potassium entry into the neuronal membrane . Guidelines on use . There is clear evidence that certain factors increase the risk of unintentional overdose . Recommendations include . avoiding opioids as a first-line treatment . evaluating and managing risks in all cases . stopping opioids when they are not effective and avoiding escalation to higher doses . It is also very short acting and has a high risk of abuse . Effect size . Study results have shown that 1 in every 3 individuals taking morphine obtains substantial pain relief . Adverse effects . Route of administration . Yet clinical experience indicates that tolerance to opioid analgesia is rarely the sole reason for dose escalation . Opioid rotation . If uncleared, these metabolites could antagonize opioid analgesia . Risk of addiction . Addiction is distinct from physical dependence, although the terms are sometimes inaccurately used interchangeably . Physical dependence is of little clinical importance as long as abrupt discontinuation of therapy is avoided . Short-acting oral opioids are used for this purpose . Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of these new options . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . Mechanism of action . All of these actions decrease nociceptive transmission and produce analgesia . NSAIDs also affect nuclear transcription factors and ion (K +) channel function . Ceiling and dose-sparing effects . Celecoxib remains on the market . Effect size . Adverse effects . For a healthy adult, the maximum daily dose of paracetamol is 4 g . Therefore, they should not be considered as first-line therapy . Nevertheless, there is some evidence of carry-over from one neuropathic pain type to another . Antidepressants act as analgesics via a wide range of mechanisms . TCAs and SNRIs are superior to SSRIs . Invasive procedures . Neurolytic celiac plexus block . The procedure is routinely carried out under guidance of fluoroscopy or CT scan . Burton et al . have published a detailed evaluation of risks and benefits . This procedure requires considerable skill and experience and few centers currently have this expertise . Radiofrequency lesioning . Such problems may be amenable to radiofrequency lesioning . The efficacy of ISDA has been confirmed in a randomized clinical trial . It is approved in the USA for morphine-resistant pain . The drug delivery component is described above . However, it is likely that electrical and pharmacological applications will be combined in the near future . The closed loop system is now in the final stages of clinical trials . Peripheral nerve stimulation . Results of studies with follow up to at least 1 year are awaited . The needles used to insert the electrodes have also improved . SNS has the potential to transform many such patients' lives . 
In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pathological changes occur in the central conducting airways, the peripheral airways, the lung parenchyma and the pulmonary vasculature (Figure 1.1) . Current concepts suggest that inflammation induced by cigarette smoke underlies most pathological lesions associated with COPD . The inflammation damages lung structures, and individuals who are unable to repair this damage develop tissue alterations and functional compromise . Inflammation also contributes to recurrent exacerbations of COPD, in which acute inflammation is superimposed on the chronic disease . There is now good evidence that all smokers develop lung inflammation; however, some individuals are more susceptible to the effects of cigarette smoke and are more severely affected . The pathogenesis of COPD in non-smokers has not been studied as much, but inflammation secondary to air pollution or other substances is likely to play a key role . The extent of the pathological changes in the different lung compartments varies between individuals and results in the clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity seen in patients with COPD . Some believe that chronic asthma should be included as part of the spectrum of COPD . Although the clinical and physiological presentation of chronic asthma may be indistinguishable from that of COPD, the pathological changes are distinct from those in most COPD cases due to cigarette smoking . Histological features of COPD in the 15-20% of patients who are non-smokers have not been well studied . Chronic bronchitis . In smokers, however, goblet cells are not only present in increased numbers but also extend more peripherally . Studies have reported increased numbers of neutrophils in the intraluminal space in patients with stable COPD . Some patients with COPD, however, have a T helper cell (Th)2-type inflammation, similar to that present in asthma . Neutrophils are present, particularly in the glands, in most patients with COPD, and become more prominent as the disease progresses . Nevertheless, some patients have minimal inflammation . A subset of COPD patients with eosinophils in their sputum has been described; these patients are more responsive to inhaled glucocorticoids . Small-airways disease/bronchiolitis . Inflammation in the small airways is one of the earliest changes in asymptomatic cigarette smokers, and considerable changes in these airways can occur without giving rise to symptoms or alteration in spirometry measurements . With severe disease, the number of small airways is reduced . Pulmonary emphysema . Pulmonary emphysema can also be detected radiographically, as discussed in Chapter 5 . Other, less common forms may also occur . Periacinar emphysema is now a recognized emphysema pattern in smokers . Pulmonary vasculature . The vasculature of the lung may be affected in several ways . The development of chronic alveolar hypoxia in patients with COPD results in hypoxic vasoconstriction of the small pulmonary arteries and, consequently, an inflammatory response in the arteries similar to that in the lungs . Right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension are common in patients with advanced COPD who have chronic hypoxemia . The pathological changes in patients with COPD are complex and may occur to varying extents in the large and small airways, and in the alveolar compartment . Consistent with this, decreased airway circumference correlates well with airflow limitation, as does reduced numbers of small airways in patients with moderately severe COPD when assessed on specimens removed surgically . Hyperinflation reduces the inspiratory capacity so that the functional residual capacity increases, particularly during exercise . Enhanced inflammatory response . The normal inflammatory response in the lungs to the inhalation of irritants, such as cigarette smoke, appears to be enhanced and abnormally persistent in patients with COPD . The factors responsible for the amplification of inflammation in COPD are not fully understood, but may involve genetic and epigenetic mechanisms . Altered structural cell function . Structural cells obtained from the lungs of patients with COPD have been shown to manifest persistently altered functions when cultured in vitro, perhaps as a result of epigenetic modifications . Lung cells have increased sensitivity to apoptosis, mediate repair functions less well and produce increased amounts of inflammatory mediators . The altered function of structural cells may account for the persistence of inflammation and progression of COPD, once established, even if cigarette smoking is stopped . 
In the emergency room, a CT scan is the most useful imaging test for diagnosing AP, followed by MRI; conventional ultrasonography is less reliable . CT/MRI to confirm the diagnosis of AP should be reserved for cases with atypical symptoms and/or those rare cases without an increase in pancreatic enzyme serum levels . AP may be present regardless of a normal CT scan, MRI or ultrasonography . abdominal pain consistent with AP (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain, often radiating to the back) . serum amylase or lipase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal . characteristic findings of AP on a contrast-enhanced CT scan or, less commonly, MRI or transabdominal ultrasonography . Most patients can be diagnosed on the basis of the first two criteria, with imaging required only in individuals with atypical symptoms or low serum enzyme activity . Signs and symptoms . Most patients with AP have a severe epigastric pain radiating to the flanks and/or back, together with nausea and vomiting . Exceptions are patients under immunosuppression or sedation and patients with dementia, in whom the diagnosis may be challenging . Jaundice is frequently seen in cases of persistent choledocholithiasis, or more infrequently in patients with compression of the bile duct due to inflammation and/or collections (in these cases the jaundice usually develops days or weeks after presentation) . Paralytic ileus may develop in some patients, and infrequently it may be persistent because of inflammatory or ischemic involvement of the bowel . Some patients with moderate-to-severe AP may develop reversible neuropsychiatric symptoms (exempli gratia delirium, hallucinations, convulsive and/or focal seizures) in the absence of organic triggers; this rare complication is known as pancreatic encephalopathy . Very infrequently, patients with AP may develop ecchymosis of the skin either periumbilically (Cullen's sign), on the flanks (Grey Turner's sign), on the inguinal ligament (Fox's sign) or in the scrotum (Bryant's sign) due to necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis from subcutaneous infiltration of inflammatory exudates from the retroperitoneum (Figure 3.1) . These signs have been linked with a poor prognosis . Other rare symptoms and signs of AP are the development of tender subcutaneous nodules (pancreatic panniculitis due to circulating lipase-induced digestion of subcutaneous fat) (see Figure 3.1) and loss of vision due to Purtscher retinopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome . Blood and urine tests . Most patients with AP have amylase and/or lipase serum activity greater than three times the upper level of normal . The amylase increase is first detected 2-12 hours after the onset of symptoms of AP; the level peaks at 12-72 hours and usually normalizes within 5 days . Serum lipase levels increase within 4-8 hours after the onset of symptoms; they peak at 24 hours, and return to normal after 8-14 days . The half-life of lipase is longer than amylase, so patients with a delayed presentation in the emergency room may show normal amylase activity with increased lipase activity . Urinary trypsinogen-2 and urinary amylase are also increased in AP . There is no evidence supporting the superiority of any one serum or urinary test over another in terms of accuracy . Hypertriglyceridemia (> 500 mg/mL) may be associated with falsely low levels of amylase and lipase activity . This is likely to be due to interference with the assay and so, in patients with lipemic plasma and typical symptoms of AP but unexpectedly low levels of pancreatic enzyme activity, the plasma can be serially diluted and the enzymes measured again, or imaging should be performed . Increased serum pancreatic enzyme activity may also be due to other conditions (Table 3.1 and Table 3.2) and about 1 in 10 patients may be wrongly diagnosed as having AP by blood or urinary tests . As indicated in Table 3.1, any cause of acute abdomen may be associated with increased enzyme activity in blood; in general, the more elevated the pancreatic enzyme activity level, the greater the specificity for AP . 
Retrospective series have not compared outcomes in patients who undergo transplant versus those who achieved similar responses but did not undergo transplant . Autologous stem cell transplantation . In addition, the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) is low because the patient receives a transplant of their own cells . Evidence for and against upfront ASCT . In intent-to-treat (ITT) studies, 40-73% of patients proceeded to transplant, while the remaining patients developed either progressive disease or comorbidities that precluded ASCT . In the longer term, 28 patients (18%) experienced disease relapse within 2 years and 11 (7%) patients experienced relapse beyond 2 years . Fifty-five of the patients (66%) proceeded to transplantation . Half of the patients (43; 52%) were alive at a median of 33 months' follow up . Three-year OS and PFS rates were 48% and 36%, respectively . Han and colleagues reported a retrospective analysis of ASCT in 46 Chinese patients . CR was achieved before transplant in 34 patients and PR in 12 . The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 62% and 77%, respectively (median follow-up 37 months; range 6-176) . The 3-year PFS and OS rates for patients beyond CR1 were 42% and 53%, respectively . Multivariate analysis showed that ASCT was associated with superior OS for patients who achieved CR . Half the patients (n = 134) went on to ASCT (ITT) . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation . AlloSCT in refractory/relapsed disease . The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 53% and 57%, respectively, and were influenced by disease status at the time of transplant . Patients who did not achieve CR after alloSCT died within the 10 months' follow-up . The 5-year TRM rate was 33%, largely associated with the use of mismatched donors . Fifteen patients had relapsed disease and two had primary refractory disease . In two patients who had disease relapse after transplantation, a response was induced by the infusion of donor lymphocytes, confirming a GVL effect . The CIBMTR study has also published outcomes from a large cohort of heavily pretreated patients (n = 126; median age at transplant, 38 years) . AlloSCT at first remission . In this ITT study, 29 of 49 patients (60%) proceeded to allograft . One- and 2-year OS rates after transplant were 76% and 72.5%, respectively and the TRM at 1 year was 8.2% . For patients who did not proceed to alloSCT, 2-year PFS was less than 30% . A large Japanese registry study reported median OS following alloSCT of 9.9 months and a 3-year OS rate of 36% . One patient whose disease relapsed after alloSCT responded to immunosuppression withdrawal but ultimately succumbed to GVHD . Hence, alloSCT should be offered for fit and eligible patients in CR1 . At the time of transplant, 45% of patients were in CR, 30% were in PR and 12% had chemorefractory disease . The 3-year OS and PFS rates were 34% and 28%, respectively; no relapses were seen 2 years after transplant . Published literature are limited because of the rarity of the disease although a systematic review of transplant outcomes has been reported . A total of 54 patients were identified, with a median age at transplantation of 34 years; 94% had stage IV disease . Post-transplant outcomes data were available for 44 patients . The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation reported outcomes for 18 patients who underwent alloSCT: at a median follow up of 3 years, 2 patients had disease relapse post-transplant and the 3-year PFS was 48% . Before transplant, 40 patients were in CR and 2 were in PR . Twenty-one patients received alloSCT and 39 received ASCT (a higher proportion of patients in CR received ASCT) . This study demonstrates the potential of GVL in patients with high-risk PTCL even if CR or PR is not achieved before transplant . Complications of transplant . The risk of neoplasms appears to peak 5 years after transplant . Better understanding of disease biology may change this approach . 
As a result, major progress has been made in the treatment of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy . The acute phase of chemotherapy has been arbitrarily determined as the initial 24 hours after chemotherapy infusion, and the delayed phase defined as any time in the 96 hours after the acute phase (24-120 hours after chemotherapy) . International guidelines recommend that 5-HT RAs be given only on the day of chemotherapy . The oral dose is 1-2 mg/day . Efficacy in acute CINV . Efficacy over repeated chemotherapy cycles . Efficacy over multiple-day chemotherapy cycles . The effectiveness of granisetron in the management of nausea and vomiting induced by multiple-day chemotherapy was evaluated in two comparative studies comprising 481 patients . Patients received their first course of chemotherapy (cisplatin, ifosfamide or etoposide) divided over 5 days . Granisetron was superior on day 1 in both trials . Efficacy in delayed CINV . The efficacy of a single dose of intravenous granisetron, 40 μg/kg or 3 mg, was assessed in a multicenter study over a 7-day period, with 533 patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy (275 mg/m) . This alternative route of administration may be well suited for patients who are unable to take oral treatments, and has the potential of improving patient adherence to treatment . Efficacy in acute CINV . Efficacy over multiple-day chemotherapy cycles . Efficacy in delayed CINV . Most early CINV studies reported poor control of delayed nausea and vomiting with ondansetron . The recommended dose is 5 mg intravenously or orally . The infusion is administered shortly before chemotherapy . Efficacy in acute CINV . Dose-finding studies demonstrated that tropisetron, 5 mg, provided total control of vomiting in up to 70% of patients during the first 24 hours after chemotherapy . Single oral or intravenous doses of dolasetron have shown efficacy in preventing acute CINV . The recommended dose is 5 mg intravenously or orally . The infusion is administered shortly before chemotherapy . Efficacy in acute CINV . The recommended dose is 0.25 mg intravenously or 0.5 mg orally . Fosaprepitant is an intravenous formulation that can be used in place of the oral dose of aprepitant on day 1 . It may be advantageous in patients who cannot tolerate an oral formulation . Aprepitant is administered as three doses taken orally: 125 mg before chemotherapy on day 1, followed by 80 mg on days 2 and 3 . Fosaprepitant is administered as a 150 mg intravenous injection before chemotherapy on day 1 . The two trials evaluated 523 and 521 patients for efficacy and 568 and 525 patients for safety, respectively . A separate randomized trial compared 3 days of aprepitant plus day-1 ondansetron and 4 days of dexamethasone to 4 days of ondansetron plus dexamethasone in 489 patients receiving multiple-day HEC . Efficacy in AC-based chemotherapy . Efficacy in MEC . Special consideration should be given to aprepitant in patients receiving non-AC-based MEC . It is licensed for the treatment of delayed CINV . Rolapitant is administered as a single oral dose of 180 mg before chemotherapy on day 1 of treatment . Patients received oral rolapitant, 180 mg, or placebo before HEC administration . Efficacy in MEC . This effect continued over multiple cycles of treatment . Treatment was given before chemotherapy on day 1 . Patients in all treatment arms were given oral dexamethasone on days 1-4 . The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response for the overall phase (0-120 hours) . The 300-mg NEPA dose showed a numerical improvement over the lower doses . Efficacy in AC-based chemotherapy . Most patients were Caucasian women undergoing treatment for breast cancer . Some studies have evaluated ginger's potential in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea . However, more severe delayed nausea was reported by patients than acute nausea . Proper administration of antiemetics reduces CINV and improves patients' quality of life, such that patients are more likely to undergo subsequent chemotherapy cycles . 
This totality of experience available with the original reference product can highlight issues such as immunogenicity or multiple potential mechanisms of action that will be critical in developing follow-on products . Manufacturers and regulators define quality according to critical 'quality attributes': chemical, physical and biological properties that need to be within agreed tolerances . Advances in analytical technology have permitted detailed characterization of the active ingredients in biologics . Importantly, for biosimilarity with a reference protein product, it is necessary to demonstrate that the amino acid sequence (primary structure) and higher order structure is the same . The upper and lower limits of the tolerance are referred to as the 'developmental corridor' (Figure 3.1); quality control monitoring of production batches by manufacturers ensures that the product reaching the patient is within the developmental corridor, such that a predictable effect can be expected . Once biosimilarity at a molecular level is established, it is confirmed through limited clinical trials (see Chapter 4) . Batches of biologics vary over time, and this is true for both the originator and biosimilar drug . Clinical studies of an originator drug to support different indications are likely to have been conducted with different batches . Indeed, it is possible that a biosimilar batch could more closely share critical attributes of that (originator) batch than the current batch . A change in the production process of a biological drug (originator or biosimilar) could affect outcomes . For this reason, manufacturing changes are regulated to ensure that new batches of product meet the defined critical attributes . The regulation of biosimilar production is based on the procedures developed to address changes to manufacturing of originator biologics . Biologic and biosimilar drug developers can determine the natural variation in the structure and biopotency of the reference drug from sequential batches of the drug . Variation in these attributes over time defines the limits of acceptable analytic differences that a regulator accepts between a reference drug and its biosimilar and so defines the development corridor for a biosimilar . In some circumstances, a biosimilar that has a notable difference in a critical attribute from the reference product may be permitted by regulators, as in the example of epoetin alfa: a biosimilar version is available that has a relatively high level of phosphorylated mannose-type structures (compared with the reference compound) . The European Medicines Agency accepted this difference on the basis that these structures are considered to be common glycoforms of recombinant erythropoietins and that their presence has been described in the literature for other recombinant cytokines and a large variety of non-lysosomal proteins from human plasma . The level observed did not affect the efficacy or safety . Immunogenicity is a potential safety concern with any biological agent, and even slight changes in structural properties or impurities could, in theory, trigger an adverse immune reaction . Product drift over time and evolution through manufacturing changes may produce structural differences in a reference biologic, meaning that no biologic can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . Immunogenicity cannot yet be predicted from analytic or animal studies with sufficient accuracy for biologic medicines . For this reason, clinical studies in humans remain a current requirement for biosimilar medicines (though not routinely required for a biologic drug undergoing a manufacturing change or small molecule generics) . Regulators are concerned to identify differences in toxic potential such as acute anaphylaxis or reductions in efficacy through the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies that increase the clearance of the drug . Immunogenicity is monitored both pre- and post-marketing . Biosimilars do not have to show that they have no immunogenicity - just that the levels are similar to those of the originator . Concerns about immunogenicity appear to be generally unfounded and, as discussed on page 63, European approved biosimilars have not been associated with any increase in the incidence of such adverse events . In contrast, documented immunogenicity differences with clinical impact have been reported for originator medicines undergoing manufacturing changes and with intended copy biologic drugs from less regulated medical regions of the world . Figure 3.2 illustrates immunogenicity data for biosimilar adalimumab and Humira . 
In general, patients with slowly progressive psychotic symptoms without any somatic symptoms are unlikely to benefit from an evaluation for infection . Assessing non-PD dementia . Overall, the cortical pathology related to PD is the main cause of progressive cognitive decline in about 95% of people with PD who develop dementia . Changes in the people who populate the patient's environment may trigger similar problems . Medication review . When non-PD medications cannot be reduced further, the medications used for PD motor function need to be considered . Pharmacological treatment . Most of the atypical antipsychotic drugs have been used to treat PDP and have been the subjects of small clinical trials . Initially, it showed extremely good efficacy and tolerance in open-label reports . Motor worsening, the main concern, was not reported, and there was an improvement in psychosis within a few days, sometimes overnight . Dosing and efficacy . Improvement was evident within 1 week of drug initiation . Clozapine also has a beneficial effect on PD tremor and has been used to treat tremor that is otherwise drug refractory . Clozapine may cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome . Thus, as newer SGAs became available they were used to treat PDP . Risperidone, which is primarily indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and disrupted and aggressive disorders in demented patients, was initially reported to be non-inferior to clozapine in the treatment of PDP, without motor worsening, but subsequent reports described severe motor worsening in patients with PD . Ultimately, the common observation that risperidone caused parkinsonism in young, neurologically normal people prevented its use for the treatment of PDP . It was therefore hoped that the drug would ameliorate psychosis without worsening parkinsonism . It has also been found to induce parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia in non-PD patients . It has produced conflicting results in patients with PDP . One open-label study reported excellent results, with good psychosis response and no motor worsening, but a double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial found no benefit . Quetiapine, which is approved for use in schizophrenia and psychosis associated with bipolar disorder and severe depression, has been reported in numerous open-label reports in people with PD to be an effective antipsychotic that does not worsen motor function (Case report 5.5) . Despite these trial results, many PD experts in the USA continue to use quetiapine for patients with PDP . Side effect profiles must always be considered when selecting drug treatments . Both drugs also carry the risk of orthostatic hypotension, a common problem for people with PD (Case report 5.6) . This should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time . The drug reaches steady state at 10-12 days for single daily dosing . Dosing and efficacy . In the phase III trial, 185 people with PDP were enrolled across 52 North American centers . Earlier trials . Recent open-label reports . A chart review from a different clinic reviewed 16 cases of PDP and 1 of DLB; 14 of the patients with PD also had dementia . Only 2 patients reported no benefit, and there were no significant side effects . The European study demonstrated better overall treatment response in people with visual hallucinations, but only one of the Japanese studies specifically reported the impact on psychotic symptoms, highlighting modest but significant benefit with donepezil treatment . Additional pharmacological treatment is usually required for more severe symptoms . Case series and open-label studies in people with PD treated with cholinesterase inhibitors report improvements in psychotic symptoms, - but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed . Antidepressants have been shown to improve psychotic symptoms in depressed patients with psychotic symptoms as well as patients with a history of depression and typical PDP symptoms . ECT has also been reported, albeit in rare case reports, to ameliorate PDP in patients with and without depression . Why ECT improves mood is unknown, as is the explanation for the improved motor function . Patients with primary psychiatric disorders who develop PDP are a relatively small group . Depression and anxiety often arise in patients with PD, but also bipolar disease, for which patients may already be taking antipsychotic drugs . looking for medical problems that may be contributing to psychotic symptoms . 
In relation to the most obvious symptom, ALS has understandably found itself historically classified among the neuromuscular disorders . 'Progressive' is the sine qua non of a diagnosis of ALS . It is reasonable to assume that, if untreated, ALS is always progressive, although the rate of spread of symptoms varies significantly between individuals . Such individuals represent a negligible minority within the diagnostic framework, and lack of symptom progression should always prompt reassessment . 'Painless' reflects the absence of prominent sensory involvement in ALS . The site of onset and pattern of spread of weakness in ALS varies but is not random . ALS results in progressive weakness of muscles beyond the site of the initial symptoms . The survival curve is skewed: 50% of people with ALS die within 3 years of first symptom onset, a further 45% of the original total die within 10 years and 5% survive into a second decade (Figure 1.2) . Measuring progression . Baseline covariates most frequently associated with a faster rate of decline in ALSFRS-R are older age at symptom onset and bulbar (rather than limb) site of symptom onset . The additional link between a faster rate in decline with shorter time to diagnosis from symptom onset arises because more aggressive disease is easier to diagnose . These include classification . by site of first symptom onset . Classification by upper versus lower motor neuron clinical signs . Despite attempts to define neurophysiological diagnostic criteria for ALS, the bedside clinical examination together with a compatible history of progressive weakness remains the gold standard for diagnosing ALS . 'Progressive muscular atrophy' . While at least 70% of cases of 'typical' ALS have clinical signs of both UMN and LMN involvement, at one end of the spectrum about 20% of ALS cases are dominated by muscle atrophy without clinical signs of UMN involvement (Figure 1.5a,b) . The mean age of onset of PLS is around 10 years younger than for typical ALS, usually with lower-limb or bulbar dysfunction . PMA and PLS (id est clinically pure LMN and UMN forms of progressive motor weakness) are currently excluded from the diagnostic criteria for ALS (see page 86) . Progression of weakness is notably slower as one moves to either extreme . Individuals with so-called PMA have a similar functional decline to ALS . The current diagnostic criteria for PLS require 4 years to have elapsed since symptom onset to ensure that no LMN signs have appeared . Classification by site of first symptom onset . Individuals with ALS are strikingly able to define the timing and site of onset of their first symptoms (Table 1.2) . The initial site of symptom onset typically retains the highest burden of progressive disability . The classification of ALS by the site of onset, typically spinal (limb) onset versus bulbar onset (see Figure 1.5b), reflects the often worse prognosis of those with bulbar onset . Classification by regional body involvement . There are several ALS phenotypes with strikingly limited physical regional involvement, initially at least (Figure 1.5c) . Flail arm phenotype . The onset may be unilateral but typically it becomes symmetric over months . The most consistent feature is markedly slower progression (in contrast to more common cases of upper-limb-onset ALS); survival up to 10 years and beyond is quite common . Although about one-third of ALS cases have a bulbar onset to symptoms, a distinctive phenotype of isolated, predominantly corticobulbar, palsy may be identified, typically in elderly women . Progression to anarthria is often quite rapid . Reports as early as the late 1800s noted rare but occasionally profound cognitive impairment in cases of otherwise typical ALS . Histopathological classification . As such, it is reasonable to consider the broad syndrome of ALS as a 'TDP-43-opathy' . Stratification by rate of progression . The major limitation of a unified TDP-43-based approach to the classification of ALS is the anatomic disconnection between the range of clinical phenotypes and rates of progression . For example, the bulbar onset of symptoms is under-represented among individuals with younger-onset disease . Given that molecular taxonomies of ALS transcend or confound attempts to produce clinical criteria for these variants, supports the view that ALS is more usefully stratified in terms of rate of symptom progression rather than variable sites and patterns of symptom onset and spread . 
Since the 1970s psychosocial interventions have been a key part of the management of schizophrenia . At that time, the adverse effect of institutionalization on people with schizophrenia came to be realized, and this led to the increased development of community-based services . More recently, specific psychological techniques aimed at improving aspects of schizophrenia have also been evaluated (Table 11.1) . Family interventions . The concept of high 'expressed emotion' within families as an environmental predictor of relapse in schizophrenia was suggested in the 1960s by Brown and Rutter . Families who showed overinvolvement or excessive criticism were associated with high relapse rates in individuals with schizophrenia . Whether the high expressed emotion was the cause of the poor prognosis, or partly the effect of illness severity, has not been resolved . Nevertheless, family-based interventions aimed at enhancing coping strategies by education about the illness (Table 11.2) have been shown to improve prognosis . A meta-analysis of the best randomized controlled trials, with a collective total of 350 patients and their families, found that such interventions, usually delivered over 9 months, were both effective and cost-effective . Patients who had family interventions showed lower relapse rates and improved drug compliance . Families valued the treatment and experienced less burden of care . This effect appears to be enduring and can be delivered to groups of families, with some evidence that this is the most cost-effective method . Family support combined with individual psychological techniques has been shown to reduce relapse rates in schizophrenia complicated by substance misuse . Psychological treatment of positive symptoms . The idea that cognitive behavioral treatments that are effective in people with major depression might be effective in treating positive psychotic symptoms dates from the 1990s . Coupled with the failure of psychoanalytical treatments for schizophrenia in the 1950s and 1960s, this view left a legacy of skepticism about psychological approaches . Since the mid-1990s, however, randomized controlled trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective for persistent psychotic symptoms in chronic schizophrenia when given in addition to routine care (Case history 11.1) . The effect size is about the same as that for clozapine . Secondary analyses of these trials suggest that as important as the actual CBT is the patient-rated 'therapeutic alliance' - the positive feelings of the patient towards the therapist . Trials have also shown that these techniques, added to drug treatment, may improve outcomes for psychotic symptoms in acute psychosis, including first-episode schizophrenia . This is a technique developed from research in addictions, based on disclosing and working with an individual's incentive to change behavior . It has been adapted as a potential intervention for people with schizophrenia who are non-adherent to pharmacological treatment . Initial promising results in people with a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and comorbid substance use have not been borne out . Cognitive remediation . Cognitive remediation involves processes such as repeated practice and scaffolding, a learning technique in which the therapist helps the patient to solve problems by providing support for aspects of the task that the patient cannot accomplish, while removing assistance in areas in which the patient is competent . These processes take place over days and weeks to train up key cognitive functions in chronic schizophrenia . It has been shown to deliver cognitive improvements that persist beyond the end of treatment, although generalization to improved functioning is more likely if an overall rehabilitation program is also given . Computer- and web-based cognitive remediation approaches are now available . Other non-drug treatments . People with schizophrenia should be supported in exploring other ways of managing their condition . Creative therapies (arts and crafts, music), nutritional supplements, horticulture, sporting activities and pet therapies have all be shown to be useful in building confidence, although there is no strong formal evidence of their effectiveness . 
It may also affect patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those who are treated with sulfonylureas or insulin . Hypoglycemia represents a considerable barrier to the goal of achievement of near-normal blood glucose levels in insulin-treated patients . It is feared by patients with diabetes treated with insulin and has the capacity to seriously disrupt their lives . The symptoms of hypoglycemia are listed in Table 10.1 . The initial symptoms of hypoglycemia are caused by sympathoadrenal activation . Such symptoms include sweating, shakiness, palpitation, anxiety and a sensation of hunger . Patients come to recognize their own hypoglycemic symptoms, which are often highly individualized . If hypoglycemia is not reversed promptly then patients may go on to develop symptoms due to neuroglycopenia (resulting from brain neuronal glucose deprivation) and these symptoms include behavioral changes, cognitive dysfunction and even seizures and coma . Less commonly, some patients may not experience initial sympathetic symptoms and present with neuroglycopenia, a complication known as hypoglycemic unawareness . Hypoglycemia unawareness is a potentially reversible situation with expert help . In people with type 1 diabetes, 2-4% of deaths have been attributed to hypoglycemia . People with type 1 diabetes experience symptomatic hypoglycemia on average twice per week, with significant disabling hypoglycemia occurring approximately once a year . Hypoglycemia is much less common in people with type 2 diabetes but frequently goes unrecognized . In the UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group, there was a low incidence of hypoglycemia in those taking oral hypoglycemic drugs, but an appreciable incidence in those on insulin therapy . Hypoglycemia may be experienced at a higher plasma glucose threshold in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, while patients with tightly controlled diabetes may tolerate remarkably low plasma glucose levels without experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms . It is generally recommended that patients avoid having glucose concentrations below 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL), as frequent exposure to glucose levels below this threshold may result in the aforementioned phenomenon of hypoglycemic unawareness . Lack of awareness of hypoglycemia poses a hazardous situation for those who are driving or exposed to heavy machinery or other dangers . Hypoglycemia in diabetes is a consequence of absolute or relative excess of exogenously administered insulin or endogenous insulin secretion . The causes are shown in Table 10.2 . Death from hypoglycemia is rare, but it may follow excess alcohol consumption or deliberate insulin overdose . Occasionally, tragically unexpected deaths happen in young patients with type 1 diabetes; these often occur in bed and it has been speculated that they may result from hypoglycemia-induced cardiac dysrhythmias . Most episodes of hypoglycemia are self-treated and respond quickly to the ingestion of glucose tablets, fruit juices or a soft drink . As hypoglycemia may recur promptly, individuals are recommended to have a snack or meal once the initial hypoglycemia is corrected . When hypoglycemia is so severe that the patient is unwilling or unable to take anything orally, parenteral therapy is required . Partners, parents, relatives or close associates of people with type 1 diabetes should be taught how to inject the affected individual with glucagon, 1 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously (followed by the ingestion of carbohydrates to restore hepatic glycogen) . If this is not effective within 10 minutes, medical staff should administer 50 mL of 20% glucose by intravenous infusion into a large vein through a large-gauge needle . If 10% glucose is used, a larger volume will be required to correct the hypoglycemia . A 50% glucose solution is not recommended because of irritant damage to veins . Follow-up . In all instances it is important that efforts be made to identify the cause of hypoglycemia, particularly when it is recurrent or unrecognized by the individual, and to formulate a suitable course of action to prevent future hypoglycemic events . 
Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction . Disorders of the sphincter of Oddi may present as sphincter stenosis or dyskinesia . Sphincter of Oddi stenosis is an actual anatomic narrowing of the sphincter, caused by inflammation, pancreatitis, gallstone passage or other unusual causes . Sphincter dyskinesia on the other hand is a spastic functional disorder of the sphincter, the cause of which is poorly understood . Dysfunction mostly occurs after cholecystectomy, but it may occur in a patient with an intact gallbladder; this occurs more often in young women . The classification of the disorders of the biliary and pancreatic sphincters is described in Table 7.1 . Symptoms and signs include biliary-type pain and, in some patients, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may present as recurrent pancreatitis . Sphincter of Oddi manometry is the diagnostic gold standard . The biliary and pancreatic duct pressures are measured; an elevated basal pressure above 40 mmHg is diagnostic . Sphincter of Oddi manometry could be considered to confirm a diagnosis of type II biliary dysfunction . Hepatobiliary scintigraphy with technetium-99m may help establish the existence of delayed biliary drainage and support a diagnosis of biliary sphincter dysfunction . Medical treatment . Oral nifedipine has been found to relieve pain in patients who had previously undergone cholecystectomy, and who had elevated basal pressure and sphincter of Oddi phasic contractions of predominantly antegrade nature . Endoscopic treatment for all types of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction takes the form of biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy during ERCP . Patients with type I biliary sphincter dysfunction respond well to sphincterotomy, which can be performed without manometry of the biliary sphincter . Type III biliary dysfunction is the hardest to treat, and there is no clear consensus on or understanding of invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment with sphincterotomy or the existence of other contributing or alternative causes of pain . Manometeric pressure abnormalities were not associated with the sphincterotomy outcome . This study mostly involved patients in the type III sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group . Based on this evidence-based study, some have suggested that sphincter of Oddi dysfunction type III is not a real disease and one should not pursue manometry or ERCP in these patients . Gallbladder dyskinesia . Gallbladder dyskinesia is a disorder caused by abnormal motility or contraction of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones . Surgical resection of a dysfunctional dyskinetic gallbladder reveals acalculous chronic cholecystitis in some patients . The pathogenesis is unclear but it is regarded as a motility disorder as patients frequently have other gastrointestinal motility disorders . Functional gallbladder disorder is a relatively new term used by some to describe gallbladder dyskinesia . Patients with other gastrointestinal motility disorders are likely to be at increased risk . An ejection fraction below 35-40% is considered abnormal and these patients are more likely to respond to cholecystectomy . In some patients the pain of gallbladder dyskinesia is reproduced when CCK is administered . Treatment is by cholecystectomy, usually laparoscopic . In patients whose gallbladder ejection fraction by CCK-stimulated scintigraphy is less than 35-40%, a significant number will experience improvement or resolution of pain following cholecystectomy . Before attempting cholecystectomy other diagnoses need to be eliminated as a cause for the patient's abdominal pain . Careful selection of appropriate patients for cholecystectomy must be undertaken . Treatment by cholecystectomy for this condition is controversial . Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and pain-causing mechanisms attributed to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction so far . Improved understanding of other diseases and mechanisms that cause pain similar to, or overlapping with, pain considered to be from sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and gallbladder dyskinesia/functional gallbladder disorder . 
Topical therapy is useful in nearly all acne regimens . mild localized acne . moderate acne; in combination with, and following, oral therapy . maintenance therapy; after stopping systemic agents for severe acne . The use of topical antibiotics as single agents for acne is discouraged because of the potential for the development of bacterial resistance . Topical agents differ in their efficacy against the various etiologic factors . Retinoids, azelaic acid and BPO are effective for comedones and inflammatory acne . Topical antibiotics such as erythromycin and clindamycin are most effective for inflammatory lesions . Retinoids and combination preparations can be used to treat non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions . acnes) strains . Patients often seek medical attention for their acne after trying a variety of over-the-counter products including soaps, scrubs, creams, lotions and gels . Active ingredients include BPO, salicylic acid and alpha-hydroxy acids . BPO is the most potent agent against P . acnes, an obligate anaerobe that will not grow in the presence of oxygen . Unlike antibiotics, BPO is bactericidal against P . acnes through its release of free oxygen radicals in sebaceous follicles . acnes, which translates into a reduction in new inflammatory lesions . acnes does not develop resistance to BPO; for this reason, the drug is a valuable component of any acne treatment regimen . BPO is generally used as a single agent and in combination products with topical antibiotics or the topical retinoid adapalene (see page 52) . Topical retinoids and retinoid-like molecules . Topical retinoids are effective agents in the treatment of acne . Tazarotene is very effective in comedonal and inflammatory acne . Tazarotene is licensed for the treatment of acne in the USA but only licensed for the treatment of psoriasis in the UK . Stability issues with a topical formulation were overcome with the development of a novel topical gel . The gel has been shown to be effective against acne at 5% concentration; recent studies suggest topical dapsone 5% gel may be particularly beneficial in regimens for adult women with acne (see pages 26-9) . Some salicylic acid products are tinted to help camouflage acne lesions . Combination products containing salicylic acid and BPO or sulfur are also available . The effectiveness of alpha-hydroxy acids in acne, however, has not yet been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials . It is available as a topical cream that has been shown to be effective in inflammatory and comedonal acne . acnes, azelaic acid reduces inflammatory acne . Topical antibiotics . acnes and reduce inflammatory lesions . acnes through competitive antagonism of para-aminobenzoic acid, an essential requirement for bacterial growth . Topical tetracycline is available in Italy, but not the UK or USA . acnes has developed resistance to both topical and oral antibiotics . acnes resistance has been shown to affect clinical outcomes of acne treatment . For these reasons, the use of topical antibiotics as single agents for acne is to be discouraged . Topical retinoids and BPO are useful as first-line agents . Any regimen containing an antibiotic (topical or oral), including a topical antibiotic/retinoid combination should be combined with BPO . Combination products . Recent advances in topical acne therapy include the development of fixed combination products that target more than one pathogenic feature of the disease and may also increase treatment adherence among patients . acnes (see pages 51 and) . A fixed combination of BPO with adapalene targets three of the four pathogenic features of acne without the use of antibiotics . Most topical acne treatments, including salicylic acid, BPO and topical retinoids will cause some degree of erythema, dryness and scaling of the skin . Excessive dryness of the skin is one of the main reasons why patients discontinue topical treatment . Thus, recommendations regarding effective ways of managing facial dryness should be an integral part of any acne treatment plan . Sunscreens are important, as the sun can exacerbate facial irritation caused by topical acne medications . Some topical preparations make patients more photosensitive . Alternative regimens . 
In contrast to gray matter, which contains neural cell bodies, white matter predominantly contains myelinated axon tracts . MS is characterized by the presence of multifocal lesions or 'plaques', predominantly in the white matter, which exhibit myelin destruction, perivascular inflammation and relative preservation of axons . It is now recognized that there is considerable gray matter involvement in MS as well as diffuse white matter pathology that contributes to long-standing disability . Lesion distribution . The number, size and distribution of lesions vary widely amongst individuals with MS . In early disease most patients have small circumscribed lesions that typically occur in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, corpus callosum, optic nerves, cerebellum and spinal cord (Figure 2.1) . Nowadays, more diffuse white matter pathology and early gray matter lesions are being seen using new MRI techniques, as well as in pathological studies . The whole brain volume loss seen early in the course of MS is likely to be associated with these diffuse as well as discrete changes of MS that lead to brain atrophy . Although disease may be macroscopically confined to the white matter, careful neuropathological evaluation reveals focal cortical and deep gray matter lesions in almost all patients with MS (Figure 2.2) . Many MS lesions are associated with cerebral vessels, and some contain a small central vein . Chronic lesions . Well-circumscribed, chronic, hypocellular, white matter plaques predominate in most patients with longstanding MS . The majority of these lesions are devoid of myelin and exhibit relative axonal preservation (Figure 2.3) . Acute lesions: implications for pathogenesis . Active lesions, which predominate in early relapsing MS, are defined pathologically by the presence of partially myelinated axons in tissue infiltrated by macrophages . When stained with Luxol fast-blue (a stain for myelin), these macrophages are found to contain myelin particles that are immunoreactive for myelin proteins (Figure 2.4) . The nature of the macrophage 'attack' on apparently normal myelin is unclear . This hypothesis has been challenged by the neuropathological interrogation of ultra-acute (newly forming) MS lesions, which are characterized by extensive loss of oligodendrocytes without significant T-cell infiltrates . Whatever the cause, myelin loss from axons proceeds rapidly and is usually complete within 2 weeks of symptom onset . Lesions examined during this time show a variable reduction in oligodendrocyte numbers and evidence of at least modest axonal injury . The periplaque white matter . New myelin is laid down by a population of oligodendrocytes that appears within lesions only days after an episode of acute inflammatory demyelination . These myelinating cells are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which must migrate from the periplaque white matter and mature before commencing the process of axon ensheathment . Although remyelination is the default response to demyelination in early relapsing disease, the process progressively fails with advancing disease and age in many patients . The subsequent loss of myelin-associated trophic signals contributes to axonal degeneration and the accrual of irreversible disability . Anti-LINGO1 is now being studied in relapsing forms of MS in a concurrent Phase II study . 'Neurodegeneration' and gray matter lesions . Although myelin appears to be 'targeted' in MS lesions, focal and diffuse axonal loss is present in the white matter of patients with relapsing and progressive forms of the disease (see pages 26 -) . Diffuse white matter axonal loss becomes most prominent in longstanding disease, and is accompanied by diffuse activation of microglia and the presence of scattered perivascular T-cell cuffs . While MS is traditionally regarded as a white matter disease, prominent demyelination, neuro-axonal injury and loss of synapses are present in the cortex and deep gray matter of patients with longstanding disease and underpin the cognitive and, to a lesser extent, motor dysfunction that characterizes this phase of the condition . Focal gray matter lesions are less inflammatory than their white matter counterparts, likely a reflection of reduced myelin density in the gray matter rather than any fundamental difference in lesion pathogenesis . Concordant with this finding, neuroimaging studies indicate that brain volume loss preferentially occurs in the gray matter in early relapsing MS . 
Liver disorders are encountered frequently in general practice . In the UK, while mortality rates from other major causes of disease are falling, mortality from liver disease continues to increase, and accounts for approximately 2% of all deaths in England . In the USA, recent data suggest that 5.5 million people have chronic liver disease . Many asymptomatic patients will have elevated liver test results, although the incidence varies considerably between populations with differing risk profiles . An organized approach to investigating liver abnormalities allows the physician to reach conclusions promptly, and avoids excessive cost or risk to the patient . Liver anatomy and physiology . Blood leaves the tissues of the liver via the hepatic veins . The liver is protected by the right lower ribs, so usually only a few centimeters can be felt on physical examination . In later disease stages, the liver may shrink and regress under the ribs, making it difficult or impossible to feel . Acute liver injuries . Patients with acute liver disease typically have no previous history of liver injury . Chronic liver injuries . The primary care provider more often encounters chronic, rather than acute, liver disease . The examiner may find stigmata of chronic liver disease, such as gynecomastia, spider nevi, telangiectasia and palmar erythema . The liver is usually enlarged and may be firm; a tender liver is uncommon . If advanced liver disease has developed (exempli gratia cirrhosis), signs of portal hypertension such as splenomegaly or ascites may be present . History of jaundice should be determined with respect to liver disease . Medications may also cause liver disease, so it is important to determine which medications a patient is taking, and particularly those temporally related to the development of the liver disorder . Some over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies have also been reported to cause liver abnormalities . A family history of liver disease is equally important . In our experience the liver disease that most commonly clusters in a family is alcoholic liver disease (ALD), but other diseases such as Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis (see Chapter 6) should be considered . Liver function tests . The liver typically responds to injury by releasing enzymes from hepatocytes and/or biliary epithelium . ALT is a cytoplasmic enzyme found primarily in the liver . Both AST and ALT are released from injured hepatocytes, and elevated levels are found in the blood of patients with liver disease of diverse etiologies . In most liver disorders, ALT is higher than AST . Patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase of hepatic origin usually have symptoms or signs of liver disease or other hepatic abnormalities on biochemical screening . Thus, in liver disease, 5NT and GGT will be elevated as well as the alkaline phosphatase, whereas in bone disease 5NT and GGT levels will be normal . Most clotting factors are produced by the liver . Occasionally, vitamin K deficiency and liver disease coincide . Thus, measurement of the albumin concentration is a reasonable test of the synthetic capacity of the liver . Malnutrition and liver disease frequently coexist . Injury of liver cells (exempli gratia in hepatitis or cirrhosis) is another cause of elevated bilirubin levels . Both acute and chronic liver disease may result in hyperbilirubinemia that is usually predominantly of the conjugated fraction . These patients only require reassurance . Radiology plays an important role in the evaluation of patients with some forms of liver disease . In addition, fatty infiltration of the liver can be diagnosed with reasonable sensitivity and specificity . A liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver disease . A liver biopsy usually allows a definitive diagnosis of the underlying liver disorder and staging of the disease (severity of permanent liver injury; fibrosis; cirrhosis) . Investigational pathways for mildly abnormal liver function tests . take a history of alcohol usage . Alcoholic liver disease . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is another explanation for this pattern of abnormal liver function tests . The liver function profile may underestimate the severity of the liver disease in a minority of patients . When the viral screen is negative, investigations should be extended to cover other causes of chronic liver disease . An ultrasound scan of the liver and possibly a liver biopsy complete the investigation in most instances . 
However, particular aspects of the anatomy and function of the urinary tract are relevant to understanding bladder disorders and should be familiar to anyone working in the field . The relevant anatomy of the urinary system is shown in Figure 1.1 . The term 'internal sphincter' is often used and refers to the smooth muscle of the bladder neck and proximal urethra . Control of the internal sphincter is involuntary . The term 'external sphincter' or 'external urethral sphincter' refers to the striated muscle that surrounds the proximal urethra and is under voluntary control . Some striated muscle also forms part of the urethra for a variable distance from the bladder neck . The entire striated sphincter complex is often referred to as the 'rhabdosphincter' . Continence is maintained by a complex interaction between the bladder, the urethra, the pelvic floor muscles, the endopelvic fascia and the nervous system . The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system, pressure increasing slowly and steadily as the bladder fills, normally at a rate of 0.5-5 mL/minute . A first need to void is felt when the bladder contains 250-300 mL . Continence is maintained as long as the urethral pressure exceeds the bladder pressure . During normal voiding, voluntary relaxation of the striated musculature in and around the urethra precedes contraction of the detrusor (bladder) muscle . The bladder neck and proximal urethra (often referred to as the 'bladder outlet') become funnel shaped . This relaxation/contraction combination reduces outflow resistance and increases intravesical (in the bladder) pressure, causing the bladder to be emptied forcibly . Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord and the micturition center in the midbrain . The innervation of the bladder is shown in Figure 1.2 . The main neurological pathways that affect bladder contraction are parasympathetic . The sacral reflex center is situated in S2 to S4, and the pelvic nerve and its branches lead from here to the detrusor muscle . Excitation of these nerves stimulates the release primarily of acetylcholine, which acts on muscarinic receptors to cause detrusor contraction . During normal bladder filling, there is no excitatory input from the micturition center in the brain to the sacral micturition center or from the sacral micturition center to the pelvic nerves . The detrusor (bladder) is quiescent . There is a gradual increase in the tone of the external sphincter (striated muscle), mediated through impulses via the pudendal nerve . Voiding depends on coordinated excitation of the sacral parasympathetic nerves and simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary); continence requires the converse (Table 1.1) . Storage and voluntary emptying of the bladder are also influenced by psychological and sociocultural factors . Adults are trained to void in a socially acceptable place and women may not want or like to void in any other place than their homes because of concern about unsafe or unsanitary toilet facilities . Using a toilet away from home can cause psychological stress, suppression of the desire to void and infrequent voiding . Voiding position and posture (exempli gratia squatting or sitting) used by women to empty the bladder differs by cultures or by health status . Negative perceptions of the physical environment of toilets can alter toileting stance or suppress the desire to void . Anatomy and function of the urinary system . 
According to the US 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet, the prevalence of diabetes in the US population is 8.3%, with estimates ranging from 5.8% in Vermont to 11.3% in Mississippi . Prevalence varies from 7.1% in non-Hispanic whites to 12.6% in non-Hispanic blacks (with even higher rates in Mexican Americans) . This equates to 18.8 million people with diabetes (and 7.0 million with undiagnosed diabetes) . Data from Diabetes UK reveals that 4.45% of the UK population had diabetes in 2011, equating to 2.9 million people . This figure is expected to grow to 5 million people by 2025 . In China, diabetes has become a major public health problem, with an estimated prevalence of 9.7% . It is clear that, of the 219 countries and territories monitored by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), some nations have substantially higher rates of diabetes . Data from the IDF's 2013 Diabetes Atlas show the highest national prevalence of diabetes in adults in selected Pacific Islands, including Tokelau, Micronesia, the Marshall islands, Kiribati, the Cook islands and Vanuatu, followed by Saudi Arabia (Table 1.1) . Worldwide comparative prevalence of diabetes is shown in Figure 1.1 . According to the IDF, diabetes caused 5.1 million deaths globally in 2013 - approximately 6% of total world mortality . Even more people have died from cardiovascular disease, the risk of which is increased by diabetes-related comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and renal disease . Data for deaths attributable to diabetes according to world regions are shown in Figure 1.2 . Indirect burden . Globally, most people with diabetes are in the age range 40-59 years, a time in which productivity at work and contribution to family life is anticipated . Illness, disability and premature death in this age group profoundly affect personal and family life, communities and national productivity . IDF data show that preventable complications of diabetes account for an additional 23 million years of life lost through disability and reduced quality of life . Predicted picture . Data extrapolations suggest the prevalence will continue to rise steeply and that by 2035, 592 million people will be affected . The IDF has identified several reasons for the steep increase anticipated in diabetes prevalence: overweight and obesity, unhealthy eating, sedentary lifestyles, urbanization and an aging population . In terms of the population-based burden of diabetes, China has the highest number of people affected, based on 2013 data collected by the IDF, followed by India and the USA (Table 1.2) . Rapid changes in lifestyle associated with westernization have led to large increases in the prevalence of diabetes throughout Asia . Of concern, recent data show no sign that the rate is slowing . People of Asian descent develop diabetes at lower degrees of obesity and at younger ages . There are also data to suggest Asian people suffer longer from diabetes complications and die earlier than people in other regions . An accelerating factor appears to be childhood obesity, which is increasing at alarming rates in Asia . Access to drugs . There are clear disparities between nations in access to drugs . About 80% of people with diabetes live in the world's poorest nations, but 80% of medical expenditure for diabetes occurs in the world's economically richest nations . Insulin is not available in many such areas because of its cost . Inevitably, people with type 1 diabetes who cannot access insulin die . Recent trends in children . Type 1 diabetes develops in about 79 000 children under the age of 14 every year . Recent data indicate the rate of new cases of type 1 diabetes is increasing by 3% every year, promoted by, among other factors, escalating rates of childhood obesity . About 25% of all cases of type 1 diabetes are in South East Asia, with about 20% in Europe . Finland, Sweden and Norway have the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes . Rates of type 1 diabetes also appear to be increasing in eastern European countries . The rate of type 2 diabetes is also increasing in children, though more data are required . 
Note these data are artificial, chosen to allow a simple explanation of the methodology . Two observations can be made from the data in Table 6.1 . First, on average, older subjects did less well . Second, there is a baseline imbalance in age . Table 6.2 presents the age distribution in terms of percentages . This is as expected . When this is corrected, there is a larger treatment effect . The calculation for the adjusted mean difference can also be shown as follows . The adjusted analysis is the correct analysis . It is routine to adjust for baseline imbalances in factors that influence outcome . The statistical technique for adjustment is called analysis of variance (ANOVA) . Other terms for the technique are adjusted or stratified analysis . Adjusting the analysis for binary and time-to-event endpoints . The same technique can be used for different types of endpoint . Note that the HR is already a measure of treatment difference . This technique is termed the stratified logrank test . Adjusting the analysis for multiple baseline factors . When adjusting for multiple baseline factors, however, the technique can break down . Assessing the dependence of outcome on baseline factors . What does the line demonstrate? The equation of a straight line is . Figure 6.2 shows the best fitting line in this case . The equation of this line is . This process is called least squares and the resulting line is called the least squares regression line . Evaluating dependence . Null hypothesis, H: b = 0, no dependence . Alternative hypothesis, H: b ≠ 0, dependence . A p -value is obtained, based on the calculated value for b . Multiple regression analysis . 0 = male, 1 = female . To investigate the dependence, the following equation is fitted to the data . This technique sorts out the correlation and identifies where the true dependence lies . Comparing groups while accounting for baseline imbalances . Analysis of covariance for a single covariate . It is an extension of the ANOVA introduced earlier . This assumption is discussed later . The fitted regression lines for these data are . Null hypothesis, H: c = 0, no treatment effect . ANCOVA corrects for those baseline imbalances . There are two aspects, however, that should be considered . This may not always be the case . These two aspects are discussed below . Analysis of covariance with multiple covariates . Statistical interactions . This may of course not be the case (Figure 6.6) . Note that the intercepts have been labeled a and a for convenience in this case . For this example, the best-fitting (least squares) regression lines are . The lines are displayed in Figure 6.7 . Residual variability . Residual variability is an additional element to the modeling framework . It is a model for what is expected to happen on average . This takes account of the patient-to-patient variability . Statistical modeling . Models for continuous and score endpoints with a single covariate . Regression (studying dependence) . mean y = a + bx . ANCOVA (adjusting for baseline imbalances) . mean y = a + cz + bx . This model reduces to . ANCOVA (investigating treatment x covariate interactions) . mean y = a + cz + bx + dx x z . This model reduces to . Models for binary and time-to-event endpoints . When the endpoint is binary the corresponding model is called the logistic model . Logistic regression is the term used when looking at dependence . log odds for the event = a + bx . To adjust for baseline imbalances, the model is . log odds for the event = a + cz + bx . When looking for dependence the model is expressed as . log hazard rate for the event = a + bx . To adjust for baseline imbalances the model is . log hazard rate for the event = a + cz + bx . 
Biopsy studies have shown increased numbers of leukocytes, particularly eosinophils, mast cells and T lymphocytes, in the airways together with increases in the markers of lymphocyte activation . Disease mechanisms . As asthma becomes more severe, the number of MC TC increases in the mucosa at the expense of MC T . Definition of asthma based on pathophysiology . Historically asthma has been defined as a disease characterized by the presence of eosinophils in mucosal inflammation . Such stratification of asthma, particularly in those with more severe disease, has implications for targeting therapy to those most responsive . Risk factors for asthma . Asthma is a complex condition, and its causes are not fully understood . host factors that predispose an individual to asthma . causal factors, which are environmental factors that influence susceptibility to the development of asthma in predisposed individuals . trigger factors, which are environmental factors that precipitate asthma exacerbations and/or cause symptoms to persist . Examples of these factors are shown in Table 1.3 . In any given individual, the development of asthma, and the occurrence of acute exacerbations, will be due to an interaction between numerous predisposing, environmental and occupational factors . Predisposing factors . The most important factor predisposing to most asthma is atopy, which is characterized by excessive IgE production in response to common environmental allergens (exempli gratia from dust mites, animals, pollens and fungi) . The prevalence of asthma increases with increasing serum IgE concentration . Atopic diseases, including asthma, have strong heritability, accounting for up to 50% of clinical expression . Severe persistent asthma in adults is more frequent in women . Clearly, genetic influences can modify the risk of an individual developing atopy and asthma . While no single gene has been identified as being causative for asthma, several genetic loci have been associated with increased asthma risk, particularly in certain environments resulting in a gene-environment interaction . It is likely that several of these may work synergistically to cause asthma in individuals exposed to appropriate environmental factors . However, with recent rapid lifestyle changes being seen in South East Asia and Africa, asthma and associated allergic disease are rapidly increasing in these parts of the world also, particularly in areas of intense urban development . This suggests that factors such as degree of exposure to microbial products or alterations in gastrointestinal flora may be protective for the development of asthma and atopy . Co-incident with the increase of asthma and allergic diseases is the increase in other autoimmune diseases such as juvenile diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease and juvenile arthritis . Dietary factors have been associated with asthma and allergic disease . In particular, lower levels of vitamin D have been associated with an increased prevalence of asthma and allergic disease in ecologic studies comparing disease rates in temperate and tropical environments . The relevance of different causes of asthma depends on individual exposure and when it occurs . In early childhood, inhaled allergens and infection appear to be important causal factors for asthma . In adults, cigarette smoking and exposure to occupational allergens are more likely to be important causal factors . Domestic mites appear to be the most common sources of indoor allergens . The most important allergen is the Fel d 1 allergen found in cat fur and saliva . Both indoor and outdoor fungi can act as allergens . The most important fungi to have been associated with asthma are Aspergillus and Alternaria . Chronic colonization of the airways with Aspergillus can be associated with severe asthma, particularly in those who are also allergic to this mold . Occupation-related factors are summarized in Table 1.4 . Exposure to cigarette smoke is one of the potentially modifiable causes of asthma . In adults, there is some evidence that smoking may increase the risk of developing asthma after exposure to some occupational sensitizers . In addition, current smoking is associated with an increase in symptoms and blunted response to preventive treatments, especially steroids . The relationship between asthma and dietary factors is unclear . The role of particular infections, such as rhinoviruses, as a cause of asthma in early life, is becoming increasingly well established, particularly in association with allergen exposure . Obesity is considered a major risk factor for asthma . Trigger factors can induce asthma by causing inflammation, provoking bronchial hyperresponsive airways to contract or both . 
Theoretically, patients in which an early prediction of severity can be made can then be monitored more carefully, allowing early detection and treatment of organ dysfunction . Predictors of severity can also identify patients who may benefit from contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) to detect local complications . Many clinical trials testing new drugs for AP only recruit patients with predicted severe disease . While attempts to predict the severity of AP should be made early in the course of disease, ultimately severity should be classified at discharge as mild, moderate or severe according to the presence or absence of local and systemic complications during the course of disease . Classification of severity is discussed in Chapter 5 . Basal characteristics associated with worse outcomes . Comorbidity and obesity are important factors associated with an increased risk of persistent organ failure (OF) and mortality . Only extreme age seems independently associated with increased mortality . Early signs and laboratory and imaging predictors of severity . Although initial symptoms are of no use for predicting severity, the following signs on early physical examination are associated with a higher probability of adverse outcomes . Signs of pleural effusion are common on pulmonary auscultation in patients with moderate-to-severe AP, particularly on the left side; pleural effusion on imaging in the emergency room has also been associated with a worse prognosis . Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) detected in the emergency room and/or a subsequent increase in BUN in the first 24 hours is associated with an increased risk of persistent OF and mortality . An increased hematocrit (>= 44%) on admission is associated with persistent OF and pancreatic necrosis . Local complications are associated with worse outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality (due to their association with SIRS and persistent OF) . CECT is the most commonly used imaging technique to detect local complications . However, CECT is associated with radiation exposure, so its use is inappropriate in patients with an obvious diagnosis of AP and predicted mild disease . CECT should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis and those who have predicted severe disease, persistent SIRS, the presence of signs or symptoms suggesting local complications (inability to resume oral feeding, persistent pain, palpable mass, fever, etc . or who develop acute abdomen . Imaging before the third or fourth day may result in underestimation of local complications . Two historically important scoring systems - the Balthazar score and the CT score (Table 4.1) - have been developed for assessing the severity of local complications in AP on the basis of findings on CT imaging . Most patients with local complications develop SIRS, and only patients with systemic inflammation are at risk of OF . Approximately 30% of patients have SIRS criteria at admission; almost half of them will develop transient or persistent OF . Persistent OF is a marker of severe disease and is associated with maximum morbidity and a high risk of mortality (52% according to a large prospective cohort study), whereas transient OF is associated with increased morbidity but a low rate of mortality (7%) . Scoring systems for predicting severity . Many scoring systems for predicting the severity of AP have been developed over the past five decades . The ideal scoring system should make an early (at admission or within the first 24 hours) prediction of severity and should be accurate . The APACHE-II score has been extensively validated in AP . The BISAP score was developed as a simple scoring system to be used at admission and consists of five dichotomous variables . S - presence of SIRS criteria . The presence of three or more of these variables predicts severe disease . Many scoring systems have low external validity because they were developed in referral centers with higher proportions of moderate-to-severe cases of AP . This gives a falsely high positive predictive value of the different methods for predicting severity compared with non-referral populations . In general, the predictors of severity have a high negative predictive value (as most patients will develop only mild disease) but a low-to-moderate positive predictive value . The personal experience of the authors suggests that SIRS, and especially persistent SIRS, is particularly useful in predicting severity . Recent guidelines on the initial medical treatment of AP from the American Gastroenterological Association point out that there are no studies investigating the clinical impact of using severity prediction tools in AP . 
Red eye, blurred vision and double vision are all common and important eye symptoms . However, you should also listen carefully to the patient for the presence of other symptoms that may indicate serious eye disease . Important symptoms . A combination of new-onset flashing lights and and new-onset floaters signals a higher likelihood of a retinal tear or detachment . Flashing lights . Patients with migraine often see flashing or sparkling lights before the onset of their headache; sometimes they experience these symptoms without their usual headache (acephalgic migraine) . Flashing lights that are not the prodrome of migraine are most commonly due to an age change in the vitreous called posterior vitreous detachment, in which the vitreous jelly pulls away from the retina . The resultant minor retinal traction causes retinal neurons to fire, and the patient then sees flashing lights . However, in a minority of patients the flashing lights are caused by significant retinal traction resulting in a retinal tear or detachment, which requires urgent laser or surgical treatment . However, new-onset floaters (gray, black or red spots, cobwebs or blobs) can be due to a retinal tear, retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, and require urgent assessment . Visual field loss . Table 5.1 outlines the different types of visual field defect in terms of how they are perceived by the patient, the anatomic site at which they occur and the causes of each type of defect . Persisting visual field loss is always due to serious eye, optic nerve or brain disease . Some patients will spontaneously mention that their vision is bad only in a certain area (exempli gratia only out to the side) in one or both eyes . Others will realize (if you ask them) that their blurred vision is only in part of the visual field (Figure 5.1), and some patients may be asymptomatic and the field defect only noted on examination . Causes include retinal disease, optic nerve disease, a pituitary tumor compressing the intracranial optic nerve/s or chiasm, and retrochiasmal stroke or brain tumor . Transient binocular homonymous field loss may occur as part of the migraine prodrome . This is usually a slowly expanding visual field defect surrounded by flashing lights or zig-zag lines (a scintillating scotoma) (Figure 5.2) . Transient homonymous visual field loss (usually without flashing lights) may also occur in vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) . Transient visual field loss in one eye is likely to be amaurosis fugax . Visual distortion (metamorphopsia) is almost always a symptom of macular (central retinal) disease (Figure 5.3) . If onset is sudden in elderly patients, it may be a warning sign of 'wet' age-related macular degeneration (AMD) . There are also many other macular diseases . Photophobia (sensitivity to light) can be the earliest symptom of iritis, before the eye becomes red or the vision becomes blurred . It is also important to check for non-ocular causes of photophobia (exempli gratia meningitis) . Eye pain or eye ache can occur in early acute glaucoma, scleritis or iritis, before the eye becomes red . Pain may also be referred to the eye from intracranial structures (exempli gratia those compressed by a brain tumor); common headaches or trigeminal neuralgia can also result in eye pain . Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) is a treatable but acutely sight- and life-threatening disease that only affects patients over the age of 50 . It is therefore important to ask any patient over 50 who has headaches or visual symptoms specifically whether they have any of the symptoms of temporal arteritis described in Table 5.2 . The only clinical sign of temporal arteritis (other than signs of its complications) is tenderness and/or non-pulsatility of the temporal arteries on palpation; however, this is often unreliable . Even if no visual symptoms are present initially, patients with untreated temporal arteritis can suddenly go permanently blind in one or both eyes, usually from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . If, however, the disease is suspected early, and the patient is referred urgently and is treated with high-dose steroids, visual loss and life-threatening complications can usually be prevented . 
Variable uptake of biosimilars: the European experience . By contrast, only six biosimilars are currently approved in the USA (Table 5.3) . While a biosimilar may have regulatory approval there may be a delay before sales can begin due to patent expiry dates . For example a biosimilar of adalimumab was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2017; however, the European patent of adalimumab-Humira TM doesn't expire until the last quarter of 2018, indicating that the product may not be available until early in 2019 . Despite positive reasons to embrace biosimilars, sales data show significant variation in uptake: for filgrastim, uptake varied between 1% of the potential use in Belgium to 94% in the UK . For biosimilar infliximab, more than 90% uptake was achieved in Denmark, Norway, and Finland, whereas sales in nearby Sweden were insignificant . Figure 5.1 illustrates the broad variation in the uptake of different classes of biosimilars across Europe . Clinician confidence . However, studies show that there is some way to go in building this confidence with biosimilars . A survey of Belgian clinicians, pharmacists, payers, and industry experts found that the barriers to biosimilar use fell into three categories . lack of confidence towards biosimilars by some stakeholders . uncertainty about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars . lack of financial incentive . The survey identified five major gaps in clinicians' understanding that had the potential to slow biosimilar uptake . defining biologics, biosimilars, and biosimilarity . understanding the approval process and the use of 'totality of evidence' to evaluate biosimilars . understanding that the safety and immunogenicity of a biosimilar are comparable to those of the originator biologic . understanding the rationale for extrapolation of indications . defining interchangeability and the related rules regarding pharmacy-level substitution . This rationale applies to most classes of biosimilar, as shown in Table 5.5 . Switching is discussed in more detail on page 62 . A managed program was used in the UK to encourage switching: the scheme was based on the concept of 'gain share', in which a portion of the anticipated savings from switching was reinvested in staffing . The economic case for biosimilar medicines . Despite this dramatic increase in drug volume, however, cost savings were realized through the prevention of neutropenia and the high associated cost of treatment . A similar pattern was seen in Sweden, where a five-fold increase in daily G-CSF usage was matched by 4-5% saving in the total drug budget . While filgrastim was only given to women who had already experienced one episode of neutropenia, filgrastim-Zarzio was also given to women at risk of neutropenia . Furthermore, the introduction of filgrastim-Zarzio also drove down the price of pegfilgrastim, a long-acting version of filgrastim that was still on patent . This is illustrated in Figure 5.2 . When tender price competition is taken into account (as in the UK and Sweden for filgrastims; see page 51), actual discounts may be significantly greater although less transparent . These cost savings are important in the face of the pressure on healthcare budgets in many nations . Biosimilars have also reversed negative decisions in heath technology assessments . For example, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) appraised epoetins (recombinant red cell growth factors) in the treatment of anemia due to cancer chemotherapy for the first time in 2008 (technology appraisal [TA] 142) . Whilst epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, and darbepoetin alfa were considered clinically effective in this indication, they were not cost-effective and NICE did not recommend their use in the National Health Service (NHS) . A policy of optimising biosimilar use and creating competition between manufacturers to drive price reductions is predicted to save €50-100 billion over 5 years in the EU M5 markets and the USA (see Figure 2.1) . It is not surprising, therefore, that prioritization of generic and biosimilar drugs is a central policy theme in the 2016 EU report Health Care and Long-Term Care Systems and Fiscal Sustainability . 
Monogenic forms of diabetes mellitus . Monogenic forms of diabetes account for 1-2% of diabetes . These forms of diabetes result from mutations affecting the genes that regulate beta cell function . They are commonly referred to as maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY), though the more correct name is monogenic diabetes . It is important to consider these forms of diabetes, as their treatment requirements can differ and they can be misclassified as type 1 or 2 diabetes . Monogenic diabetes is generally characterized by the onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (under 25 years) without ketoacidosis . The family history is usually positive for diabetes in two to three generations, which should raise the suspicion . About 10-15% of children diagnosed with diabetes are negative for autoantibodies . Monogenic diabetes should be considered as a cause in these children if there is a family history of diabetes . The commonest forms of monogenic diabetes are listed in Table 5.2 . Neonatal hyperglycemia . Individuals diagnosed before the age of 6 months are more likely to have monogenic diabetes than autoimmune beta cell destruction (type 1 diabetes) . Neonatal hyperglycemia is mostly due to mutations in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits) . This form of monogenic diabetes is best treated with oral sulfonylurea medication rather than insulin . Thus, making an accurate diagnosis in these circumstances affects clinical treatment . The majority of these cases occur as spontaneous mutations, and there is usually no family history . Familial fasting hyperglycemia . Mutations in the glucokinase gene results in familial mild fasting hyperglycemia (MODY2) . Treatment is generally not required . Hepatic nuclear factor mutations . There is often a strong family history of diabetes and the onset of hyperglycemia before the age of 25 years . HNF1A mutations (or MODY3) produce diabetes in adolescence or early adulthood . This is the commonest form of monogenic diabetes, accounting for about 58% of cases . Glycosuria is present early on, even before the development of hyperglycemia . With progressive beta cell failure, fasting hyperglycemia develops . Microvascular complications in this form of monogenic diabetes are predicted by glycemic control, just as for type 1 and type 2 diabetes . Interestingly, patients with this mutation appear to be more susceptible to ischemic heart disease, despite having the elevated HDL cholesterol that characterizes the condition . HNF1B (or MODY5) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes due to transcription factor mutation . Estimates suggest it accounts for 1% of all diabetes . HNF4A (or MODY1) mutations produce diabetes that appears very similar to that arising from mutations in HNF1A, with the distinction of a different lipid pattern . Again, diagnosis assists in clinical management as this form of diabetes responds to low-dose sulfonylurea therapy . Diabetes mellitus associated with other endocrine diseases . Diabetes can also occur in the context of other underlying endocrine diseases, such as Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis and pheochromocytoma . Clinical features of these conditions should be sought at diagnosis of diabetes, with biochemical confirmation . Treatment of the underlying condition usually results in amelioration of the hyperglycemia . Pancreatic disease . Conditions affecting the integrity of the pancreas can damage beta cells and result in hyperglycemia . Drug-induced diabetes mellitus . Hyperglycemia can result from a number of drugs that affect either insulin secretion or insulin action . Glucocorticoids can unmask an underlying susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, but can also induce hyperglycemia if used at high enough doses . Anti-HIV drugs also increase insulin resistance . HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, with some studies indicating a fourfold increase . Pentamidine, a drug used to treat pneumocystis infection in AIDS, is a beta cell toxin that has also been associated with inducing ketosis-prone diabetes that requires ongoing insulin therapy . Transplantation-associated diabetes mellitus . 
The preferred approach to revascularization - percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) - depends on the extent and severity of the lesions as identified by coronary angiography, potential infarct complications, the patient's condition and comorbidities . Percutaneous coronary intervention . The majority of PCIs are performed with the implantation of a stent(s) (Figure 3.1) . During PCI, access into the femoral artery in the leg (or the radial artery or brachial artery in the arm) is created by a device called an 'introducer needle' . Once access is gained, a sheath is placed in the opening to keep the artery open and control bleeding . A long, flexible, soft plastic tube called a guiding catheter is advanced through the sheath over a guidewire . The tip of the guiding catheter is placed at the origin of the coronary artery . The guiding catheter also allows for iodine-based radiopaque dyes to be injected into the coronary artery, so that lesion location and severity can be precisely assessed using real-time radiographic visualization . This enables the cardiologist to estimate the size of the coronary artery and select the type of balloon catheter and coronary guidewire to use . A coronary guidewire, which is an extremely thin wire with a radiopaque flexible tip, is then inserted through the guiding catheter and into the coronary artery . Still using real-time radiographic visualization, the wire is guided through the coronary artery to the site of the stenosis or blockage . The tip of the wire is then passed across the blockage . The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guidewire by gently twisting the end that sits outside the patient . While the guidewire is in place it acts as the pathway to and across the stenosis . An angioplasty balloon catheter, which is composed of a hollow tube, is inserted over the guidewire and is gently advanced forward until the deflated balloon is positioned across the blockage . Usually, after balloon dilatation a stent is inserted to eliminate the problem of elastic recoil of the treated lesion . Type of stent . Several randomized clinical trials, which included patients with STEMI, have shown that drug-eluting stents reduce the risk of re-intervention compared with bare-metal stents, without having a significant impact on the risk of stent thrombosis, recurrent MI or death . The femoral approach has been widely adopted for PCI in the past . However, the radial approach has been increasingly favored in recent years because of potentially important advantages, including lower risk of major vascular complications and major bleeding, reduced length of stay after the procedure, reduced use of resources, and possibly lower mortality in high-risk patients such as those with STEMI . Coronary artery bypass grafting . Approximately 10% of patients with acute coronary syndromes (STEMI and NSTEMI) undergo CABG during initial hospitalization (Figure 3.2) . CABG involves connecting, or grafting, a healthy artery (usually a mammary artery from the chest wall) directly to the coronary artery beyond the narrowing or blockage, or a vein to the coronary artery beyond the narrowing or blockage, and then connecting the vein to the aorta . Another potential artery used as a conduit is the radial artery . Single, double, triple, quadruple and quintuple (rare) bypasses can be made to a number of coronary arteries . For isolated CABG, the patient's heart is usually stopped and surgery is performed using cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross clamping and cardioplegic cardiac arrest (on-pump CABG) . CABG can also be performed on a beating heart using various stabilization devices to provide a motionless surgical field (off-pump CABG) . In general, off-pump CABG is not performed very frequently, unless there is heavy aortic calcification with a high risk of stroke associated with clamping . While avoidance of full-dose heparinization, potential hyperfibrinolysis and embolization of debris may reduce the incidence of CABG-related bleeding, particularly when performed during DAPT, stroke and postoperative respiratory complications, off-pump CABG may not be amenable to all stenotic lesions and may lead to repeat revascularizations or PCIs . 
All patients eventually become symptomatic as the disease progresses, due to bone marrow failure and increasing splenomegaly, which can lead to abdominal symptoms and early satiety . Aims of treatment . Depending on the clinical presentation, the aims of treatment for myelofibrosis are to . reduce anemia . reduce splenomegaly . alleviate systemic symptoms . As with ET and PV, the choice of treatment for patients with myelofibrosis depends on the level of risk . Risk stratification is essential in patients with myelofibrosis because the level of risk has a marked impact on the prognosis . Median survival in patients at the highest level of risk is approximately 2 years, compared with approximately 20 years in low-risk patients (Figure 6.1) . The MIPSS70-Plus also includes cytogenetic data, including the presence of two or more high-risk mutations . Conversely, approximately one-third of patients classified as low or intermediate-1 risk using the DIPSS-Plus are considered to be at high risk according to the MIPSS70-Plus . Splenomegaly resulting from extramedullary hematopoiesis is characteristic of myelofibrosis . However, all patients ultimately require treatment as the spleen continues to enlarge . Treatment options include cytoreductive therapy, splenectomy, radiation therapy and JAK inhibitors . Constitutional symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis are believed to result from altered cytokine production, and often respond to ruxolitinib or to the treatment of splenomegaly . The current standard of care - if treatment is required - is low-dose fractionated radiotherapy . In general, JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib are considered as first-line treatment for splenomegaly and symptoms in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis, and SCT is an option for high-risk patients with a poor prognosis . The efficacy and safety of the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis has been investigated in two large randomized placebo-controlled trials: COMFORT-I and -II . The decrease in spleen volume with ruxolitinib was associated with significant improvement in symptom scores and quality of life measures . Other JAK inhibitors . Three other JAK inhibitors have been evaluated in Phase III studies for the treatment of myelofibrosis (see Chapter 7) . fedratinib is a JAK2 inhibitor . Supportive therapy . The JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib have largely superseded hydroxyurea as the treatment of choice for symptomatic splenomegaly . However, about 80% of patients require an alternative treatment within approximately 1 year . Among the 17 patients with myelofibrosis, 12 (71%) showed partial remission, clinical improvement or stable disease, as assessed using the International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment criteria . Thus, the potential benefits and risks of splenectomy must be considered carefully and discussed with the patient . The NCCN guidelines for the management of myelofibrosis-associated anemia recommend the following . Entry into a clinical trial should be considered . However, anemia ultimately becomes refractory to treatment in the majority of patients, necessitating regular red blood cell transfusion . Treatment of blast phase myelofibrosis . Responses to chemotherapy can be achieved but are not durable; palliative treatment should therefore be considered . Monitoring treatment . Disease- and patient-related dimensions must be considered when monitoring response to treatment in patients with myelofibrosis . Monitoring JAK2 inhibitor therapy . Even though marked improvements in symptoms and health-related quality of life are seen with ruxolitinib, more than 50% of patients discontinue treatment within 2-3 years because of resistance (usually secondary; few patients having primary resistant disease), disease progression or intolerance . Splenomegaly and symptoms may recur rapidly after withdrawal of ruxolitinib, and sometimes aggressively (see page 72) . Patients who stop JAK inhibitors have a poor prognosis . Currently there is no consensus on the definition of treatment failure or suboptimal response in routine clinical practice . 
The classic presenting sign or symptom of a bladder tumor is painless gross or microscopic hematuria; it is the sole presenting symptom in 60-80% of patients . Unfortunately, and despite the well-known sinister implications of this finding, many patients who present with hematuria are not evaluated further or referred to a urologist . Up to 20% of patients with bladder cancer will not have hematuria at presentation . Other patterns of presentation also occur (Table 3.1) and are sometimes similarly unrecognized as an indication of serious underlying pathology . Magnetic resonance urography is an alternative for patients who cannot receive intravenous iodinated contrast . Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria . There is good correlation of 1+ or more dipstick hematuria with significant microscopic hematuria . Irritative symptoms . Irritative symptoms such as dysuria, increased frequency and urgency are often dismissed because they are common, are usually due to urinary tract infection (UTI) and are typically not associated with serious disease . However, if infection is absent or symptoms persist after the UTI has been treated, the possibility of an underlying bladder malignancy must be considered and the patient referred to a urologist . Irritative symptoms are particularly common in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), and suprapubic pain when the bladder is full can also be caused by carcinoma of the bladder . Urinalysis in patients with irritative symptoms due to CIS or invasive cancer will usually reveal the presence of red or white blood cells . Recurrent UTI is sometimes due to the presence of a bladder tumor . A single UTI in a man, or two or more in a woman, should be investigated; however, the likelihood of a malignant etiology is very low in patients under 50 years of age . Symptoms of local or distant spread . Patients sometimes present with systemic symptoms due to advanced carcinoma of the bladder . Loin pain can be caused by ureteric obstruction due to an invasive bladder tumor (Figure 3.1) . The pain is usually a dull ache in the costophrenic angle, and may or may not coincide with other symptoms such as hematuria . Occasionally, infection occurs in an obstructed system, giving rise to severe symptoms of pyelonephritis . Pleuritic chest pain may also be present . Anorexia, nausea, weight loss and malaise may result from renal failure due to bilateral ureteric obstruction, or from the systemic effects of the tumor itself . Bone pain or pathological fractures may result from skeletal metastases (Figure 3.3); the pain is unrelieved by rest and can be severe . Headache or disordered thought processes are uncommon as a presenting feature but may indicate underlying brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis . Delay in diagnosis . Delays may occur for a variety of reasons . Presentation by the patient may be delayed because of anxiety about the cause of the symptoms, fear of primary care physicians or hospitals or ignorance of the significance of symptoms . Referral by the primary care physician to a specialist may be delayed because of ignorance of the significance of the symptoms, or limited access to specialist healthcare (waiting times for clinic appointments) . Diagnosis by the specialist may be delayed because of waiting times for investigations, follow-up clinic appointments for results, or cystoscopy . Taken together, these factors mean that the average time from the first symptom to treatment of the bladder tumor varies from a few weeks to more than a year across studies . In an attempt to streamline the diagnosis and treatment of patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer, many hospitals now offer a hematuria clinic at which patients can be seen within a week of referral . This allows a diagnosis to be made and treatment planned expeditiously . It may be profuse (such that the patient describes passing pure blood) and contain clots or it may have only a slight pink discoloration . Clots that have been in the bladder for some time may impart a rusty color to the urine . Any patient with these symptoms should be referred to a urologist immediately . However, patients sometimes ignore a single episode of hematuria and do not seek advice until the bleeding recurs . Menstruating women may also sometimes confuse hematuria with menstrual flow . The resultant delay in diagnosis and treatment may make treatment more difficult and reduce the possibility of cure . 
Using gene therapy for polygenic traits would require the coincident targeting of more than one gene; the efficiency of this approach is likely to be too low to be therapeutic . Therefore, gene therapy is more applicable to monogenic diseases, where mutations are carried by a single gene; conditions caused by mutations that result in loss of protein expression and those caused by mutations that result in expression of a protein with altered function are amenable to gene therapy . Loss-of-function mutations . It is possible to use gene therapy to compensate for the defective gene in a number of ways . Replacement of a defective copy of a gene . Gene addition, where the coding DNA of the affected gene is delivered to cells or a tissue, theoretically provides a therapy that would be applicable to all patients with a disease, irrespective of the mutation they possess . The resulting repair can correct the disease-causing mutation in two distinct ways . Gain-of-function mutations . Gain-of-function mutations generally display autosomal dominant inheritance and result in the expression of proteins with altered function that cause disease . Gene therapies can be used to silence these mutations through a variety of mechanisms . RNA interference (RNAi) can lead to the highly specific targeted knockdown of expression of a disease gene . Targeting non-coding RNA . An siRNA targets a single gene, while an miRNA has multiple gene targets . Both bind the mRNA of target genes in a competitive manner . The delivery of an miRNA mimic to potentiate miRNA function will downregulate the target mRNA and so block the expression of a pathogenic gene . Endonucleases can be used to disrupt a gene carrying a gain-of-function mutation so that expression is inhibited . Complex diseases . As such, they do not lend themselves to gene therapy . Somatic versus germline gene therapy . The type of cells or tissues targeted using gene therapy determines whether therapy is somatic or germline . Somatic gene therapies are those that target any cell within a body except the reproductive cells . Such gene therapies are considered to be safer, as none of the genetic changes will be inherited by any offspring . Ex vivo application . Using hematopoietic stem cells . It is also possible to exploit HSC gene therapy to engineer the cells to increase the therapeutic gene dosage, to specifically target diseased tissues or to become resistant to particular disease-causing pathogens . Hepatocytes, another adult stem cell type, have also been used for autologous ex vivo gene therapies for certain liver diseases . The genetic manipulation of cells in culture may reduce the reconstitution potential of the infused cells . The technology is continually advancing, and highly efficient gene targeting and site-specific gene editing means that somatic gene disruption (for gain-of-function mutations), gene correction rather than gene replacement (for loss-of-function mutations) and targeted, rather than random, integration are now possible . The most advanced cellular gene therapy involves chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells . T-cell receptors recognize specific antigens on the surface of target cells and induce cell-specific killing . This target-cell-specific killing has been exploited to destroy tumor cells . T cells are a heterogeneous cell population that can be derived from HSCs and genetically manipulated ex vivo so that they express CARs and become tumor targeting . A CAR-T cell therapy that recognizes CD19, a B-cell surface antigen widely expressed in B-cell malignancies, is now an approved gene and cell therapy . In vivo gene therapy involves the direct administration of therapeutic agent, usually via a viral vector (see below), to resident cells of the target tissue . To be successful, the cells need to be easily but specifically targeted and the therapy should be efficacious and long lived . Certain tissues are easily targeted using in vivo gene therapy . It is possible to use tissue-specific promoters and/or regulatory elements to drive expression and engineer the tropism displayed by the viral vectors to direct the gene therapy to the disease-affected tissue . Delivery using non-viral vectors . Delivery using viral vectors . Choice of viral vector . mutation of the viral integrase gene to create integration-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) . The maximal therapeutic efficacy of a gene therapy is achieved through controlled targeted expression, with the avoidance of side effects associated with off-target and non-physiological expression . 
A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes changes the lives of affected patients for ever . The objectives of this strategy are to . maintain bodyweight . avoid hyperglycemic symptoms . delay or prevent the onset of complications of diabetes . prevent patients from developing diabetic ketoacidosis . However, this phenomenon has not been reported in the USA and the hypothesis has largely been patient driven . Only a few manufacturers continue to produce insulin derived from animals . No major world insulin producer continues to do so . The biphasic insulin analogs have an onset of action of 10-20 minutes and a duration of up to 24 hours . Table 6.1 lists some common insulin preparations . Delivery methods and injection sites . The usual sites recommended for insulin injection are illustrated in Figure 6.5 . This was reinforced by the experience of participants in the DCCT . Education is best delivered by a multidisciplinary team comprising dietitians, diabetes nurse educators and diabetologists . This evidence-based program is now being delivered with good results by accredited DAFNE training centers in many European countries . Education methods should include open access, support, encouragement, motivational strategies and coping-oriented techniques . Strategies for improving adherence and thus optimizing self-management are discussed further in Chapter 7, Strategies to improve adherence to recommendations . Insulin pumps . Insulin pumps have long been available to treat type 1 diabetes . Mechanism of action . The individual wears a small portable battery-driven pump (Figure 6.6) with a reservoir of rapidly acting insulin . This needs to be re-sited every 1-2 days to avoid local inflammation . Such teams need to be available to offer telephone advice on a 24-hour basis in case of problems . CSII is generally associated with lower rates of hypoglycemic episodes . Skin complications are encountered occasionally . CSII usage varies greatly between countries in the developed world . Insulin allergy . Such reactions usually respond to switching to a different insulin preparation . Needle phobia . They are not in common usage . This device may be particularly helpful for use with young children . Now, about 1200 pancreas transplants are undertaken annually in the USA . At the beginning of 2011, the total number of pancreas transplants performed worldwide was close to 40 000 . The success achieved with these procedures reflects improved surgical techniques and advances in immunosuppressive therapy . SPK remains a very useful treatment strategy for those patients with end-stage kidney disease . As for other transplants, the shortage of donor organs remains a significant problem . Islet cell transplantation . The Edmonton workers reported a 1-year rate of sustained insulin independence of 85% . Repeat islet infusions were necessary in the majority of patients . The most frequent complication was bleeding, either intraperitoneal or liver subcapsular, with an incidence as high as 13% . The second most frequent complication was partial portal vein thrombosis (< 5% of cases) . Self-monitoring of blood glucose . This is delivered on to a measuring strip that is then inserted into the meter for measurement . Frequency and timing . Suggestions include . two readings per day with variation of the timing of readings on alternate days . four readings per day . an intensive profile of four or more readings per day on selected days during the week . Patients using less frequent injections could test less often, as suggested above . Occasionally, in some patients, blood testing can become excessive, obsessive and hence counterproductive . Occasional testing during the night can be helpful to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia . Pregnant patients are often advised to check 1 hour after meals in some national guidelines . The future . Testing for ketones . Ketone testing is also very useful in young children . The more glucose in the circulation, the greater the production of glycated hemoglobin . Similarly, spurious results may be obtained in patients with a hemoglobinopathy . HbA 1c results have traditionally been reported as a percentage of total hemoglobin . However, thus far, this system of reporting has not been universally adopted . However, other professional bodies recommend different targets . 
Symptoms of congestion should be managed with diuretics (see pages 95 -) . General management principles . Knowledge of LV and RV function is essential to the application of medical therapy . First-line therapy . Oral diuretics . In mild and stable forms of HF, the oral route should be used first . Loop diuretics and thiazides are prescribed most frequently (Table 7.1) . Loop diuretics act on the ascending loop of Henle in the kidney . Dose escalation and addition of a thiazide diuretic may be required if the edema is resistant . Daily weight monitoring and frequent electrolyte measurement should be employed in such cases, with prompt replacement of potassium when required . Acetazolamide is a weak diuretic designed to block tissue carbonic anhydrase . The effect is to lower serum pH; high dosing may result in metabolic acidosis . The drug is used infrequently, mainly in patients with metabolic alkalosis . Parenteral diuretics . Furosemide can be administered by continuous infusion or boluses . Peak diuresis should be achieved within 2 hours and last for 6-8 hours . General monitoring includes daily weight and serum electrolytes, and large or rapid weight losses should be avoided . Developments in this area are discussed on pages 145 . This causes vasodilation and decreases intraglomerular pressure . If target doses are not reached (poorly tolerated), then lower doses are still beneficial . Absolute and relative contraindications and drug interactions are shown in Table 7.3 . There is no convincing evidence for the use of ACE inhibitors in HFpEF . CONSENSUS I reported on survival at 10 years . Other trials . Absolute and relative contraindications and drug interactions are shown in Table 7.5 . Mean follow-up was 23 months . Beta-blockers . Contraindications and drug interactions are shown in Table 7.7 . The trial was stopped early as bisoprolol showed significant mortality benefit . These patients were treated with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) . Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (normal systolic function) . Systolic heart failure and diabetes mellitus . The incidence of adverse effects appeared to be similar in the two groups . Systolic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . However, dose escalation leads to loss of selectivity and a potential risk of bronchospasm . Systolic heart failure and end-stage renal disease . Systolic left-sided heart failure in the elderly . Contraindications and drug interactions are shown in Table 7.9 . Second-line therapy . Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) . It increases the concentration of vasodilatory peptides, augments sodium loss and retards hypertrophy and remodeling . NYHA class II-IV . The study excluded patients with . hypotension (symptomatic, systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg) . eGFR < 30 mL/minute . potassium level > 5.2 mmol/L . history of angioedema . Side effects . Heart rate reduction . Ivabradine is a selective inhibitor of a sodium-potassium channel highly expressed in the sinoatrial node . Its pharmacological actions lead to a slowing of the heart rate in patients with preserved sinus rhythm . Iron replacement in iron-deficient patients . Screening for and diagnosing iron deficiency is recommended in all newly diagnosed patients with systolic HF . A dose of 1 g daily of almost pure omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid or equivalent is recommended . Beware of drug toxicity, mainly in patients with renal dysfunction . Common side effects include nausea and anorexia; these can develop even if the serum level is within the therapeutic range . Other therapies . This finding merits further evaluation in a large multicenter study . Inotropic agents . Treatment of acute heart failure . Otherwise, beta-blocker therapy should continue . 
Up to 80% of people with asthma will develop exercise-induced symptoms, so that exercise for some people is a real trigger for their asthma . Indeed, in some people asthma is only evident on exercising; this is particularly the case for children, in whom the benefits of exercise are especially important . Consequently, managing exercise-induced asthma and enabling individuals to exercise despite asthma is an important part of asthma management . Optimizing asthma diagnosis and treatment in elite athletes is critical to optimizing performance and deserves particular attention . Exercise-induced asthma is defined as a transient increase in airway resistance that follows vigorous exercise . Many people complain of shortness of breath while exercising, and this symptom is often magnified in people with asthma . Exercise-induced asthma is particularly common in children and approximately 80% of children with asthma will have evidence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction . For some individuals with brittle asthma, the response to exercise can be severe and may be a strong disincentive to exercise . Thus, individuals who experience a bout of exercise-induced asthma can undertake subsequent exercise with relative protection from further episodes . Some people with asthma use this strategy to manage exercise-induced symptoms by undertaking a warm-up to exercise of short, high-intensity exercise bursts . For most, exercise-induced asthma can be diagnosed on symptoms or wheeze or excess dyspnea during or following exercise, which may be confirmed with peak flow testing . In addition, breathing humidified warmed air during exercise has been shown to be protective for the development of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction . By contrast, many individuals with asthma find cold air a potent trigger of symptoms . Airway challenge for the diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma . The problem with laboratory exercise tests is that they may not replicate the environmental conditions under which exercise is performed . In addition, it is often difficult to achieve adequately high workloads for very fit individuals, such as athletes, using laboratory exercise equipment . As a consequence of these difficulties, surrogate challenges for exercise-induced asthma have been developed so that a diagnosis can be consistently achieved . Exercise challenge testing is an indirect challenge relying on airway responses to exercise, such as airway drying and cooling, to cause smooth muscle contraction . Because of the difficulties of replicating field exercise in the laboratory to achieve consistency of diagnosis, a number of surrogate challenges for exercise have been developed . This surrogate challenge has been shown to correlate very well with actual exercise challenge and is suitable for use by athletes . These agents mimic the dehydration of the airways that is probably responsible for exercise-induced asthma . Direct challenges . It is therefore important not to exclude exercise-induced asthma on the basis of a negative direct airway challenge test result . Exercise-induced asthma in athletes . The high prevalence of exercise-induced asthma in elite athletes has been an issue of concern . Some elite cold-weather athletes, such as cross-country skiers, are very likely to develop exercise-induced asthma (so called 'skier's asthma') . In summer athletes, a high occurrence of asthma has been reported in elite swimmers . The finding that older athletes and those from sports that are predominantly aerobic are more likely to have exercise-induced asthma supports this theory . Investigation of symptoms of elite athletes revealed that traditional asthma symptoms have a sensitivity of only 60% in predicting exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in laboratory challenge . Thus, poor performance in an athlete ought to prompt consideration of exercise-induced asthma . The diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma in elite athletes must be verified by airway challenges . Treatment for exercise-induced asthma in those with pre-existing asthma is determined by evaluating lung function and symptoms . Individuals with lung function abnormalities and symptoms of asthma both with and without exercise should have the usual controller (preventer) medication prescribed . However, many people with asthma do have asthma symptoms despite regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and may require additional short-acting beta -agonists (SABAs) before exercise to prevent exercise-induced asthma . Some individuals with normal interval lung function complain of symptoms only on exercise . Non-drug strategies for the treatment of exercise-induced asthma rely on the refractory period that follows induction of airway narrowing with exercise . It is frequently recommended that athletes with exercise-induced asthma warm up slowly . They may institute strategies such as repeated high-intensity runs during a warm-up to prevent exercise-induced asthma occurring in the main competition . 
A 'Trap' is a cytokine inhibitor that uses different high-affinity receptor components to bind the target ligand . A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to IL-1 (canakinumab) is also being tested as a therapy for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . IL-17, first described in 1995, is an attractive target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), though it has been less studied than many of the previously described cytokines . It has pro-inflammatory activity and may be important early in the inflammatory response (see also Chapter 3) . Clinical trials of anti-IL-17 mAbs will determine whether IL-17 inhibition will be as effective as other cytokine inhibitors . Inflammatory and destructive responses require appropriate gene activation . In turn, these genes are activated through cascades of signaling molecules . Janus kinase inhibitors . JAK3 plays a crucial role in regulating leukocyte function, becoming activated following IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor . Clinical trials of JAK inhibitors in patients with RA have yielded encouraging results, both from efficacy and toxicity standpoints . These are chemically synthesized orally bioavailable drugs, which provides a potential advantage over biological therapies . All three of these pathways are of potential pathogenic significance in RA and an orally bioavailable SYK inhibitor is being studied in RA, with encouraging results to date . Gene therapy . Some of the biological therapies, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), are limited by an extremely short half-life . Gene therapy provides a potential means of overcoming the requirement for daily injections . Advances in surgery . Although reconstructive surgery has been one of the major advances for improving the quality of life of many RA patients, there are limitations; these include loosening of the prosthetic joints and inadequate prosthetic replacements for several joints (exempli gratia ankle, shoulder) . A large body of knowledge is accumulating concerning prosthetic joint loosening, which should result in the development of techniques and strategies to prolong the life of artificial joints . Therapeutic tolerance . Translation to the clinic has been slow, but over recent years there have been major advances both in the application of tolerogenic therapies, and in their monitoring . A number of cellular therapies are also being developed as potential tolerogenic agents . These include purified and expanded regulatory T cells, tolerogenic dendritic cells and mesenchymal stem cells which, in addition to their tissue engineering potential (see below), also have powerful immunomodulatory properties . Stem cell biology . Rapid advances are being made in the isolation, expansion and culture of these cells, which could result in the generation of 'replacement parts' for joints in the laboratory . Although such technology is likely to be applied initially to osteoarthritic joints, a role in RA may become evident, particularly if mesenchymal defects are shown to play a primary role in disease pathogenesis . Pre-RA . Chapter 2 highlighted that circulating autoantibodies appear many years before the onset of RA symptoms . Imaging studies have also indicated that synovitis can be present in joints for weeks to months before symptoms occur . Clinical trials of many therapies have demonstrated optimal results in early disease and attention is starting to turn to the preclinical phase of RA for two reasons . First, the likelihood of switching off disease and obtaining long-term remission, for example using tolerogenic therapies (see above), appears much higher before disease becomes established . Second, if it were possible to identify individuals with a high likelihood of developing RA, it may be possible to institute preventive measures . The sequencing of the human genome has led to huge advances in understanding the genetics of diseases such as RA (see Chapter 2) . These include DNA silencing by methylation, and transcriptional modification of genes by histone acetylation . Another important influence comes from microRNAs, which are genome-encoded small RNA molecules that influence the transcription and translation of genes . A number of important epigenetic modifications have been linked to human disease and, importantly, these processes are readily targetable . Aspects of the RA pathogenic process attributable to epigenetic modification have already been modulated in vitro and drugs that target epigenetic processes will soon be developed for RA . Therapeutic developments . Numerous novel potential targets for biological as well as oral therapies are currently under investigation . 
Furthermore, weight-loss criteria are problematic for those patients who begin dieting at above-average weights and so are required to persist in weight-losing behaviors for longer before meeting diagnostic criteria . Measuring weight . Accurate weight measurements are important when diagnosing an eating disorder . An adolescent patient who initially showed normal growth might stop gaining weight or might lose weight while height continues to increase . Standard procedures must be followed to record consistent reliable measurements of weight . Scales should be located in a private area, and any comments about the patient's weight should be discreet and kept to a minimum . Signs and symptoms . Medical causes of weight loss other than eating disorders are . Behavioral signs associated with anorexia are shown in Table 4.4 . Physical signs . The typical presenting signs and symptoms are shown in Table 4.5 . The typical patient with bulimia is within the normal weight range for age and height . Behavioral signs associated with bulimia are shown in Table 4.6 . Physical signs . Medical complications include . gastrointestinal disorders or bleeding . These complications are generally more dangerous in patients who are underweight . Particular signs of an eating disorder in this population include . weight loss . The prevalence of eating disorders in female athletes is especially high . disordered eating . Although these are common symptoms and behavioral indicators of eating disorders, most female athletes do not meet the standard criteria for anorexia or bulimia . Additionally, weight loss may be induced by comments and unrealistic demands for weight loss by coaches, particularly in aesthetic sports . Diagnosis in men . Men with eating disorders are less likely than women to seek professional help, as eating disorders are commonly viewed as a 'woman's disease' . However, the number of men seeking treatment for an eating disorder may be increasing . The most common diagnosis of eating disorders among men is 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' (EDNOS) . Notably, men with an eating disorder - particularly bulimia or binge-eating disorder - may be more likely to have a substance-abuse problem . When questioned effectively, men with eating disorders will report . A significant yet undocumented proportion of patients with eating disorders have a history of being overweight . body dissatisfaction experienced by these patients is usually reinforced by the encouragement of weight-loss behaviors, even if these are unhealthy . Physicians should actively screen obese patients for eating disorders, and should encourage healthy eating practices, gradual weight loss and moderation in prescribed lifestyle changes (see Fast Facts: Obesity) . Along with the diagnostic purging behaviors, diabetic patients may also reduce their insulin doses in attempts to control their weight . A large sample of mixed adults and adolescents from such a clinic found that about 63% of all patients with an eating disorder had experienced an affective disorder at some time . obsessive-compulsive disorder . borderline personality disorder (more common in bulimia) . The assessment of eating disorders remains a complex clinical task, because the disorders present as a mix of disturbances in multiple domains with overlapping symptoms . Structured interviews enable the reliable and valid assessment of the key behavioral features and associated psychopathology of eating disorders . The main screening tools for assessment of eating disorders are shown in Table 4.8 . After ensuring that the patient's weight loss is not due to a medical condition, the major considerations are . psychotic disorder involving paranoid or delusional beliefs regarding eating or weight . obsessive-compulsive disorder involving rituals about food and weight that are undesired or in conflict with the patient's self-perception . Careful interview of the patient, family members and other clinicians may be required to clarify the diagnosis . The most common differential diagnoses of bulimia are . binge-eating disorder . gastrointestinal disorders . Anorexia may also involve bingeing and purging, but not as consistently as bulimia . Patients with anorexia must be at least 15% below the expected bodyweight, whereas there is often weight fluctuation and no recognizable weight loss in patients with bulimia . It is therefore important to question both the patient and the parents . Additionally, clinical assessment over time is important to better understand the nature of the patient's symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment approach . Questions to ask the patient and parents to aid diagnosis are listed in Table 4.1 . 
Clinical presentation . There are three principal clinical presentations of UA/NSTEMI . new-onset severe angina - present for less than 2 months . The causes of UA/NSTEMI are shown in Table 4.2 . Some patients can have two or more causes . General management principles . relieving angina and improving myocardial perfusion . preventing thrombosis propagation . stabilizing the vulnerable plaque . Conservative versus invasive treatment . Otherwise, the decision is based upon an assessment of risk (see Chapter 2) . Assessment of left ventricular function . When heart failure or diabetes mellitus is present, aldosterone antagonists are indicated . Invasive treatment . Bleeding risk . Antithrombotic therapy . Antiplatelet therapy . These pivotal findings form the basis for current therapeutic recommendations in ACS . Mechanism of action . The optimal dose for NSTE-ACS is controversial . Intravenous administration is also recommended in European countries . Side effects . Although highlighted by regulators, the clinical importance of this pharmacodynamic interaction remains highly controversial . The benefit of prasugrel was mainly driven by a reduction in MIs . When possible, prasugrel should be discontinued at least 7 days before any surgery . Elinogrel is a direct-acting reversible P2Y receptor antagonist . The development of elinogrel has been stopped recently because of unfavorable efficacy and adverse side effects . Thrombin receptor antagonists . Two major PAR-1 blockers have been studied: vorapaxar and atopaxar . The development of atopaxar has been stopped recently due to lack of significant benefits . Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors . Recommended dosing is shown in Table 4.5 . Clinial trial results . Major anticoagulants used in the treatment of NSTE-ACS are . direct thrombin inhibitors - dabigatran and bivalirudin . Indirect thrombin and Xa inhibitors . Unfractionated heparin is a heterogeneous mixture of polysaccharide molecules . UH binds plasma protein strongly, leading to unpredictable levels of free heparin in the circulation . LMWHs are divergent agents and cannot be compared on a 1:1 basis . To date, the best investigated LMWH in cardiology is enoxaparin . The latter functions are responsible for the amplification of thrombin generation . They have limited interaction with plasma proteins, making dosing and bioavailability much more predictable . Apixaban is an oral, selective, reversible and direct factor Xa inhibitor . Anticoagulant regimens . Recent recommendations ask for a prolongation of infusion until 4 hours after the intervention . Non-antithrombotic therapy . Bed chair/rest is recommended, with continuous ECG monitoring . Pulse oximetry is useful for continuous measurement of oxygen saturation . Afterload reduction is more modestly reduced . The reduction in preload and afterload contributes to reduced myocardial oxygen demand . Nitroglycerin also dilates major epicardial coronary arteries and enhances flow in collateral vessels . Beta-blockers . Myocardial and collateral flows improve due to prolongation of diastolic time . Beta-blockers exert beneficial effects in all forms of CAD . In general, the recommendation is to start with oral therapy . Calcium-channel blockers . dihydropyridines (nifedipine, amlodipine) . benzothiazepines (diltiazem) . phenylalkylamines (verapamil) . The elderly . Atypical presentation, including dyspnea or symptoms of heart failure, is more common in women . Patients with diabetes mellitus . aggressive glycemic control . early invasive strategy in patients with single-vessel disease . Patients with chronic kidney disease . Renal dysfunction is a major risk factor for the development and progression of cardiovascular disease . 
The clinical assessment of a patient with double vision (diplopia) is complex, and it is very difficult for non-ophthalmologists to accurately differentiate between serious and non-serious causes . For this reason, all patients with new-onset transient or persisting double vision require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist, ideally to be seen the same day . Causes of double vision . If a patient has double vision they see two images of a single object . Many adults with double vision have an ischemic third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy, which will usually resolve spontaneously within a few months . New-onset double vision is also a common presenting symptom of potentially fatal brain aneurysms, brain tumors, stroke, myasthenia gravis or temporal arteritis . Brain aneurysms in particular can rupture, causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and may kill the patient within hours of the onset of double vision if they are not immediately diagnosed and treated . As outlined in the following sections, double vision can result from disease of the orbit, extraocular muscles, neuromuscular junction, ocular motor nerves or brain . Orbit and extraocular muscle disease . Orbital fractures may cause diplopia by entrapment of, or damage to, the eye muscles . Thyroid eye disease causes swelling of the extraocular muscles and orbital connective tissue, pushing the eyeball forward (proptosis) and often causing restricted movement of the eye along with diplopia (Figure 4.1) . The eye muscles are also less commonly affected by infection or autoimmune inflammation of other causes . Orbital tumors may also present with diplopia . Neuromuscular junction disease (myasthenia gravis) is a relatively common cause of diplopia and/or ptosis (drooping upper eyelid/s) in adults of all ages . Most patients with myasthenia say that their double vision varies from day to day, and is often worst at the end of the day . The most common cause of diplopia in patients over 50 is an ischemic third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy; this is usually due to diabetes or atherosclerosis . Another important cause in this age group, which should be excluded, is temporal arteritis . Partial third nerve palsy may not be obvious, as it can present as a subtle vertical muscle imbalance (one eye higher than the other) or one eye turned out with horizontal, vertical or oblique double vision . Posterior communicating artery aneurysm causes up to a third of all third nerve palsies (partial or complete) . The most common cause overall of third nerve palsy is ischemia . The palsy causes superior oblique weakness, resulting in the affected eye being higher than the unaffected eye . Initially, the eye also rotates outwards, causing a torsional double vision . This is corrected by the patient who unknowingly tilts the head in the opposite direction to prevent the diplopia . Fourth cranial nerve palsy may be congenital, and often presents as head tilt in children . Ischemia is also a common cause of fourth nerve palsy . It can also be caused, rarely, by a brain tumor . The palsy causes lateral rectus weakness; the eye turns in and cannot turn out fully towards the ear (Figure 4.3), which results in horizontal double vision . Common causes include ischemia (atherosclerosis, diabetes or temporal arteritis); less common causes include raised intracranial pressure and brain tumors . Brain disease . Brain tumors may cause third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy (see above) . Disease of higher brain centers can also cause complicated eye movement disorders . Temporal arteritis is a sight- and life-threatening disease that only affects patients over 50 . It is not uncommon for the patient to complain of intermittent double vision that has disappeared by the time they see a doctor (with a normal eye examination) . Alternatively, they may present with a third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy . Urgent referral may save the patient's sight or their life . Double vision after trauma . Causes of double vision after eye or head trauma include orbital fractures or bruising; third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy due to the initial head trauma or secondary to an expanding intracranial hemorrhage; or brain damage causing an eye movement disorder . 
Philip Mease . Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and vary widely in severity . The disease is underdiagnosed and often undertreated . It is therefore important for a correct diagnosis to be reached promptly . History and classification . An association between psoriasis and a form of inflammatory arthritis was first suggested in the 1850s . Clinical manifestations . Men and women are equally affected . These changes may be chronic, or may wax and wane . At this stage, it is more common for individuals to experience disability and deforming changes of the joints (Figure 9.2) . Rarely, such non-articular involvement will be the only manifestation of psoriatic arthritis . Non-musculoskeletal inflammatory symptoms may also appear episodically, including uveitis or inflammatory bowel disorder . Radiographic and laboratory features . Blood testing for rheumatoid factor is usually, although not invariably, negative . In juvenile psoriatic arthritis, which is rare, tests for antinuclear antibodies may prove positive . This is often frustrating for the clinician and patient alike as diagnostic confirmation is sought . It is generally accepted that the prevalence of psoriasis falls between 2% and 3% in the North American and European populations . Lower percentages are suggested when a simple community survey or patient chart review is carried out . There is a strong familial tendency for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . Patients with HLA-B27 are more likely to have spine manifestations . These prominently include tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, interleukin (IL)-17 and others . These agents have yielded significant advances in the effective treatment of symptoms and signs of both arthritis and enthesitis . Indications for systemic therapy . It is therefore important to determine an appropriate therapeutic strategy that takes into account patient and disease characteristics . the patient is unable to pursue activities of daily living, work or recreation relatively easily . the ESR and/or CRP levels are elevated . many joints are involved . there is radiographic evidence of erosions . Disease-modifying agents . Current dose regimens are 15-25 mg/week, with monitoring of complete blood count and liver function tests every 8-12 weeks . Symptomatic side effects include nausea and, rarely, diarrhea and hair loss . An extremely rare side effect is acute interstitial lung disease . Side effects are minimal and include rare gastrointestinal discomfort and diarrhea . Furthermore, side effects of hypertension and renal insufficiency limit its dosing and duration of use . Side effects with this drug are usually minimal . Periodic ophthalmological examination is suggested because of the extremely rare potential for retinopathy . There is also a risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis as well as other side effects associated with chronic use . Receptor-targeted therapies . Anti-TNF agents . etanercept is given in a dose of 50 mg subcutaneously weekly . infliximab is administered in an induction regimen of three infusions of 5 mg/kg over 6 weeks followed by maintenance infusions every 2 months . adalimumab is given in a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every other week . golimumab is dosed at 50 mg once a month subcutaneously . certolizumab pegol may be administered as 200 mg every 2 weeks or 400 mg every 4 weeks subcutaneously . These agents work quickly as well as effectively in most patients . All of these agents have shown durability of effectiveness over 2 years in clinical trials . Risk profile . The safety profile is similar to that seen in psoriasis, for example the rare potential for serious infection . The approved dose is 30 mg twice daily . The safety profile was good, showing a paucity of serious adverse events . A proportion of patients may experience nausea, diarrhea and headache . Interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors . IL-17 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by Th17 cells in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis . The safety profile of these agents is promising . Treatment approaches . Rheumatology-dermatology teamwork . These physicians therefore have a unique opportunity to recognize joint disease and potentially initiate treatment . 
Barriers to CINV prevention and control . Despite clear international guidelines on the optimal use of antiemetic regimens for the prevention and control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), these symptoms are still estimated to affect 35-50% of patients who undergo chemotherapy even with the use of effective antiemetic agents . Several issues continue to limit the effectiveness of CINV prevention and management . underestimation of the incidence of CINV by healthcare professionals and/or the effect it has on patients' quality of life . concerns about the adverse effects and/or costs of antiemetic treatments . lack of monitoring of patients in the 5 days immediately following chemotherapy . under-reporting of the incidence of CINV by patients . poor adherence to prescribed antiemetic medications . Underestimating incidence and effect . A recent multinational European survey, aimed at verifying the incidence of CINV and the corresponding antiemetic treatment patterns, showed there is a perceptual gap between patients and physicians/oncology nurses, particularly in terms of the occurrence of nausea and the impact CINV has on patients' quality of life . In total, 947 individuals (375 physicians, 186 oncology nurses and 386 patients) participated in the survey . Sixty percent of patients reported experiencing nausea only, 14% reported nausea and vomiting, and 4% reported vomiting only . Nausea without vomiting has only recently been thought of as a condition in its own right, and as such the incidence of nausea may often be underestimated . Although, in this survey, the physicians and oncology nurses overestimated the incidence of CINV, they underestimated its effect on patients' quality of life . Prescribing concerns . In total, 76% of the physicians in the European survey described above prescribed guideline-directed CINV prophylaxis for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) . This decreased to 15% for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), while 86% prescribed no or minimal antiemetic medication for patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy . Adverse effects and costs were cited as key factors in their reluctance to prescribe prophylactic CINV medication . Lack of follow-up . No patient monitoring in the 5-day period following chemotherapy was reported by 27% of physicians and 33% of oncology nurses, and was confirmed by half of the patients . Under-reporting by patients . The main reason for not reporting CINV in the European survey was a general perception by 51% of patients that nausea and vomiting is an inevitable consequence of chemotherapy that had to be tolerated . Only 38% of patients in the European survey reported full adherence to the guidelines given to them by their physicians/oncology nurses when self-administering antiemetic medication . Opportunties for improving CINV prevention and control . There are a number of institutional or clinic operational procedures that may address the issues above, and improve the quality of care of patients receiving chemotherapy . Better prescribing . Studies have shown that oncology nurses and nurse practitioners can have a key role in influencing the selection of the antiemetic regimen, and it is important that they are aware of the latest antiemetic guidelines and the factors that put patients at risk for CINV . Patient education . Clinicians should reassure patients that the incidence or severity of CINV is not an indicator of the effectiveness of their chemotherapy and that nausea and vomiting should not be considered a normal part of treatment . Furthermore, it is important to discuss the likelihood and management of adverse effects of antiemetic treatment and emphasize the importance of continuing the medications at home and completing the full course of treatment . Minimizing the pill burden and eliminating the requirement to swallow medication can also improve patient adherence to treatment . Improved follow-up . It is important to assess symptoms throughout therapy, as patient response to antiemetic treatment may change over time and may require adjustment of the antiemetic regimen . Telephone follow-up by oncology nurses with patients 24-48 hours after chemotherapy will provide important patient information as well as suggested treatment for unreported breakthrough CINV . At present, olanzapine appears to be the only current effective agent for the control of nausea (see Chapter 6) . Given the high incidence of nausea only experienced by patients, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of nausea and new approaches to its treatment are required . 
The driving T-cell population in psoriatic lesions is activated memory effector T cells . To reach the effector state, T cells must first be activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) . non-specific reversible binding of the T cell to the APC through interactions of surface molecules on the two cells . recognition of the major histocompatibility complex molecule on the APC by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor . Once the T cells have been activated by the APC, they enter the bloodstream and migrate back to the skin . This migration is achieved by the binding of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA1) complex on the T cells to an intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) on an endothelial cell in the cutaneous vasculature . Initial skin activation is required for APCs to migrate from the skin and interact with T cells (proinflammatory state) . Similarly, chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines are needed for T cells to enter the skin . These chemokines and cytokines are derived from endogenous skin cells (exempli gratia dendritic cells, macrophages, keratinocytes) as well as recruited cells . As specific details of the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis have been elucidated, new therapies have been developed that target the aberrant immune cells and molecules that trigger the development of psoriatic plaques . Receptor-targeted therapies have been in clinical studies and usage for a wide range of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders since 1997, but for psoriasis since 2003 . They are designed specifically to interfere with T-cell activation and effector function in order to prevent the inflammatory effects characteristic of this group of diseases . There are several important factors to consider before starting biological therapy (Table 8.1); for example, many of these drugs are also effective in treating psoriatic arthritis, a debilitating inflammatory arthritis that affects around 30% of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriatic skin disease (see Chapter 9) . Receptor-targeted therapies (or 'biologics') are proteins derived from recombinant DNA technology, hybridomas, blood and whole human cells . Three main types of biologics are used to treat inflammatory diseases . Receptor-targeted therapies are large molecules and administration is via injection or infusion . Several new oral agents for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are in the pipeline . Strategies to treat psoriasis . There are four major ways in which the various biologics are active against psoriasis (Table 8.2) . elimination of pathogenic T cells . blockade of T-cell activation/costimulation/migration . alteration of T-cell proliferative signals/immune deviation . Elimination of pathogenic T cells . This agent eliminated pathogenic T cells by binding to CD2 on T cells to block costimulation by LFA3 on APCs (see Figure 8.1) . Blockade of T-cell activation/costimulation/migration . The LFA1-ICAM1 interaction is also involved in T-cell migration into inflamed tissue, and was a second mechanism of action against psoriasis for this drug . There is increasing evidence that IL-17 is also a desirable therapeutic target for psoriasis treatment . Role of receptor-targeted therapies . Receptor-targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis since their introduction in 2003 . On the contrary, it is likely that they may help ameliorate the cardiovascular inflammatory component of the disease as well as the skin and joint inflammation, and therefore potentially reduce cardiovascular events in the psoriasis population . Pharmacogenomics in the future will hopefully allow for more precise targeting of individual drugs for individual patients, singly or in combination . While the goal for patients is long-term disease-free remissions and improved quality of life, overall cost and long-term safety will be key issues in determining the significance of biological therapies in the treatment of psoriasis . As the three TNFalpha agents lose patent protection, these biosimilar drugs are likely to ensure that more psoriasis patients are exposed to less expensive, equally safe and efficacious agents . A host of other key proinflammatory cytokine blockers for the treatment of psoriasis are currently in early phase development (Table 8.3) . 
VWF is synthesized in endothelial cells as a polypeptide of 2813 amino acids . It undergoes initial dimerization and then multimerization to a large protein with a molecular weight of 20 million Da . The higher-molecular-weight multimers are functionally more effective in promoting platelet adhesion and aggregation . VWF protein is synthesized by endothelial cells and released into the plasma . It is also stored in endothelial cell Weibel-Palade bodies, from which it can be released by vigorous exercise, desmopressin and adrenergic stimulation . Bone marrow megakaryocytes synthesize VWF, which is packaged into the developing platelet alpha-granules . The mature VWF protein possesses a number of specific binding sites that are receptors for its functional ligands (Figure 7.1) . Clinical features . Most patients present as young adults with menorrhagia or with a history of prolonged or excessive bleeding after dental surgery . Von Willebrand disease is usually a dominantly inherited condition of variable expression and penetrance . Ristocetin was originally developed as an antibiotic, but it caused thrombocytopenia . To establish a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease many of the tests in Table 7.1 are required . The diagnosis may not be straightforward as the level of one or more of the activities of the FVIII/VWF complex may be borderline or even normal . It is often necessary to repeat the estimations on at least three occasions, as the concentrations of both proteins are influenced by a number of endogenous factors such as pregnancy, oral contraceptives and intercurrent illness . The levels of FVIII and VWF are related to blood group . Often, referral to a specialized center is needed for additional tests to clarify the diagnosis, including collagen binding assay, platelet VWF studies and DNA sequencing of the VWF gene . In this situation, platelet function should be evaluated (see Chapter 4) . The various abnormalities in VWF have been classified into several subtypes (Table 7.2) . Type 1 accounts for 80% of cases . Type 2A: a loss of high-molecular weight-multimers . In this subtype, platelet aggregation is enhanced when ristocetin in added to the patient's platelet-rich plasma . The condition phenotypically resembles mild hemophilia A, because all the commonly measured VWF activities are normal . It can only be diagnosed by measuring FVIII binding to the patient's VWF in vitro . A further differentiating factor from hemophilia is that type 2N is inherited as a recessive trait, whereas inheritance is X-linked in hemophilia . Acquired von Willebrand syndrome . This may arise in association with a lymphoproliferative monoclonal gammopathy, hypothyroidism or aortic stenosis . Treatment should be directed at the underlying disorder . Plasmapheresis - by removing the intravascular paraprotein - can, in the short term, restore normal hemostasis to cover surgery . Combining desmopressin with tranexamic acid enhances hemostasis (see Chapter 5) . Desmopressin is generally indicated for the treatment of minor bleeding and as prophylaxis for minor surgery . Menorrhagia can often be controlled with combined oral contraceptives . Desmopressin is therefore contraindicated in type 2B . In type 3, desmopressin is clinically ineffective, as any response is modest and short lived . Treatment with a concentrate containing VWF is necessary for patients with major bleeding or about to undergo major surgery . Sufficient VWF should be infused so that levels of 100% are achieved and maintained for 7-10 days . Concentrates are also indicated for those who do not respond adequately to desmopressin or in whom its use is contraindicated (see Table 7.3) . After infusion of a concentrate containing both VWF and FVIII, the response should be assessed by measuring VWF:RCo activity and FVIII concentration . All currently approved concentrates are derived from plasma, but as a viral inactivation step is included in their manufacture they are safe from hepatitis viruses and HIV . There is still a small risk, however, of parvovirus infection . Recombinant VWF concentrations are currently undergoing clinical evaluation . 
Safety data for a biosimilar are likely to be limited at the time of launch . However, experience to date indicates that the adverse event profiles of biosimilars match those of their originators . Indeed, safety monitoring within the European Union (EU) since the introduction of biosimilars has not identified any relevant difference in the nature, severity or frequency of adverse effects between biosimilars and their reference medicines . The comparability studies performed on biosimilars mean that the risk of new or severe adverse events (type 2) is likely to be lower than with a novel biological agent . Immunogenicity is a potential safety concern with any biological agent, and even slight changes in structural properties or impurities could, in theory, trigger an adverse immune reaction . This is not only a direct safety issue, but underlies the anxieties over biosimilar brand switching, as differences in anti-drug antibody levels between two drug brands, or between different manufacturing process variants of the same brand, could create a loss of drug efficacy after switching . Product drift over time and evolution through manufacturing changes may produce structural differences in a reference biologic, meaning that no biologic can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . Immunogenicity cannot yet be predicted from analytic or animal studies with sufficient accuracy for biological medicines . Regulators are keen to identify differences in toxic potential such as acute anaphylaxis or reductions in efficacy through the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies that increase the clearance of the drug . Immunogenicity is monitored both pre- and postmarketing . Biosimilars do not have to show that they have no immunogenicity - just that the levels are similar to those of the originator . Concerns about immunogenicity appear to be generally unfounded and, as discussed on page 75, European-approved biosimilars have not been associated with any increase in the incidence of such adverse events, similar to the US position . Figure 6.1 illustrates immunogenicity data for biosimilar adalimumab . Clinical studies on a biosimilar prior to authorization are generally limited and, as for any new drug, postmarketing surveillance is required to enable identification of any rare adverse effects . Biosimilars are subject to the same degree of post-approval pharmacovigilance as the originator biologic . Crucial to this is product naming, as biosimilars and originators share the same international non-propriety drug name (INN) . In 2010, Europe updated its pharmacovigilance guidance requiring member states to encourage the use of brand names in prescribing, health records and adverse event reporting . This appears to have been successful . For example, product-specific attribution of epoetins is near 99%, and overall is 96% . However, such success has not been universal: for example, of 19 adverse event reports in the Australian Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) for filgrastim from 2011 to 2014, the full brand name was reported in only 11 (58%) . This is an issue that affects originator medicines as well - in the USA, for example, brand name reporting for different insulins was only 84% in the MedWatch system . In February 2019, a further step in the traceability of biologics was signaled in Europe with the final implementation of the Falsified Medicines Directive . Prior to full implementation, the European barcode standards could not automatically generate dynamic product information, such as batch numbers and expiry dates . This has been overcome by the introduction of 2D DataMatrix barcodes, which encode batch numbers and expiry dates . They are provided on both primary and secondary packaging, and inexpensive computer-readable laser scanners, as used for high street shops' stock control, can now track biologics through all points in the supply chain in different healthcare settings . Special reporting requirements may apply to biosimilars, even though they are versions of established originator brands, and they may likewise be assigned a black warning triangle requiring prescribers to report any adverse drug reactions . A risk minimization plan (RMP) is also a requirement for marketing a biosimilar; details are provided in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) . Real-world studies . Observational real-world pharmacoepidemiology data may be available for the originator biologic; the European Medicines Agency (EMA) encourages biosimilar manufacturers to participate in these studies, if available, or to begin a new program . 
The reported prevalence of anemia varies widely, but approximately 37% of congestive HF patients are affected . Clinical characteristics associated with anemia in the HF population are listed in Table 4.1 . Iron deficiency in the chronic HF population has a reported prevalence of 5-21% . Anemia of chronic disease is a form of anemia that occurs during chronic illness in response to inflammatory processes . Blood transfusion may be appropriate in an acute setting for selected patients with severe anemia . Trials of ESAs have shown an increased risk of thrombosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (and increased all-cause mortality in trials of patients with malignancy) . Therefore, these agents are not recommended as therapy . Pulmonary disease . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common comorbidity in patients with HF, with a prevalence of 10-46% . Cigarette smoking is strongly associated with COPD and coronary artery disease (CAD) . It also increases the risk of developing HF by 50% . Low-grade systemic inflammation is common in patients with COPD and vascular disease, so their coexistence accelerates atherosclerosis and contributes to the increase in adverse cardiovascular events . In patients with HF, COPD increases non-cardiovascular mortality and the overall hospitalization rate . Restrictive ventilatory defects are frequent in patients with compensated HF . They mask hyperinflation and obscure diagnosis of COPD in patients with HF . Respiratory infections are associated with HF decompensation in 10-16% of admissions . Pneumococcal and influenza A vaccinations of elderly patients with HF reduce the rate of hospitalization and associated costs . Sleep-disordered breathing in the form of obstructive (OSA) or central sleep apnea (CSA) is common in patients with HF (affecting 40-70% of patients) . increased sympathetic drive . inflammatory effects - an increase in NFKB1 transcription . procoagulant effect . Untreated sleep-disordered breathing is associated with higher cardiovascular mortality . A similar association has not been observed in patients without cardiac ischemia . Therapy for sleep-disordered breathing in patients with HF may include . However, up to 30% of patients may not be able to tolerate it . Renal disease . Renal dysfunction is frequently found in patients hospitalized with HF and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality . Up to 50% of ambulatory patients with stable HF have some degree of renal dysfunction . Moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction in patients with HF increases the relative mortality risk by 100% (absolute risk > 50% at 5 years) . It is generally accepted that renal dysfunction is a marker of progressive HF . CRS type 2 (chronic) - chronic HF leading to chronic kidney disease . CRS type 4 (chronic renocardiac syndrome) - chronic kidney disease contributing to cardiac dysfunction . In general, careful patient selection and monitoring are crucial . These drugs should not be initiated in patients with CRS type 3 or known bilateral renal artery stenosis . Liver disease . Transient abnormalities in liver function tests are relatively common in patients with chronic congestive HF . Acute ischemic hepatitis has been reported in patients with acute cardiac dysfunction (either new or decompensated chronic HF) . The illness is fairly common among patients with HF, with a reported prevalence of 10-25% in outpatients and 35-70% in inpatients . Most patients have mild symptoms, with fewer than 20% experiencing moderate or severe depression . Interestingly, patients with major depression are twice as likely to develop clinical HF over the course of their illness compared with patients without a mood disorder . A stronger risk was found in depressed patients with systolic hypertension . It is therefore not unexpected that depression in patients with HF is independently associated with poor prognosis, increased mortality and readmissions to hospital, and use of more medical resources . There are several proposed mechanisms by which depression leads to clinical deterioration and results in worse outcomes in patients with HF . They include . poor patient adherence . Initial screening in patients with HF may include the two questions from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 . 
Recurrence after initial surgery or radiotherapy usually manifests as a rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) . A prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scan (see page 52) may reveal sites of cancer recurrence at very low PSA levels, typically in the prostate bed (after prostatectomy), within the prostate (after radiotherapy) or in more distant lymph nodes or bone sites . Less commonly, pulmonary metastases may be detected . If the site of recurrence can be identified, appropriate therapy can then be delivered . Recurrence after prostatectomy . Risk factors for recurrence include . lymph node metastases at the time of surgery . higher-grade cancer (Gleason score >= 8) . The PSA level should reliably fall to below 0.1 ng/mL after prostatectomy . The recommendations for cut-off values that indicate cancer recurrence range from 0.2 to 0.5 ng/mL . Cancer recurrence is confirmed if the PSA level is above the cut-off and rising with sequential measurements, but time to metastasis and death is variable and is often quite prolonged . On average, a patient with recurrence of raised PSA will develop metastases over a median of 8 years, with death 5 years after the development of metastases . A number of factors determine how fast the cancer recurrence actually progresses . time to recurrence after prostatectomy - a shorter time to recurrence is associated with faster disease progression . doubling of the PSA level in less than 3 months is associated with shorter time to metastases and death . higher Gleason grade group is associated with faster progression (see pages 14 -) . When only a raised PSA level is seen, it is not known whether the recurrence is local (in the prostate bed) or systemic (metastases) . A number of choices are available for the management of PSA recurrence, including watchful waiting, salvage radiotherapy and hormonal therapy . Watchful waiting is ideal for a man with a limited life expectancy and/or lower probability of disease progression based on the earlier criteria . This treatment can be offered to men who have recurrence in the prostate bed or at distant metastatic sites confirmed by PSMA PET . Salvage radiotherapy is a potentially curative treatment for men with a high likelihood of residual cancer in the prostatic bed . It is also more effective if PSMA PET confirms that the prostate bed is the only site of recurrence . Hormonal therapy is reserved for men who have progressive PSA rises and are unlikely to harbor isolated local recurrence, or have confirmed widespread metastatic disease . The timing for initiation of hormonal therapy in these men is controversial, however . A recent randomized trial has shown that immediate hormonal therapy for PSA recurrence resulted in better overall survival (OS) than delayed treatment . Recurrence following radiation therapy . The definition of recurrence is less straightforward after radiation treatment than after surgery, and the natural history of PSA recurrence is less clear after radiation than surgery . Currently, recurrence after radiation therapy is defined as a PSA level that is 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir level . Once PSA recurrence has been identified, further investigations depend on the individual's circumstances and expectations, and involve determining whether the cancer is in the prostate, systemic or both . A prostate re-biopsy can be performed if salvage treatment for local disease is being considered, although tissue sampling is often more difficult because of post-radiation fibrosis, and the result is often negative . There are several options for treatment . Watchful waiting can be offered to men who have limited life expectancy, and/or progression of the cancer is slow . Hormonal therapy is usually reserved for men who do not have isolated localized disease . As when following prostatectomy, hormone therapy for recurrence after radiation therapy improves survival if given early . Oligometastatic disease . Disease is described as oligometastatic when metastases are limited (3-5) . This disease probably incorporates a spectrum of biologies, ranging from cancers that will soon become widespread metastases to those that will remain relatively indolent . While the results have been somewhat conflicting, only a small proportion of men gain long-term freedom from progression with these salvage therapies . Bone progression made a greater contribution to prostate cancer-specific mortality than progression at other sites . 
Recognizing depression . Most people with depression will have initial contact with primary care services and receive ongoing management from primary care practitioners . Clinician recognition . Studies conducted over several decades and in many countries have revealed that depression is missed in primary care consultations - particularly the initial presentation - relatively often . notation in the patient's clinical record of depression as a diagnosis or diagnostic code, or a clear description of depressive symptoms . referral of the patient to a mental health provider or prescription of antidepressant medication . clinician-rated depression or probable depression on an encounter form, or score sheet, or in response to a face-to-face interview . Furthermore, most studies of depression recognition in primary care have used a single time point to evaluate recognition, but this may be misleading as clinically significant depression is often detected by primary care providers at later consultations by virtue of the ongoing person-focused care that is the characteristic of primary care . There is evidence that recognition and treatment may occur at a subsequent visit . In one study, approximately half of those with unrecognized depression at baseline had some evidence of recognition at 3 months, as indicated by an antidepressant prescription or a mental health referral . Depression recognition can be examined in relation to patient, clinician/provider and context/system factors (Table 4.1) . Patient factors . Duration of depression . Effects of depression . For some patients, disclosure of depression during a consultation may be influenced by concerns about mental health problems being noted in their medical record . Mental health literacy . Many depressed primary care patients present exclusively with physical symptoms, which they do not attribute to psychological etiologies . Depression in health professionals . The high prevalence of depression among health professionals, as noted in Chapter 3, has particular challenges with respect to its recognition and management . Clinician factors . Several studies have shown a link between clinicians' attitudes and their management decisions, and between training courses and primary care physicians' attitudes to the identification and treatment of depression . Overall, clinicians surveyed in a number of European nations felt strongly that depression is amenable to change, and that looking after depressed patients is a rewarding activity . Presentation with concurrent physical problems increases the difficulty of recognizing depression . US primary care providers have been found to be less likely to detect depression among African-American and Hispanic patients than among white patients, particularly if the doctor and patient are of a different race . The limitations of consultation duration are a commonly quoted problem affecting the detection of depression . Improving depression recognition . Several approaches have been identified to improve the quality of depression recognition and management . These have been implemented and evaluated predominantly in primary care, as most people with depression are encountered in this environment . The use of case-finding measures . Given the substantial proportion of cases of depression missed in primary care, the use of case-finding tools is an appealing approach to assist recognition . There appear to be two main problems with screening or case finding for depression . The approach yields a large number of false-positive findings when used within an unselected primary care population . Where case finding is used without additional enhancement of the delivery of care, there is no effect on depression outcomes . Case finding for depression makes better sense and is more likely to be associated with clinical benefits when these two difficulties are addressed, and it is directed at patient groups with increased risks of depression, such as people with long-term physical health problems . The key issue with case finding is ensuring that systems are in place to provide evidence-based support and treatment for those people recognized as depressed . As discussed in Chapter 6, there are considerable deficits in depression treatment and follow-up . Many people who are recognized as depressed are not provided with appropriate treatment, and of those prescribed antidepressant medication more than half discontinue after an inadequate treatment period . This involves specific staff roles concerned with assessment, monitoring and coordination between the primary care provider's treatment and any specialty mental health treatment that may be required; further detail of these approaches to depression care are provided in Chapter 6 . Case-finding tools . A large number of case identification tools for depression are available . the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale . the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition . These standardized measures can play a useful part in the management of some groups of patients . The measures may play a part in monitoring response to treatment . The use of standardized measures as part of a more thorough assessment appears an appropriate approach for these patients . 
A biomarker is a 'characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathological processes or biological response to a therapeutic intervention' . As such, there are several different types of biomarker in ALS . To date, no such biomarker has been adopted in routine international clinical practice . Leading candidates include biofluid markers, and novel electrodiagnostic and neuroimaging techniques . However, most of the development of biomarkers to date has used healthy controls as the comparator . The distinction of ALS from healthy is not the clinical question facing the physician . Furthermore, the rarity of ALS and its essentially sporadic nature sets the bar extremely high for a diagnostic test that can be applied in the primary care setting . Prospective application of existing biomarker candidates within a specialized clinical setting is required to ensure that they add value to the diagnostic process . Biofluid biomarkers . Neurofilaments, the building blocks for the key cytoskeletal components of nervous system cells, are a leading biological-fluid-based biomarker for ALS . They are relatively stable in biofluids and are easily detected by antibody-based immunoassays . Rising levels also predate the onset of symptoms by several months in studies following asymptomatic carriers of ALS-causing genetic mutations . Blood levels of these proteins are significantly less sensitive than CSF measurements, although neither has yet been adequately validated as a diagnostic biomarker in patients suspected to have ALS . The stability of levels within an individual patient also boosts their potential as a pharmacodynamic biomarker, and many therapeutic trials are now including this measure . Neurotrophins are growth factors that promote neuronal cell differentiation and survival . It was shown to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of spinal-onset ALS in a small study . Urinary concentrations of the p75NTR extracellular domain have also been shown to rise in genetically susceptible individuals as the disease becomes clinically apparent . The urinary concentrations continue to rise with disease progression . Transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43) . Electrodiagnostic techniques . Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool used to demonstrate upper motor neuron (UMN) dysfunction . UMN pathology can be difficult to identify on clinical examination early in the disease and TMS may therefore be useful in identifying subclinical UMN disease, facilitating the early diagnosis of ALS . The technique uses a pulsed magnetic field directed at a small cortical area to induce local neuronal depolarization and hence the production of an action potential . Cortical hyperexcitability is important in the pathogenesis of ALS and can be demonstrated using a paired-pulse paradigm of threshold tracking . A reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition is most prominent in the early stages of ALS . TMS has now been well validated in ALS and may prove to be an important diagnostic tool in clinical practice . Other electrodiagnostic techniques . Motor unit number estimation, its surrogate motor unit number index and electrical impedance myography have all been used in the research setting to quantify lower motor neuron loss . None of these currently has diagnostic application over standard electromyography in ALS but they may prove useful in more objectively assessing disease progression and treatment response . Advanced neuroimaging . The application of MRI to the understanding of brain structure and function through novel advanced sequences and analysis tools has evolved far beyond the standard visual clinical image, which typically appears entirely normal . Such tools are unique in being able to capture the motor system more widely . As such, researchers have yet to find a role for these imaging techniques as a diagnostic biomarker . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a development of structural T2-based MRI that uses quantitative measures of water diffusion to estimate white matter tract integrity . In intact axons, water molecules predominantly diffuse parallel to the main tract direction, along the intact axons . Most water movement is therefore in a restricted direction within the tissue and is referred to as having a high fractional anisotropy . In damaged tissue, the movement of water molecules occurs across the tissue, unrestricted by axon orientation . There is, therefore, high mean diffusivity and low fractional anisotropy . However, DTI in isolation is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific . Automated segmentation of gray matter volumes has demonstrated more subtle cortical involvement in ALS . 
Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is a chronic hemolytic anemia associated with acute exacerbations, varying degrees of severity and the potential to be diagnosed at any age . The differential diagnosis includes a heterogeneous group of hemolytic disorders, both acquired and congenital (Figure 3.1) . This blood work-up helps to define the degree of anemia and the associated symptoms . Hemolytic parameters may vary in the different conditions, thus guiding the differential diagnosis . Acquired hemolytic anemias . Autoimmune hemolytic anemias . Types of autoimmune hemolytic anemia . Since AIHA may occur at any age, it should be considered a possibility in the differential diagnosis of congenital forms of hemolytic anemia . Other acquired hemolytic anemias . There are several other causes of acquired hemolysis (see Figure 3.1a) . The diagnostic work-up of all these conditions is beyond the scope of this book . The disease is easily diagnosed by flow cytometry analysis of GPI-deficient cells (PNH clones), and the clinical picture reflects the percentage of cells that are deficient . Infectious agent-mediated hemolytic anemia . Several infectious agents can cause hemolytic anemia, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus . Some of these disorders are associated with infections, including Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Shigella and HIV . In addition, valvular rheumatic heart disease and infectious endocarditis may cause extremely turbulent blood flow resulting in mechanical intravascular hemolysis . This type of mechanical hemolysis is increasingly seen among recipients of prosthetic heart valves . Drug-induced hemolytic anemia . Congenital hemolytic anemias . Examination of a blood smear is fundamental to guiding the differential diagnosis of congenital hemolytic anemias . This form involves a severe functional defect in spectrin (the major cytoskeletal protein of the RBC cell membrane); it is an autosomal recessive disorder, and manifests as a severe hemolytic anemia with thermal instability of RBCs . Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias . It is also worth considering the complex group of congenital dyserythropoietic anemias, which comprise several autosomal recessive disorders characterized by distinct morphological abnormalities of marrow erythroblasts . Typically, these anemias have some hemolytic features but an inadequate reticulocytosis . Diagnosis of the congenital dyserythropoietic anemias requires bone marrow evaluation and molecular characterization in most patients . When RBC morphology is unremarkable, a congenital hemolytic anemia due to an erythrocyte enzyme defect is highly likely . Generally, all RBC enzymopathies are characterized by chronic hemolysis, with the exception of the most common subtypes of G6PD deficiency . Hemolytic markers of disease . Reticulocytes may also be increased in other conditions such as hemorrhage, pregnancy and delivery, and acclimation . mildly elevated in acute hemolytic crises resulting from infections in association with congenital anemias, and in AIHA with complement activation . slightly increased in extravascular hemolysis (seen in warm AIHA and congenital hemolytic disorders) . Moreover, LDH levels may be markedly increased in patients with vitamin B or folic acid deficiency because of ineffective erythropoiesis and premature RBC death . On the other hand, haptoglobin increases in inflammatory diseases, in people who smoke and in nephrotic syndrome, possibly masking an underlying hemolytic condition . Ferritin is increased in chronic hemolytic conditions (membrane defects and enzymopathies, chronic cold agglutinin disease and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia) . It is an acute phase protein and also increases in various metabolic and inflammatory diseases, in hereditary hemochromatosis (even in heterozygous patients), and as a result of transfusion support (which is often given to hemolytic patients) . It is typically associated with marked intravascular hemolysis (PNH, G6PD deficiency) but is also found in reactions to incompatible RBC transfusions, severe burns and infections . 
As described in Chapter 1, genetic factors are an important determinant of ovarian cancer risk . Indeed, inherited genetic mutations are associated with about 15% of ovarian cancers, depending on the cancer subtype . Furthermore, some epithelial ovarian cancers result from somatic mutations, as well as mutations in other genes that are critical in DNA repair pathways . Importantly, the absence of a family history of ovarian cancer may not preclude a genetic predisposition: inherited mutations may be present in up to 25% of women with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), but up to half of these women may not have a family history of ovarian or breast cancer . For these reasons, genetic testing has a valuable role to play in identifying women at risk of ovarian cancer . It is important to differentiate between genetic counseling and genetic testing . Most experts stress that informed counseling should be given before genetic testing by a qualified healthcare professional, but not necessarily a genetic counselor . Currently, there is a shortage of counselors to provide timely consultations; hence, some propose direct genetic testing without counseling, with the reflex use of counselors for patients with positive or questionable findings . The development of multiplex gene panel testing to sequence multiple genes simultaneously may identify more individuals with cancer gene mutations than BRCA1 or BRCA2 testing alone . This development, alongside a marked decrease in the cost of genetic testing, means that routine genetic testing is now much more accessible than was previously the case . Guidelines for genetic testing . A number of organizations have published recommendations and guidelines for genetic counseling and testing (also see Further reading, page 31) . Most of these recommend that all women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should undergo genetic testing, irrespective of their family history or age at diagnosis . The majority of guidelines recommend that genetic testing should include both pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor or other appropriate healthcare professional with expertise in cancer genetics . The benefits of genetic testing in patients with ovarian cancer include . prognostic information for counseling . enabling amendments to screening recommendations and patient counseling, including consideration of surgical or non-surgical risk reduction strategies . the opportunity for cascade testing of relatives (see below) . Cascade testing . Cascade testing is the testing of close blood relatives of individuals known to be at high risk of genetic conditions . If a genetic mutation (exempli gratia a BRCA1 mutation) is identified through initial genetic testing of the patient, further testing for this mutation can then be offered to close blood relatives of the affected individual (Figure 3.1) . Using this strategy, it is only necessary to test for the specific mutation, rather than performing multigene testing; as a result, the cost of testing can be significantly reduced . The problem of under-referral . Despite the potential benefits of genetic testing in terms of identifying women at high risk of ovarian cancer, referral rates for genetic counseling services are low . In one study, only 14.5% of women with ovarian cancer who should have been referred according to the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines received a referral for genetic counseling, and of those only 59.5% opted for counseling (although it should be noted that about 95% of women who received counseling subsequently underwent genetic testing) . Significant predictors for referral included . family history, and increasing number of affected family members . Low referral rates have also been reported in the UK . Studies have suggested that this may be partly because of a reluctance among primary care providers to assume responsibility for controlling access to specialized genetic services . 
Patients will sometimes have no problems with their vision, but will present with concerns about an eye abnormality that they, their family or their optician has seen . Alternatively, you might notice an abnormality in the eyes of an asymptomatic patient . Many abnormalities of eye appearance are minor and of no consequence; however, some abnormalities herald serious disease and require urgent referral, ideally to be seen on the same day . Other patients with abnormal eye appearance may be referred routinely, unless other serious abnormalities are found when taking a history or during your eye examination . Causes according to presentation are as follows . Subacute or gradually progressive unilateral or bilateral proptosis with red eye/s is most commonly caused by thyroid eye disease (associated with Graves' disease) . Gradually progressive proptosis of one eye without redness is caused by orbital tumors . Patients complain of pain and sometimes double or blurred vision . Thyroid eye disease is the most common cause of proptosis in adults, and usually has a subacute or gradual onset . The eyes' appearance can range from slightly red to very red with severe conjunctival swelling . The course of the eye disease has no relation to the course of the hyperthyroidism (it may occur before, during or after the patient's hyperthyroid period), and treatment of the hyperthyroidism has no effect on the eye disease . Thyroid eye disease is not usually a dangerous eye condition, but it can be very annoying for patients who can suffer . cosmetic embarrassment due to their eye appearance . gritty, watering, irritable eyes . It is therefore essential to check the vision and look for a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in patients with thyroid eye disease . Orbital tumors . Tumors of many kinds may present with proptosis at any age . Abnormal optic disc/s . Sometimes you will discover an abnormal optic disc on ophthalmoscopy, despite the fact that the patient has not complained of eye problems . Bilateral disc swelling can also be seen in accelerated hypertension, so it is essential to check the patient's blood pressure in this situation . Patients with disc pallor usually complain of blurred vision or field loss; however, occasionally it is detected incidentally . Ongoing compression of the optic nerves or chiasm by a tumor is a relatively common cause of optic disc pallor . This disease is usually asymptomatic until advanced, because it causes a slow decrease in peripheral vision long before the patient notices central blurring . Sometimes a patient is noted to have different-sized pupils . The chance of serious disease is low if all of the following are present . the patient is asymptomatic . The common causes of unequal pupils are detailed below . They are completely asymptomatic, and have no ptosis or other abnormalities . Iris disease . Patients may complain of blurred vision, because they lose the ability to focus on near objects . The patient may also have depressed limb tendon reflexes of unknown cause (Holmes-Adie syndrome) . Dilating eye drops are a common cause of abnormal sized pupils . Always try to exclude this before referring the patient . Abnormal red reflex and/or white pupils . Normally, a patient's pupils look black on casual observation . Nystagmus is an uncontrollable, repetitive eye movement that usually affects both eyes . Causes include . poor vision in both eyes from early childhood (due to retinal or optic nerve disease, or congenital cataracts) . congenital or acquired brainstem or cerebellar disease (tumor, stroke, multiple sclerosis, metabolic disease) . middle-ear disease (exempli gratia Ménière's disease) . Abnormal spot on the eye surface . Patients or their relatives occasionally notice a spot on the surface of the eye . Common causes for this include . Squamous cell carcinoma is a common entity seen in patients with HIV, especially if they are not receiving antiretroviral treatment . These patients need urgent referral to an ophthalmologist, as early surgical intervention may save the patient's eye and life . Patients with newly noticed eye surface spots should be referred for an ophthalmic opinion; routine referral is adequate unless there is particular suspicion of malignancy . 
Non-adherence to secondary prevention guidelines is a major problem . Measures to improve adherence to medications and healthy lifestyle choices, improved awareness and education programs targeting both patients and healthcare providers are needed . Smoking cessation . Smokers are twice as likely to present with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as non-smokers . The goal must be to completely stop smoking as well as avoid exposure to environmental tobacco smoke . Once the patient's smoking status has been assessed, they should be referred to a smoking cessation program . The patient's family should also be encouraged to stop smoking to help with avoidance of secondhand smoking . The patient should be advised to quit and avoid passive smoking at all subsequent visits . Counseling, nicotine replacement, buproprion and antidepressants are all helpful elements in smoking rehabilitation efforts . For further information see Fast Facts: Smoking Cessation . Blood pressure control . For further information see Fast Facts: Hypertension . Diet and weight control . A reduction in bodyweight of 5-10% from baseline is an achievable initial goal . Healthcare providers are recommended to encourage patients to exercise regularly, regardless of age . European recommendations for a 'heart healthy' diet are shown in Table 6.1 . For further information see . Fast Facts: Obesity . Lipid management . At least a 30-40% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels is recommended when LDL-lowering medications are used . Lowering LDL cholesterol is also beneficial in patients with renal complications . For further information see Fast Facts: Hyperlipidemia . Physical activity . Exercise can reduce the anxiety associated with life-threatening illness and improve patients' self-confidence, cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise capacity . All patients should be risk assessed with a physical activity history and/or exercise test to guide prognosis and prescription . At least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (exempli gratia brisk walking) 7 days per week (minimum 5 days per week) is recommended . Medically supervised rehabilitation programs are useful for high-risk patients . Physical activity improves four key mechanisms, which are considered to be important mediators of a reduced cardiac event rate . improves endothelial function . reduces the progression of coronary lesions . reduces thrombogenic risk . increases the number of collateral vessels . Diabetes management . For further information see Fast Facts: Diabetes Mellitus . Treatment of depression . Depression is a frequent consequence of STEMI and also one of the most important predictors for the development of ACS . It has been reported that approximately 15% of patients who have had a MI experience major depressive disorder, while a further 15-20% exhibit mild to moderate depression . Depression remains poorly recognized and managed in patients with ACS . Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be particularly favorable in improving depression outcomes for cardiac patients and is recommended in international guidelines .

Aims of treatment . In addition to the risk of thrombosis, approximately 20% of patients experience hemorrhage and 4-8% experience severe bleeding before or at the time of diagnosis . Because of the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and disease progression, the principal aims of treatment in PV are to reduce the risk of primary or recurrent thrombosis and to control symptoms, but without increasing the risk of hemorrhage or disease transformation . Current treatment options . Current treatment strategies in PV (Table 5.1) focus on reducing the risk of thrombosis by . controlling an elevated hematocrit resulting from excessive red blood cell production . decreasing the risk of thrombosis, using aspirin . controlling erythrocytosis, leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis with cytoreductive therapy (in selected patients) . Stratification of treatment according to risk . As described in Chapter 3, the risk of thrombosis in patients with PV can be assessed on the basis of multiple factors, including age, history of thrombosis, platelet count and presence of cardiovascular risk factors (Table 3.5) . The level of risk is also influenced by the JAK2 V617F allele burden, although stratification by genetic risk is not currently widely used in clinical practice . Accurate risk stratification is essential because the level of risk has a marked impact on survival: patients with the highest risk have a median survival of approximately 11 years, compared with almost 30 years in those at low risk (Figure 5.3) . Phlebotomy to reduce the red cell mass is central to the treatment of PV in all patients . The requirement for phlebotomy tends to decrease over time . Cytoreductive therapy may be required in such patients and for patients with constitutive symptoms, symptomatic splenomegaly or uncontrolled myeloproliferation . Some patients become intolerant to repeated phlebotomy . All patients with PV should receive low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of thrombosis . Aspirin was also associated with reductions in secondary endpoints such as minor thrombosis . Cytoreductive therapy . First line . Hydroxyurea and interferon (IFN)-alpha (where licensed for PV) may be considered as first-line cytoreductive therapy . Patients with hydroxyurea-resistant PV may require repeated phlebotomy to maintain the hematocrit below 45% (Figure 5.5) . An increasing need for phlebotomy may therefore indicate inadequate disease control and the need to change treatment . A number of studies have investigated the efficacy of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib in patients with PV . RESPONSE-2 was a randomized open-label study involving 149 patients with phlebotomy-dependent PV without splenomegaly . At 28 weeks, hematocrit control was achieved in 62% of ruxolitinib-treated patients, compared with 19% of patients receiving best available treatment (p < 0.0001) . Similar treatment benefits were seen in patients in whom previous hydroxyurea treatment had been unsuccessful and in patients who had experienced intolerable adverse effects with hydroxyurea . A further study (MAJIC) is currently investigating the efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with high-risk PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea . Managing the risk of transformation to myelofibrosis/blast phase . It seems intuitive that patients with such risk factors should be treated as high risk, although it is currently unclear whether cytoreductive therapy reduces the risk . Patients should be monitored closely and non-leukemogenic treatments used . Criteria for treatment response . The aims of treatment should therefore be to control symptoms, prevent thrombosis and hemorrhage, to minimize the risk of transformation, and to control the hematocrit in all patients with a leukocyte count below 10 x 10 /L and in high-risk patients a platelet count below 400 x 10 /L . Inadequate control of PV can be evident as . frequent or increased need for phlebotomy to control the hematocrit (> 4 per year) . burdensome symptoms . clinical events such as thrombosis or bleeding (see Figure 4.3) . 
The term 'heart failure' (HF) is generally used to describe the physiological state in which cardiac function is insufficient to meet the metabolic needs of the tissues . A complete description of the HF syndrome in every patient should also recognize the following entities . diastolic versus systolic HF . acute versus chronic HF . right versus left (and biventricular) HF . high versus low output HF . Diastolic versus systolic heart failure . heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) when EF is less than 40% . heart failure with mid-range EF (HFmrEF) when EF is 40-49% . heart failure with preserved (or normal) EF (HFpEF/HFnEF) when EF is 50% or more . This is the typical manifestation of patients with ischemic heart disease and multiple infarcts . Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved (or normal) ejection fraction . It is the typical manifestation of patients with hypertensive heart disease and small ventricles with reduced stroke volume and filling disturbances . Prevalence increases with age . In one study, 15% of patients with clinical HF had normal LVEF and normal tests of diastolic function at rest . In addition, some symptomatic patients do not have HF . Their symptoms may be caused by fluid overload (due to renal disease) or obesity and physical deconditioning . Acute versus chronic heart failure . The terminology 'acute' and 'chronic' in this context relates to time rather than severity . An episode of acute HF can be defined as the sudden onset or gradual worsening of signs and symptoms of HF resulting in hospital admission . The typical presentation of acute HF is pulmonary edema . The combination of poor cardiac output (in 50% of patients with acute HF) and renal venous hypertension may precipitate a worsening of renal function and could cause cardiorenal syndrome (see Chapter 4) . HF may often be provoked by an acute illness (exempli gratia myocardial infarction [MI]) and may not be preceded by chronic symptoms . Recognizing the acuity of HF symptoms is an important aspect of managing HF as a chronic disease . Recognizing an exacerbation in a patient with chronic HF should lead to a search for the etiology of this change (see Chapter 3) . Left ventricular HF is the most common type of HF . High versus low output . The most common cause of high-output HF is marked obesity . HF affects an estimated 26 million people worldwide . This shift toward less ischemic heart disease is important for HF management approaches . The burden associated with HF is expected to keep rising over the next 20 years due to a number of factors . aging populations in developed countries . an increase in the number of elderly people with CAD and hypertension . Prevalence of HF in developed countries has increased over time; current estimates are shown in Table 1.1 . In those with CAD, a 28% decrease in 5-year mortality after MI was associated with a 25% increase in the 5-year rate of HF . About 70% of patients developed HF within 5 years, with two-thirds of clinical cases in the first year . Incidence of HF also increases with age . While there are some geographic and demographic variations (reflecting differences in the most common etiologies of HF), about half of all incident cases of HF are either systolic or diastolic HF . The re-hospitalization rate following index admission with HF is high (about 50% at 6 months) . Acute heart failure . While a history of chronic HF can be established in 80% of patients, 20% present with de novo cardiac dysfunction . In the USA, the age-adjusted rate for HF-related deaths decreased between 2000 and 2012, then increased slightly between 2012 and 2014 (see Figure 1.2) . However, as HF results from heterogeneous causes of cardiac damage, mortality rates vary . Over the past 50 years, the prevalence of CAD and diabetes mellitus has increased, while rates of valvular heart disease and hypertension have fallen . Population attributable risk estimates the proportion of HF in the population that is attributable to each predisposing condition . Additive risk . The presence of two or more predisposing conditions in the same individual increases the risk of developing HF . 
What is the benefit of treatment? . In general, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are used in ambulatory patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) . In patients with relapsing disease, existing therapies reduce the rate of relapse and slow the rate of lesion accumulation on MRI, but neither of these endpoints has a clear correlation with disability . It is important to consider this when initiating treatment, and to be realistic about what each treatment can offer . When to start disease-modifying treatment . An initial consideration in the management of MS is when to start treatment and which treatment to choose . Patients with active relapsing disease (usually defined as two relapses in a 2-year period) should be offered treatment, and an increasing body of evidence suggests that early therapy has advantages over delayed treatment (Figure 5.1) . Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who are at greater risk of developing MS (see Chapter 3) may benefit from early initiation of first-line therapies . Injectable therapy . The injectable therapies in MS are termed 'immunomodulatory' therapies and are considered one of the first-line options . Early initiation of treatment . In patients with the first relapse, there is evidence that these treatments delay the second clinical attack which can be the defining event to confirm MS . Early initiation of DMTs in this cohort can delay a second relapse by up to 12 months and reduce disability progression by more than 2-3 years . Injection issues . The mode and frequency of therapy may affect the treatment decision . Rarely, patients have 'needle phobia' and will not contemplate injectable therapy . Dosage, route of administration and common side effects of the injectable therapies are shown in Table 5.2 . After 2 years of treatment, up to 35% of patients taking interferon therapy produce neutralizing antibodies against the drug . These can reduce the efficacy of the treatment and are an indication to consider alternative treatment options . Oral therapies . Teriflunomide is a once-daily oral therapy, licensed for use in relapsing forms of MS (Table 5.3) . Side effects . Dimethyl fumarate, 240 mg twice daily, is an effective oral therapy that has shown promise as both a first-line treatment and escalation treatment for MS . Side effects . Guidelines recommend performing FBC before starting treatment and at 3-monthly intervals for the first year . Long-term safety data in patients with MS are lacking . Fingolimod was the first oral agent to be licensed for relapsing forms of MS . In the USA and Australia it is used as first-line therapy; globally, it is considered a second-line treatment for people whose MS remains active despite treatment with injectable or other oral DMTs . Side effects . Intravenous therapies . Initially licensed in the USA in 2004, it was the first therapy of this type for MS and seen as a breakthrough in treatment . Side effects . Alemtuzumab is licensed for use in active relapsing remitting MS, but it is the authors' preference to consider its use for patients with highly active disease, or for those with disease activity despite treatment with other DMTs . However, alemtuzumab does not appear to reduce gradual deterioration in patients with secondary progressive disease . Side effects . Immunosuppressive therapy . Mitoxantrone has largely been supplanted by natalizumab in patients with highly active relapsing MS despite conventional DMT . When to stop or escalate disease-modifying treatment . The indications for ceasing or escalating treatment are shown in Table 5.4 . Treatment escalation strategy . For patients with mild to moderate disease, a treatment escalation strategy has been advocated, starting with first-line injectable or oral DMTs . In patients with severe, or 'highly active' MS, natalizumab or alemtuzumab may be an appropriate choice, particularly when other therapies have failed . The treatment escalation paradigm is clearly not applicable in all patients with relapsing MS, in particular those presenting with rapidly evolving disease . Considerations other than efficacy and safety, for instance a strong patient preference for oral therapy, may also dictate treatment choice in relapsing MS . 
Over the past few years much work has been done in the field of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in terms of the clinical, pathological, biological and etiologic understanding of this diverse group of diseases . Nevertheless, controversy still exists with respect to the classification, biology and behavior of these neoplasms . WHO classification by type . The term cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) encompasses a wide range of disorders . The atypical cells in CTCL are usually CD4+ T cells, but may be CD8+; the latter is more common in children but is also seen in some adults . When the malignant cells are CD8+, the clinical presentation may be of hypopigmented patches rather than scaly red patches . In 2005 and 2008, an extensive classification of CTCL was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) . However, following research advances in biological and clinical behavior, the advisory committee recently released the initial 2016 Revision of the WHO Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms; the final version of this classification is expected later in 2016 . Although this revision contains minimal alterations to the 2008 classification (see Table 1.1), it helps to further define this group of diseases . Classification by clinical behavior . Clinicopathological correlation is crucial to the correct diagnosis of CTCL . However, the cytomorphology of T cells often does not correlate with the clinical behavior of the lymphoma, except in rare instances . Indolent CTCLs generally have a good prognosis and prolonged course, and often lack systemic symptoms . A number of these patients will progress to advanced/aggressive disease (around 25% of patients with MF) with a higher risk of secondary malignancies, particularly in those with LyP who may develop a systemic lymphoma . As such, all patients with indolent CTCL should be followed up closely for development of lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss or night sweats suggestive of systemic lymphoma or another cancer type . Although it tends to have an indolent course, the disease does progress in some patients, who have an aggressive projection with fevers, hepatosplenomegaly and systemic involvement . Aggressive CTCLs often progress rapidly with extracutaneous involvement, have a poor prognosis and are associated with systemic symptoms . These CTCLs warrant systemic treatment and generally display a cytotoxic immunophenotype . CTCLs are relatively rare diseases, with an annual age-adjusted incidence of 6.4 per million persons in the USA and similar worldwide . In the USA, the incidence of MF and non-MF has been reported to be 4.5 and 4.0 per million persons, respectively . African-American patients present with CTCL at a younger age than white patients (mean age of 51.5 vs 59.2 years) . While the incidence of CTCL rises sharply with age, it also occurs in pediatric and young adult populations . The overall incidence of both MF and non-MF CTCL is higher in men than women (Figure 1.2a), with a ratio of 2.2 to 1 . African-Americans have a higher incidence of both MF and non-MF than whites, Asian/Pacific islanders and Native Americans (Figure 1.2b) . Furthermore, African-Americans and hispanics have a statistically significant greater incidence of presenting at a more advanced stage of both MF and non-MF . Mortality from MF is 0.0064 per 100 000 person-years and is higher in men than women . Advanced age and black race are associated with poorer survival . Overall, 5-year survival rates for patients with CTCL are high (85%), ranging from 91% for patients with MF to 40% for patients with SS . Little is known of the etiology of MF . MF is also associated with other lymphomas of both T-cell (LyP, nodal CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma) and B-cell (Hodgkin's disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) origins . Furthermore, in some patients with a secondary T-cell neoplasm, the same T-cell clone has been identified in both lymphomas, indicating that they are derived from the same neoplastic clone . There does not appear to be a familial link in CTCL; however, there are reports of an increase in lymphoma in first-degree relatives of patients with CTCL . 
Glomerulonephritis is often described as primary, when there is no associated disease elsewhere, or secondary, when glomerular involvement is part of a systemic disease . This chapter considers primary glomerulonephritis; secondary glomerulonephritis is discussed in the context of systemic disease in Chapter 7 . Glomerulonephritis presents in a limited number of ways, depending on the nature and severity of the glomerular injury . Mild disease can present with asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria . More severe, acute forms of glomerulonephritis may present with 'acute nephritic syndrome', which involves hematuria (sometimes macroscopic), albuminuria, a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), salt and water retention, and hypertension . Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis describes a rapid loss of kidney function, such that the patient will be in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within weeks or months . Chronic glomerulonephritis involves a much slower deterioration in kidney function, usually over several years, accompanied by hematuria, albuminuria and hypertension . Hypertension may also be the presenting feature of some forms of glomerulonephritis . Except in the mildest cases, or in nephrotic syndrome in children, the suspicion of glomerulonephritis should lead to kidney biopsy . Minimal change disease . Some of the glomeruli show segmental scarring, together with foot process effacement as in minimal change disease . Other immunoglobulins and complement components may also be present . Focal and segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis is generally secondary to systemic disease (see Chapter 7) . Minimal change disease accounts for most cases of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 20% of cases in adults . It is associated with atopy in children and may be related to underlying Hodgkin's disease in adults . Relapsing disease may go into remission following treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide . Although severe nephrotic syndrome has its own complications (exempli gratia thrombotic episodes, infection), minimal change disease does not progress to ESKD . Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in older children and younger adults; it may be associated with hematuria . Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in older adults . Hematuria is rare . Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis is an uncommon disorder that can present as nephrotic syndrome or nephritic syndrome in children and young adults . Secondary forms of the disease are associated with hepatitis C with or without cryoglobulins, other chronic infections and SLE . Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide . It often presents with macroscopic hematuria, which may be precipitated within a few days by an upper respiratory tract infection . It is also detected as asymptomatic hematuria and/or albuminuria, and can present with nephrotic syndrome . Although progression is slow, 20-30% of patients may eventually develop ESKD . Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis generally presents with an acute nephritic syndrome 2 or more weeks after an infection . Classically, the disease is caused by streptococcal infection, either of the pharynx or the skin . Although rare in developed countries, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis remains common in the developing world . Many other bacterial and viral causes have now been described . Almost all children will recover without treatment (other than antibiotics for the infection), but a small proportion of adults may develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) . It presents with the clinical syndrome of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis . Without treatment, the disease progresses to ESKD within a few weeks or months, but prednisolone and cyclophosphamide are generally effective in patients before severe kidney damage occurs . The addition of plasma exchange or pulse doses of methylprednisolone is recommended in patients with advanced renal disease . The syndrome presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, usually leading to kidney failure within 6 months if untreated .

A few cases of sudden death have been reported following the procedure . Surgical ablation (maze procedure) . Betrixaban is a factor Xa inhibitor that is under development . Recommended dosages vary between countries . This DOAC has demonstrated efficacy in terms of stroke reduction . It can be reversed with prothrombin complex . New intravenous antidotes to oral anticoagulants . Such drug interactions must be considered and warfarin dosage adjusted where necessary . Anticoagulation for cardioversion . This occurs after spontaneous, pharmacological or electrical conversion . Left atrial appendage occlusion devices . Other options . Thoracoscopic surgical approaches to left atrial ligation are another option . 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition resulting from inflammation and degeneration within the central nervous system (CNS) . This inflammation can affect different sites at different times, producing a variety of symptoms and signs . In the early stages there are periods of relapse and remission, and in most patients a slowly progressive course ensues within one to two decades of disease onset . The cause of MS is unknown, but dysregulation of the immune system is central to the pathogenesis of the disease . MS is the leading cause of neurological disability in the young and middle-aged populations of the developed world . Survey figures from 2013 suggest that it affects around 100 000 people in the UK, 21 000 in Australia and 400 000 in the USA, and an estimated 2.3 million people worldwide . This is likely to be a significant underestimate as there is little published information on populations in many countries . The number of people with MS in a given population at any one time is usually expressed as cases per 100 000 population . Prevalence varies worldwide and in some countries exceeds 250 per 100 000 . Globally, the median estimated prevalence of MS is 33 per 100 000 . Regionally, the median estimated prevalence of MS is greatest in North America and Europe (140 and 108 per 100 000, respectively) . The estimated prevalence is 164 per 100 000 people in the UK, 95.6 per 100 000 in Australia and 135 per 100 000 in the USA . Prevalence varies significantly both within regions and within countries . It is not affected by changes in survival . The incidence of MS, which peaks at age 30, appears to be rising in both the northern and southern hemispheres, particularly in women . Geo-epidemiology of MS . The 'latitudinal gradient' in MS has been confirmed by independent studies in Australia, New Zealand and the USA, with exceptions in Sardinia and northern Scandinavia . In Australia, the prevalence in Tasmania is six times greater than that in northern Queensland . Genetic variation between geographically discrete populations has been invoked as one explanation for this observation, particularly within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) . MS is more common in women than men, at a ratio of 2-3:1 . An increasing incidence in females only has also been observed in Canada, Finland, Japan and southern hemisphere populations such as Australia . Environmental risk factors include . UV radiation and season of birth . levels of dietary vitamin D . Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection . Ultraviolet radiation and season of birth . This may be related to maternal exposure to UV light . Dietary vitamin D . Diet, dietary supplements and ambient UV exposure are all sources of vitamin D . Studies in clinically isolated syndromes have reported a delay before the second inflammatory episode in people with higher vitamin D levels . Epstein-Barr virus is a double-stranded DNA virus that is transmitted via saliva . EBV does not always cause illness, and early childhood infection with the virus is usually asymptomatic . The acute illness caused by EBV, infectious mononucleosis, often accompanies primary infection in adolescence or young adulthood . The nature of the association between EBV and MS is yet to be established, but the infection may trigger or potentiate autoimmunity . The risk appears to be greater in male (threefold) than female (twofold) smokers . Migration studies support a relationship between the country of origin and risk of MS . No single causative gene for MS has been identified . It is therefore likely that an individual's genetic background modulates susceptibility to environmental risk factors . These antigens are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (including dendritic cells, macrophages and B lymphocytes) . It may be that an effect of one gene is modified by several other genes (epistasis) . Furthermore, epigenetic modulation of MHC by environmental factors such as vitamin D, smoking, EBV infection and early-life hygiene may modify the effect of allelic variation at this site . An individual's genetic background may also explain the varied response to immunotherapy, and pharmacogenomic studies are ongoing . MS is more common in people with northern European ancestry . The incidence is lower in people of Asian/African or South American heritage . People living in the same environment with different ethnicities have different prevalence rates for MS . 
The mechanism and force of injury needs to be established through a thorough history and examination . Immediate urgent referral of patients with serious eye trauma can save sight in the injured eye/s (see opposite) . foreign body under the upper lid . corneal abrasion with no sign of penetrating eye injury or infection . Serious eye injuries . A patient suspected of having any of these injuries requires urgent referral . Penetrating eye injury . It is important to suspect a penetrating injury in any patient with a suggestive history such as hammering metal, which may, for example, cause a high velocity small fragment of metal to penetrate the eye . Even if the eye looks normal on examination, you must refer the patient urgently to an ophthalmologist because of the risk of intraocular infection or retinal toxicity to a metallic intraocular foreign body . Injuries range from the eye being struck with the sharp tip of a palm frond while gardening, which may result in an eye with normal vision that has a barely visible corneal laceration, to a patient whose eye has been severely lacerated with broken glass . eye pain, photophobia (sensitivity to light), blurred vision, floaters or field loss after a suspicious-sounding injury . Telephone an ophthalmologist immediately if you suspect your patient has a penetrating eye injury . An urgent slit-lamp examination and X-ray of the orbit should be carried out in any patient who says they have been hit in the eye with a high-speed fragment . Permanent corneal blood staining can also occur with high eye pressure . This injury should be suspected in any patient with blunt facial trauma who admits to double vision or a numb cheek or numb upper teeth on the side of the injury . They should be advised to not blow their nose after the injury as air can pass into the soft tissues . Acid and alkali burns can, however, often result in blindness or loss of the eye . Method of eye irrigation . If one eye is affected, it helps to position the patient on a bed and turn the patient's head so that the affected eye is pointing toward the pillow . All patients with a possible chemical burn of the eye who have significant pain, photophobia or blurred vision require urgent ophthalmic referral for slit-lamp examination and treatment (even if their eyes look normal on examination) after the irrigation has been performed . Thermal burn . For this reason, any patient with flame burns to the face requires urgent ambulance transfer to a general emergency department for systemic workup; an ophthalmologist will be consulted once life-threatening injuries have been excluded . Eyelid laceration . Because of the functional and cosmetic importance of the eyelids, these injuries should ideally be repaired by an ophthalmologist or plastic surgeon within 24 hours . Remember also to perform a careful eye examination, as there may also be a penetrating eye injury . The patient should be referred immediately if the problem persists or worsens . The patient complains of foreign body sensation and/or mild pain and photophobia . If the pain and photophobia are severe, you should suspect a superimposed infectious corneal ulcer and refer the patient immediately . Abrasions are frequently caused by scratches or minor blunt trauma to the eye, and often cause intense pain and foreign body sensation . You will need to review and re-pad the eye daily until it has healed . Subconjunctival hemorrhage looks startling, but is not serious unless there are other underlying injuries (such as a penetrating eye injury) . No treatment is needed if no other injuries are present, but it is worth checking the patient's blood pressure . It is not serious and will resolve spontaneously; however, it is possible to miss an underlying serious eye injury, such as hyphema or ruptured globe, because of difficulty examining the eye (the eyelids may be so swollen that they prevent eye examination, or the patient may be drunk or uncooperative) . It is essential that you measure VA in every patient with a 'black eye', and carry out as full an eye examination as is possible . If the initial examination reveals no serious eye injury, review the patient for re-examination in a few days . If you see the patient immediately after the injury, advise them to apply ice packs to the swollen eyelids and to sleep with their head elevated, which will reduce the swelling more quickly . If in any doubt, refer these patients to an ophthalmologist . 
The immune system combats foreign pathogens through innate and acquired (or adaptive) immunity (Figure 1.1) . It comprises the physical epithelial barrier, complement activation, some T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and phagocytic cells (neutrophils and macrophages) which engulf and remove pathogens . In the adaptive immune system, T and B cells recognize and respond to specific antigens, producing a tailored response to invading pathogens . Persistence of these 'experienced' T and B cells results in long-term immune memory . T cells develop from progenitors within the thymus gland . Mature T cells can be broadly classified into two types . T-helper cells, which are primarily involved in coordinating the immune response to an invading organism . cytotoxic T cells, which kill cells infected with microorganisms . T-cell receptors (TCRs) are analogous to the immunoglobulin molecules in B cells . Early T cells express TCRs in germline configuration . Recombination of TCR genes during maturation of T cells produces a unique TCR configuration - a critical feature of protective immunity that enables mature T cells to recognize and respond to a broad range of foreign material . These alphabeta T cells recognize and bind foreign peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells . This MHC-antigen complex binds to alphabeta TCRs, while other co-stimulatory molecules (exempli gratia CD28) are activated, leading to alphabeta T-cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and cytokine release . About 5% of T cells express a gamma and delta TCR (gammaδ T cells) . These cells have similarities with NK cells, with roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses . They are typically found at sites of antigen contact, such as the skin, spleen, liver, intestine and bone marrow . CD4 and CD8 . Lymphoid progenitor cells in the thymus undergo stepwise maturation (Figure 1.2) . The developing cells, called thymocytes, do not initially express CD4 or CD8 (described as double negative); expression of CD4 and CD8 is driven by positive signals received during development, resulting in double-positive thymocytes . Double-positive cells also encounter self-antigens and those that exhibit self-reactivity undergo negative selection . Finally, either CD4 or CD8 is downregulated, resulting in single-positive cells . The naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells enter the peripheral circulation from the thymus . CD8 + T cells recognize antigens presented by the MHC class I molecules found on nucleated cells . Once activated, the CD8 + T cells proliferate to produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes - a population of effector T cells which release the enzymes and toxins that induce apoptosis . CD4 + T cells recognize antigens presented by MHC class II molecules, which are only present on specialized antigen-presenting cells . Most of these cells are 'helper' subsets, which release cytokines, sending positive signals to other immune cells, predominantly B cells (Figure 1.3) . A unique subset of CD4+ T cells, called T regulatory cells, restrain the immune response via various cytokine and signaling mechanisms, preventing aberrant or exaggerated immune activation . Follicular helper T cells provide essential support for B-cell immune responses . Our understanding of T-cell subsets has advanced significantly over recent years . The external signals (cytokines) that trigger polarized T-cell differentiation are being elucidated, as are the molecular mechanisms that alter T-cell behavior to produce specific effector functions . Furthermore, gene expression profiling is being used to define the molecular signatures of T-cell subsets . These insights are refining our understanding of PTCL subtypes and have allowed the cell of origin to be identified for some (see Chapter 2) . Natural killer cells . NK cells are a type of lymphocyte derived from the same common lymphoid progenitor as B and T lymphocytes but develop primarily in the bone marrow . NK cells are typically considered part of the innate immune system because they rapidly produce inflammatory cytokines and directly kill infected cells without prior priming or activation . However, recent evidence suggests that NK cells are also important in adaptive immunity . 
Critically, the pharmacodynamic endpoints for biosimilars are usually surrogate rather than clinical results . The indications for rituximab are summarized in Table 10.1 . This is complicated further by the lack of uniformity between the biosimilar developers for the clinical confirmatory trials . The inclusion and exclusion criteria differ . Furthermore, patients often relapse following a complete clinical response to initial treatment . Three of those trials also show OS benefit of 6-13% at 4 years . Its indications are shown in Table 10.3 . It has two principal modes of action that are important to consider when reviewing the clinical confirmatory trials of biosimilars . To further increase complexity, trastuzumab is associated with cardiac toxicity . Confirmatory clinical trials . It can be frustrating for clinicians that two very different models for demonstrating clinical comparability were used for trastuzumab . In the case of cardiac toxicity from trastuzumab, with no consensus on the probable mechanism of toxicity, the confirmatory clinical trials had to be powered to provide a clinical endpoint . The EPAR for ABP-980 discusses potential reasons why the clinical confirmatory trial was non-equivalent . This European decision to endorse two biosimilars when clinical studies do not show statistical equivalence may appear contradictory to biosimilar regulation that mandates clinical confirmatory studies as an essential step to approval . Regulators, however, emphasize that approval is based on the 'totality of the data' . Proponents of this approach, placing analytics and pharmacology ahead of clinical studies, point out that for decades analytic comparability has reduced the need for clinical studies after manufacturing changes . For the recognition of biosimilarity to be a true science, there should be complete conformity between regulators . The situation for trastuzumab, to June 2019, is summarized in Table 10.7 . Neoadjuvant or metastatic trial settings for trastuzumab biosimilars . Scientifically, we should choose the most sensitive of the labeled other indications to detect difference and extrapolate that data to other indications . There is also a need to collect safety data; in the example of trastuzumab, where the mechanism of toxicity behind cardiac damage is poorly understood, clinical trials need to be powered sufficiently to deliver such clinical data . For trastuzumab, we have a choice of two labeled indications that can report primary endpoints in trial follow-up of 12 months or less (Table 10.8) . had a median of 7.4 months for time to disease progression for trastuzumab and chemotherapy . On balance, there is no clear winning trial design . Subcutaneous trastuzumab and shorter trastuzumab schedules . By sparing infusion facilities, it has a significant time impact for hospitals and clinics during the monotherapy phase of trastuzumab treatment . However, its many indications have secured bevacizumab annual global sales of US$6.7 billion, making it an attractive agent for biosimilar developers . Biosimilars are permitted to have differences compared with the original reference medicine, but only as long as these are predicted to deliver no clinically meaningful differences in practice . For biosimilars of bevacizumab, we can gain insight into the approaches of the developer and regulator over such an analytic difference from data reviewed by the ODAC in July 2017 . This could represent a difference in a CQA, and the developer had to demonstrate why such a difference would be unlikely to create any clinically meaningful difference in safety or efficacy . Such issues cannot be assessed by the drug regulators as use in wet ARMD is unlicensed . Confirmatory clinical trial design . There is a problem for clinical confirmatory studies with bevacizumab . Designing confirmatory trials is also a problem, as the most useful indication is one with the greatest difference in pharmacodynamic endpoints for the reference drug . As bevacizumab was the first approved anti-VEGF agent, it was used off-label for ARMD treatment and proved successful . Off-label drug use needs to be considered on an individual basis, judging whether the evidence of benefit outweighs the risks for that patient . There is not only the individual risk and benefit to patients to be considered in choosing bevacizumab brands . With biosimilars, there is a new problem of extrapolation . 
Clinical presentation . Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness (Table 3.1) . Symptoms of MG tend to worsen with concurrent illness, over-exertion of the muscle (exempli gratia fatigue from speaking or eating), the use of certain medications, and as the day progresses . Ocular symptoms . Approximately two-thirds of patients initially present with ocular symptoms . Neurological examination often discloses evidence of ptosis or dysconjugate gaze on testing of extraocular movements, which may demonstrate fatigability with sustained upward or lateral gaze . Weakness of the eye muscles is often asymmetric and variable - a combination of alternating ptosis and diplopia in any direction . Generalized symptoms . The disease spreads beyond the eye muscle in over 80% of patients, with a predilection for bulbar, facial, neck and proximal limb muscle involvement . Dysarthria or dysphonia may manifest after the patient speaks for a prolonged period of time . Testing of neck and limb muscles should likewise be done after a period of exercise to evaluate for evidence of fatigability . Respiratory muscles may also be affected, leading to dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea . Myasthenic crisis . This necessitates intubation and mechanical ventilation until clinical improvement in strength occurs . Diagnostic work-up . In most instances, the clinician can be confident about the diagnosis of MG based on a characteristic history and physical examination . However, one or more tests are routinely performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis . Antibody testing . If these antibodies are present, no further diagnostic testing is usually required other than to evaluate for the presence of a thymoma with either CT or MRI of the thorax . In children with myasthenic features but with AChR-, clustered AChR- and MuSK-antibody negativity, congenital (genetic) myasthenic syndromes should be considered . Electrophysiological tests . In other words, lack of decrement in a muscle that is reported to be weak may indicate a cause other than MG . Edrophonium test . A positive edrophonium test ('Tensilon test') can also be used to confirm the diagnosis . Conventional management . These agents are often the initial therapeutic intervention in MG . They work by inhibiting the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh) at the synapse, allowing the neurotransmitter to accumulate at the NMJ, prolonging its activity and increasing the number of neurotransmitter and AChR interactions . Pyridostigmine bromide is the preferred acetylcholinesterase inhibitor as it has a longer half-life and a more favorable side-effect profile than other available agents . Corticosteroids were the first immunosuppressant drugs to be widely used in the treatment of MG . They produce significant clinical improvement in the vast majority of patients . Once reached, this dose is usually maintained for 1-3 months, with a slow taper thereafter . Some clinicians will discontinue acetylcholinesterase inhibitors before starting a steroid taper to ensure patients are not dependent on these agents for symptomatic control . 'Steroid-sparing' agents . These include azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin (cyclosporine) and tacrolimus . A trial of one of these drugs is recommended in patients who are unable to tolerate the dose of corticosteroid required to control their symptoms or who relapse during a steroid taper . It is also used for chronic management in selected refractory patients . Intravenous Ig and plasmapheresis are less often used for maintenance therapy . Thymectomy has been regularly performed for MG in patients with and without thymoma since 1939 . Thymectomy is of greatest benefit in patients younger than 40 years of age, but maximal benefit may not be seen until 3 years after surgery . Management of refractory patients . When patients with MG are deemed to be refractory to conventional treatment (see page 8), consideration of additional therapeutic options is warranted in order to improve quality of life, reduce morbidity and prevent life-threatening crises and death . Other treatment options are emerging . 
Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is characterized by an increased platelet count, associated with megakaryocytic hyperplasia . Polycythemia vera (PV) is predominantly characterized by excessive erythrocyte production, with variable megakaryocytic and granulocytic hyperplasia . Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a more heterogeneous disorder, characterized by bone marrow fibrosis with megakaryocytic and granulocytic hyperplasia and erythroid hypoplasia . The genetic basis of these MPNs has been elucidated over the last two decades but emerging evidence suggests that non-genetic factors such as age and inflammation also play important roles in their development and progression . Genetic basis . Driver mutations . JAK2 mutations . Activation of these receptors triggers increased signaling via the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)-5, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathways . Although these JAK2 mutations are not usually associated with PMF, they can lead to the development of post-PV myelofibrosis . JAK2 mutation-negative PV can occur but is rare . MPL mutations . The MPL gene encodes the thrombopoietin receptor . CALR mutations . The CALR gene encodes calreticulin, a multifunctional protein that acts as a calcium storage protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and as a molecular chaperone, facilitating the folding and unfolding of proteins and other macromolecules . Type 1 mutations are most common . Triple-negative MPN has features consistent with MPN (typically ET or PMF; rarely PV) but lacks one of the common driver mutations . Non-driver mutations have also been implicated in the initiation and progression of MPNs . These include mutations affecting . intracellular signaling pathways . epigenetic regulators such as DNA methylators and histone modifiers . transcription factors . RNA splicing . The involvement of these genes in disease initiation and progression is summarized in Table 1.2 . Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) . CHIP describes the acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenia and dysplastic hematopoiesis . The prevalence of CHIP increases with age, reaching approximately 10% among individuals aged 70-80 years . The key features of this condition are summarized in Table 1.3 . Thus, CHIP can be considered a precursor of hematopoietic neoplasms, analogous to the relationship between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and multiple myeloma, or between monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis and chronic lymphocytic leukemia . A recent study has shown that the presence of CHIP in peripheral blood is associated with an approximately twofold increase in the risk of coronary heart disease, and with accelerated atherosclerosis in animal models . The greatest increase in risk is seen in carriers of the DNMT3A and TET2 mutations . Inflammation appears to play a key role in the development of PMF, and the other MPNs to a lesser extent . These conditions are marked by increased circulating concentrations of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor, and symptoms of inflammation such as fatigue, fever and night sweats . Other environmental factors . Environmental factors, notably age and genetic predisposition, appear to influence the initiation of MPNs . In particular, increasing age is associated with deregulation of hematopoietic stem cells, which may provide an environment that favors JAK2 V617F expression . A number of genetic variants appear to confer a predisposition to the development of MPN . These include . genes affecting JAK2/STAT signaling (exempli gratia JAK2 46/1 haplotype, SH2B3) . genes involved in DNA damage repair (exempli gratia CYHEK2, TERT) . transcription factors (exempli gratia GF11B, MECOM) . non-coding RNA genes (exempli gratia PINT) . 
In general, follow-up aims not only to diagnose relapse, but also to holistically assess and manage ongoing physical, psychological, emotional, financial and sexual survivorship issues . Follow-up . Traditionally, in accordance with various national and international guidelines, patients are followed up at 3-month intervals in the first 3 years, and 6-month intervals thereafter, depending on their symptoms and overall clinical picture . However, follow-up practice varies markedly, and each center usually has its own guidelines and protocols, without any evidence for the superiority of one approach over another . Typically, follow-up consists of an interview with the patient, assessment of any potential tumor-related symptoms, clinical examination and possibly also investigations for the diagnosis of common tumor-related symptoms (Table 10.1) . Serial measurement of CA125 often forms part of follow-up, because elevations of CA125 precede symptomatic relapse by a median of 4.5 months (range 0.5-29.5 months) . However, this approach failed to demonstrate any significant effect on patients' survival in the UK-based prospective randomized MRC/EORTC trial, in which there was no difference in overall survival between patients who received chemotherapy based on a rising CA125 level and those who did not receive chemotherapy until they were symptomatic (Figure 10.1) . In this study, however, only 6% of the patients underwent surgery for relapsed disease . Depending on the final analysis of the DESKTOP III survival data, follow-up for ovarian cancer may need to be reshaped and redefined, as it may be worthwhile detecting the disease while it is apparently operable and when the patient has a good performance status . The emerging trend of targeted maintenance treatments for advanced ovarian cancer is also reshaping the approach to follow-up, since in this situation patients are visiting their oncologists over prolonged periods, and assessments of treatment efficacy and adverse events are performed regularly . Patients undergoing fertility-sparing treatment should receive regular ultrasonographic examination of the contralateral ovary and the endometrial cavity to diagnose relapse in the remaining Müllerian organs . Depending on the initial stage, the patient's wishes and reproductive history and her overall response to cancer treatment, removal of the uterus and contralateral ovary may be discussed after completion of childbearing . There is increasing interest in the impact of psycho-oncologic support interventions in women treated for ovarian cancer . Numerous studies are addressing the potential long-term effect of such interventions . Palliative salvage surgery . Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer often present with symptoms of impaired intestinal transit or clinical bowel obstruction at relapse, which is attributable to the diffuse peritoneal dissemination of recurrent tumor . The use of novel targeted therapies with anti-angiogenic potential may favor fistula formation or intestinal perforation, and so recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer with the potential for such severe acute complications constitutes a therapeutic dilemma . Risks versus benefits . Any perceived benefits should be carefully balanced against the risks for each individual patient along with factors such as comorbidities, baseline quality of life, previous response to chemotherapy, length of treatment intervals and the patient's wishes . The management of these cases should be led by specialist gynecologic multidisciplinary teams . Intraoperative input from gynecologic oncologists is important to ensure that both the meaningful responses possible after palliative surgery and the likelihood of disease response to chemotherapy are duly considered when making intraoperative decisions . Endoscopic techniques such as placement of intestinal stents and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may allow the palliation of gastrointestinal symptoms, with reduced procedure-related morbidity in selected patients . Surgical intervention should be restricted to patients who have a distal mechanical bowel obstruction and in whom the formation of a proximal small bowel stoma is not likely to be necessary, as such high-output stomas significantly reduce patients' quality of life and necessitate permanent total parenteral nutrition . Preoperative imaging demonstrating the most proximal point of bowel obstruction should be used to identify patients with a level of obstruction that presents a high risk of iatrogenic short bowel syndrome . The severe peritoneal carcinomatosis and inflammation present in epithelial ovarian cancer recurrence makes surgical dissection hazardous, and renders the successful repair of enterotomies without fistula formation challenging . Considering the balance of risk and benefits, few patients are suitable for palliative defunctioning or bypass procedures, and therefore multidisciplinary teams with experience in managing such cases and their potential complications should be responsible for the careful selection and care of those who do undergo surgery . 
Many more people make suicide attempts or self-harming acts than kill themselves: self-harm is estimated to be 20 times more common than suicide, and a history of self-harm is an important risk factor for completed suicide . Epidemiology of suicide . Global rate changes . This equates to a decline in global age-standardized suicide rates of 30% over the 15 years to 2015 . For some countries, such as Finland and Hungary, rates halved during this period, whereas in Korea there was a dramatic rise in suicide . Age trends . Global data show a picture of the rising prevalence of completed suicide with age . Worldwide, older people have the highest rate of completed suicide of any age group, with the pooled international rate increasing gradually with age . However, pooled rates mask considerable differences in age distributions in different nations . Over the last few decades, there has been a rising trend of youth suicide . The relative rates of suicides within specific age groups differ markedly in particular countries and regions: in Australia, the UK and the USA, the rate in the 15-19 years age group is close to the mean rate for the country, while in Russia the rate among this age group is around three times higher than the mean rate . Some similarities in suicide trends are apparent in the data from the UK and Australia, where the rates of suicide among young men increased from around 1970 until the early or mid-1990s but have subsequently declined . In almost all world regions and across all age groups, suicide is more common in men than in women . In rural China, there is an increased rate of suicide among women compared to men, and this is strongest in women aged 20-34 years . There are large-scale variations in suicide prevalence between nations and cultures . (Because data have been age-standardized to the WHO Standard World Population, these rates differ from national data or those using other population standards . Overall, the higher rates appear evident in the countries of the Russian Federation and Eastern Europe, and the lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Latin America . Additionally, high rates are evident in several island countries: Sri Lanka, Japan, Cuba and Mauritius . Figure 8.4 shows latest available suicide rates for OECD countries, and Figure 8.5 shows global suicide rates . Although study findings are mixed, there is evidence that the 2008 economic recession was associated with increases in suicide rates, particularly among males of working age . Several reviews indicate that a protective relationship exists between religious beliefs and completed suicide . Unemployment, poverty and residential instability are associated with suicide in observational analyses within and between nations . Recent analysis of data from 25 European Union countries indicates that high suicide rates are strongly correlated with at-risk-of-poverty rates and low healthcare expenditures . Heavy drinking and binge drinking - particularly when involving spirits - appear to be associated with raised suicide rates . High-risk occupational groups . Depression and suicide . Although the rate of suicide in people with depression in the USA and UK is often quoted as 15%, this figure is based on a selective sample of patients with severe depression . Additionally, family conflict, serious physical illness and loneliness are all associated with completed suicide . Risk factors for suicide . There is general agreement between research evidence and clinical experience that the two key risk factors for suicide are . More general factors associated with suicide include . Suicide in prisoners . A recent systematic review of risk factors, based on nearly 5000 prison suicides in 12 countries, has identified that risk is strongly associated with . a history of attempted suicide . Self-harm . People who die by suicide represent only a fraction of the number who harm themselves in response to life problems or contemplate suicide . Acts of self-harm are relatively common, particularly among young people . This notwithstanding, self-harm acts are a strong predictor of future suicidal behavior, and require careful and sensitive assessment and management . Rates of self-harm peak around the age of 14-17 years, with this appearing consistent in cross-national studies . A history of self-harm is the strongest predictor of future suicide, increasing the risk by 50-100-fold compared with people who have not self-harmed . Management of self-harm . Table 8.1 shows the main elements of risk assessment procedure for individuals who present following self-harm . Suicide prevention programs . A strategy for suicide prevention requires increased awareness of suicidal behaviors and approaches to their prevention . 
Switching, interchangeability and extrapolation are important for the practical use of biosimilars - and surveys in Europe and the USA show that they remain among the least understood issues when it comes to biosimilars . Switching and interchangeability . The ability to switch patients between different brands of the same biologic is critical for developing a competitive drug market to check costs . To a European, 'interchangeable' means a physician-led process, often in the context of medicines formulary committee decisions . There is a second potential for brand switching, through 'automatic substitution' of prescriptions at a pharmacy level . This can occur when specialist biologics are dispensed through retail pharmacies - an unusual situation for most of Europe but more prevalent in the USA . Confusingly, in the USA, automatic substitution of prescriptions at a pharmacy level is called 'interchangeability' . In Australia, it is known as 'flagging' . The USA and Australia have specific regulatory requirements for biosimilars that can be substituted . Automatic substitution of drugs by pharmacists is considered to create price competition between manufacturers that will reduce costs and promote patient uptake, analogous to the effect of generic substitution with small molecule drugs (Figure 5.1) . In the USA, the medicines regulator took a central role in defining generic medicines policy, commissioning five separate external advisory committees on the topic between 1967 and 1975 before finally agreeing bioequivalence policy in 1984 . For the USA, this US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policy is credited with significant cost-savings, as between 1987 and 1993 the proportion of health maintenance organizations that allowed therapeutic substitution in non-hospital pharmacies doubled to 70% . American physicians seem to be in general agreement with this policy . A study by the US-based CVS Caremark Pharmacy showed that only 5% of prescriptions were designated 'dispense as written' (DAW) by prescribers, forbidding brand substitution; although the cost of this tiny minority to the US healthcare system has been estimated at a not insignificant $7.7 billion annually! . Currently, postmarketing data collected for a biosimilar, without corresponding data derived from an appropriately designed, prospective, controlled switching study or studies, would probably not be sufficient to support a demonstration of interchangeability . Just as automatic substitution of generic drugs was promoted in the USA through the FDA's Orange Book, listing approved substitutions, the FDA has similar listings for interchangeable biosimilars in an FDA Purple Book . In Europe, policies for automatic substitution of medicines are considered outside the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA); despite one shared medicines regulator, generic drug substitution is mandatory in 13 countries, voluntary in 14 and forbidden in five . In Australia, the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule lists drugs with both A-flagging and B-flagging . A-flagging denotes that brand substitution can occur at dispensing without expecting differences in clinical effect and is analogous to the US definition of interchangeable . To gain A-flag status, a drug developer must submit evidence of bioequivalence or therapeutic equivalence to the Australian medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration . The lack of A-flagging does not necessarily reflect a lack of safety or efficacy, as often these are drugs approved in an earlier regulatory era . B-flagging indicates that these brands are also equivalent, but that it is not known if there is equivalence between brands marked 'a' and brands marked 'b' . The clinical study is likely to involve the most sensitive patient group/study endpoint(s), selected in discussion with regulators . Therefore, at launch, the comparability of a biosimilar with its reference product may have been demonstrated in only one of the reference product's indications . If the biosimilar medicine is 'essentially the same' as the reference medicine, then it will behave clinically the same way in all indications . The indications, warnings and contraindications set out in the summary of product characteristics (SPC, or prescribing information) for the biosimilar will be drawn from the SPC of the originator . Extrapolation for biosimilars in oncology will be critical in reducing the costs of development of follow-on biologics . Even then, confirmatory clinical trials still represent 70% of the costs of biosimilar development and a large part of the drug development timeline . Note that, despite the approval of an extrapolated indication for a biosimilar by Europe's regulator, this may not be available in all countries because of individual national patent laws . 
Surgery is often the final stage of treatment for many patients with arthritis . The aim of surgical procedures is to reduce pain and improve function; these procedures involve techniques that . preserve or restore joint surfaces . replace joints with artificial implants . fuse joints (arthrodeses) . Patient selection . The decision to consider surgical intervention should be made after conservative treatment approaches - adequate analgesia, muscle strengthening and weight loss if appropriate - have been exhausted . Each case must be assessed individually, and should include an analysis of the patient's . severity of symptoms . functional limitations . general health . Radiographic findings may add to the assessment, but do not provide a reliable basis for referral decisions, as they do not correlate perfectly with symptoms . This chapter provides a general overview of a number of relatively common procedures . Arthroscopic debridement and lavage . Lavage - the process of 'washing out' the joint - aims to remove debris such as fragments of cartilage and calcium phosphate crystals . A recent randomized trial found that, among patients with a degenerative meniscus tear, knee arthroscopy was no better than exercise therapy . Closed needle lavage or tidal irrigation may have a role, but further studies are required . Osteotomy involves incision with possible excision of bone to correct a joint deformity . This procedure is generally reserved for younger patients, and even children, in an attempt to prevent or reduce premature OA . High tibial osteotomy of the knee may be useful in younger patients with medial compartment OA and early-stage radiographic disease . Total knee or hip replacement . Knee and hip replacements are amongst the most commonly performed surgical procedures . People referred for surgery should understand both the benefits and risks of the particular procedure . Severe complications are rare but may include blood clots (deep venous thrombosis of the leg) or wound infection, which could have potentially devastating results . Even with this aggressive form of treatment, the success rate is only about 80% . Patients may have persistent pain, a feeling of artificial motion in the joint, and may even hear the prosthetic components articulating . These complaints are more common in knee replacements . However, overall satisfaction remains very high . Postoperative expectations . More recently, next-day discharge and even same-day outpatient surgery has become common . Adequate analgesia in the perioperative period is essential to aid rehabilitation (although many patients may require less analgesia than preoperatively) . Expectations for postoperative activity levels should be realistic . Traditionally, patients have been told that they will not be able to drive or work in the first 6-8 weeks . There remains much debate among joint replacement surgeons about postoperative restriction of movement and functional limitation . Joint-conserving surgery . Replacement of the medial compartment of the knee is most common . Benefits of this procedure compared with total joint replacement include a smaller surgical incision, shorter length of stay in hospital and quicker rehabilitation . Long-term outcome studies, and joint registry data in particular, demonstrate decreased survivorship after partial knee replacement compared with total knee replacement . Femoral head resurfacing involves replacement of the surface of the femoral head without removal of the neck of the femur . This procedure is generally used in younger people, but anatomic factors of the hip joint are also relevant in selection of appropriate candidates . Modern femoral head resurfacing implants involving a metal-on-metal articulation have led to poor results in a significant number of patients . Tissue engineering . A number of other surgical procedures that use tissue- and cell-based repair of cartilage loss are performed in specialist centers . These techniques are highly specialized, successful tissue regeneration is inconsistent, and time to normal activity can be more than a year . Hand surgery . Sometimes a joint replacement implant is inserted, and ligament reconstruction may also be performed . Such procedures have few complications and high rates of pain relief . Foot and ankle surgery . Shoulder surgery . It does, however, involve a prolonged rehabilitation and recovery period . Debridement and synovectomy procedures can be performed arthroscopically . Degenerative tears of the rotator cuff can also be repaired in some instances . 
Moreover, the clinical trials process, which is essential to increasing our understanding of cancer, is all about risk . Three definitions form the basis of risk assessment . risk or odds . consequence or harm . Risk is a measurement of likelihood, or how often an event takes place . It is a proportional quantity . Explaining the concept of risk . People have some sense of the total effect of a specific risk . The event risks are constantly changing . Thus, when explaining the concept of risk to a patient, there are a number of points worth considering . Set risk in context by comparing the risk of breast cancer with that of trauma or heart disease: for example, for non-smoking women, the 10-year risks of death from breast cancer and heart disease are similar until the age of 60 (typically <= 1%) . The overall risk of dying from breast cancer lies between 1% and 2% from 40 to 50 years of age and between 2% and 3% from 50 to 60 years . Make the distinction between risk and consequence (see below) . Explain that risk is a proportional quantity (Figure 2.1 - see text for full figure description) . Explain that all interventions, including doing nothing, involve a trade-off of risks . This is not peculiar to breast cancer risk but reflects the fundamental difficulty in truly understanding the meaning of probability . Point A is the proportion who had recurrences despite treatment, 17.2% (100 - 82.8) . The risk reduction can be presented two ways . as a proportion of the treatment population, sometimes called the absolute benefit, calculated as the risk without treatment minus the risk with treatment, in this case 82.8 - 74.2 = 8.6% . Again, the risk reduction can be presented two ways . The total effect of a given risk is the product of the risk and the consequence . There is an important corollary to the notion that no risk exists in isolation . Conceptually, the proper approach to the assessment of risk would be to sum the product of all possible risks and their consequences . The concept of relative or proportionate risk underlies all of medicine . A small proportionate advance against a high-frequency risk may be of greater consequence than a large advance against a rare risk . The risk in 'real terms' . Describing the risk of developing breast cancer as 1 in 10-12 is true, yet unhelpful, because this figure is the cumulative lifetime risk . It is important to explain what any increase in relative risk means in real terms . Early data suggested that the breast cancer risk of women who carry mutations could be as high as 85%, but more recent data from Europe indicate that the risk is of the order of 50% . Treatment of early breast cancer . Proportional risk is perhaps the most important concept to arise from the many trials of systemic (adjuvant) therapy for early breast cancer . Each type of treatment reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence by a relatively constant proportion . Thus, in premenopausal women, chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence by 33% and oophorectomy by about 25%, while in postmenopausal women tamoxifen reduces the risk by about 40% . Thus, the benefit for a given woman in absolute terms depends on both the effect of treatment on the relative risk and the underlying individual risk factors . Fundamental to interpreting estimates of benefit is the understanding that the proportion being calculated relates to the number of adverse events, not the number of individuals at risk . If adjuvant chemotherapy produces a relative risk reduction of about 30% then, in absolute terms, the patient gains 30% of the 10% risk of recurrence, which is about 3% . On the other hand, if the same woman has four nodes involved, her 10-year risk of recurrence is about 50% . The treatment offers a 30% relative risk reduction, leading to an absolute benefit of 30% of 50%: a 15% decrease in the probability of recurrence within 10 years . First, the data from which these recommendations derive are generally specific for the risk of breast cancer; competing adverse risks, including the toxicity of treatment, are not considered . Thus, if the risk of an adverse event is 25%, then 1 in 4 of those who receive the treatment will experience the effect . Clearly, the greater the risk of recurrence the more likely people will be willing to accept toxicity . 
Previous therapy . These may be overcome by using a different formulation of the active ingredient or changing the frequency or time of application . Choice of formulation . Lotions are appropriate for hairy areas . Patient motivation . However, other patients would find this unacceptable . Such variations in patient acceptability should be taken into account when prescribing . According to the classic textbook description, psoriasis does not itch . Keratolytic agents . Topical corticosteroids . Mode of action . However, their precise mode of action is unknown . Topical corticosteroids vary in anti-inflammatory activity . These include . using the least potent corticosteroid required to control disease . applying the agent once daily . Side effects, safety and cosmetic acceptability . Local side effects include . skin atrophy and telangiectasia (usually reversible) . striae (irreversible) (Figure 5.1) . transformation of stable plaque psoriasis to pustular psoriasis . tachyphylaxis (mechanism unknown) . The face and flexures are particularly vulnerable to local problems . Mode of action . inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation . enhancement of normal keratinization . inhibition of accumulation of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils and T lymphocytes . Side effects, safety and cosmetic acceptability . The more recently developed agents, tacalcitol and calcitriol, may be slightly less irritating . Allergic contact dermatitis occasionally complicates the use of these compounds . Coal tar . Coal tar is produced by destructive distillation of coal . Occasionally, higher concentrations are used, but this does not confer any additional therapeutic advantage . Mode of action . In practice, coal tar is rarely used alone . In hospital or day-care settings, this frequently produces long remissions . Side effects, safety and cosmetic acceptability . Staining of skin and clothing precludes the use of crude coal tar at home . Application in the same direction as hair growth and using tar in cream or gel bases may minimize the problem . In addition, tar should not be applied immediately before sun exposure . Dithranol (anthralin) . This is likely to be because of associated skin irritation and staining . Proprietary preparations suitable for home use are also available . Mode of action . This is left in place for up to 24 hours . Side effects, safety and cosmetic acceptability . Inadvertent contact with facial skin, flexural sites and eyes can produce unpleasant burns . No significant long-term toxicity has been identified . Formal comparison with non-proprietary preparations has not been made . Calcineurin inhibitors . It is rarely used in Europe . Mode of action . Tazarotene has the advantage of requiring only once-daily application . Side effects, safety and cosmetic acceptability . The gel is odorless and colorless . Thus, it is important to use moisturizers either before application or after bathing . Guttate psoriasis . Pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis . Both these forms represent extremely unstable and potentially life-threatening diseases . Special sites . Scalp and other hairy areas . Mild-to-moderate scalp psoriasis . Leaving the shampoo on for 10 minutes before rinsing may enhance efficacy . Severe scalp psoriasis . Dithranol can be used to treat resistant scalp psoriasis . Caution must be used in patients with fair or gray hair to prevent staining . Creams should be used rather than ointments . Facial psoriasis . Calcitriol or tacalcitol may also be effective . Side effects include burning and stinging . Flexural sites (inverse psoriasis) . Ears and ear canal . The external auditory meatus and canal may become blocked with retained scale, moisture and secondary infection . Repeated treatments, although painful, are necessary for an optimal and continuous response . 
Integral to all HF management programs are . supervised medical treatment, including drug titration . improved access to care . comprehensive patient education . Most programs involve nurses and physicians specialized in HF . Programs that focus on enhancing patient self-care activities, reduce HF and all-cause hospitalizations but have no effect on mortality . General principles of non-pharmacological management . General non-pharmacological management may be as important as the prescription of HF-specific medications . The majority of HF care is conducted in the home by either the patient and/or the caregiver . Self-care involves active participation in the maintenance and management of HF . Included within self-care maintenance are healthy lifestyle choices, treatment adherence and monitoring of behaviors . Self-care management is a cognitive process that involves the recognition of signs and symptoms of worsening HF, evaluation of the importance of a change in symptoms, implementation of a self-care strategy (such as increasing diuretic medication) and evaluating the effectiveness of any changes . Treatment adherence . Although good adherence to HF management regimens is associated with a decrease in morbidity and mortality, and improvement in wellbeing, only 20-60% of patients with HF adhere to their prescribed medical and non-medical treatment plan . In order to promote increased adherence for patients with HF, the following are recommended . a strong relationship between the healthcare team and patients . Symptom recognition . Weight monitoring, and fluid and sodium management . The maintenance of a normal blood volume is paramount in the management of HF . The management of volume overload in HF patients frequently requires intravenous diuretics and modification to fluid and sodium intake . If patients have demonstrated the ability to self-care, it may be appropriate for them to regulate their own diuretic dose based on daily weight monitoring and assessment of HF symptoms . If there is no change in status the patient should be encouraged to seek the assistance of the healthcare provider or HF nurse . There is no evidence to suggest fluid limitation is useful in patients with mild-to-moderate HF . Multiple factors contribute to physical deconditioning in patients with HF . In general, exercise prescription in patients with HF should include . The importance of warm-up and cool-down periods must be emphasized in patients with HF . Nutrition and weight management . Obesity can increase the risk of developing HF or worsen symptoms . Saturated fat intake should be limited in all patients with HF and especially those who have concomitant coronary heart disease . See Fast Facts: Obesity for more information on weight management . Excessive alcohol intake can be a cause of HF . It has the potential to increase the risk of arrhythmias, increase blood pressure and add to the fluid burden of the HF patient . Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complaint in patients with HF . Therapy should start with optimization of HF . Sildenafil is not currently recommended for patients with severe HF (class III-IV symptoms) and is contraindicated if the patient is using a nitrate preparation . The prevalence of depression in patients with HF is significantly higher than in age- and sex-matched controls; approximately 20% of patients with HF also have depression . Depression is related to a reduction in self-care activities, increased hospitalization and reduced survival . SSRIs can increase sodium levels, so patients should be monitored during active treatment . Immunization has no protective effect in younger patients . Yearly influenza vaccination and vaccination against pneumococcal diseases should be undertaken for patients with symptomatic HF . Travel for patients with HF is possible but complex, and preparation is the key . In general, patients with a commercial driving license and symptomatic HF are banned from driving . Exercise or other functional testing may be required depending on the likely cause of the HF . The resulting hypoxia could have negative cardiovascular consequences in patients with HF . Effects of hypoxia in heart failure . However, in patients with HF, pulmonary vasoconstriction may help protect the pulmonary microvasculature from increased pressure . Passengers with stable chronic HF without recent changes in symptoms or medication are likely to be able to tolerate the mild hypoxia of the aircraft cabin environment even if they have severe HF . Compression stockings have been shown to reduce risk in the non-HF population . 
Common endpoint types are . ordered categorical . time to event . Examples include scales that provide a score for quality of life or severity of depression . Ordered categorical endpoints occur when an outcome is measured in categories and the categories have an implicit order . Time to event . Many endpoints in oncology measure the time to event (see Chapter 2) . Duration of response is an endpoint that is measured from the time of first response to progression . Summary statistics . Summary statistics provide a quick and simple description of a set of data values . It is denoted by x̅ . In these cases, the median is often the preferred measurement . It is sometimes denoted by x̅ . The mode is the most common value (see Figure 1.1) . Comparing the means of binary endpoints makes no sense . Instead, proportions are compared; in this book the symbol r is used to denote a proportion . Standard deviation (SD) is a measure of patient-to-patient variability . It is particularly important in the analysis of continuous and score endpoints . The SD is the average distance of all data values from the mean . SD is most frequently used for data with a symmetric distribution (Figure 1.2) . Sample and population . In general, there are three possible conclusions to be drawn from the results of this type of trial . Different symbols for the statistics of interest are used when considering the complete population . These parameters represent the true values in the population as a whole . Sampling variation . Patients respond differently to treatments . This is referred to as sampling variation and it is ever present in clinical trials . Standard error (SE) is a measure of the extent of the sampling variation . The SD associated with those 100 values is known as the SE . It is a measure of the inherent variability in the statistic being calculated . In practice, of course, the trial cannot be repeated multiple times . Instead, formulas are used to calculate the SE based on the data from a single trial . Confidence intervals . The 95% CI for a treatment difference is given by . These formulas for the CIs are a good approximation in all settings except those with small sample sizes . Hypothesis testing . In statistics, hypotheses are formulated to gain answers to questions of interest . The alternative hypothesis (H) is that they are not equal . Null hypothesis (H): µ = µ . Alternative hypothesis (H): µ ≠ µ . Significance level . The cut-off at 5% is termed the significance level . Two-sided and one-sided p -values . In this scenario, the hypotheses may be set up as follows . Null hypothesis (H): θ <= θ . Alternative hypothesis (H): θ > θ . Odds ratio and relative risk . The OR concept also extends to ordered categorical endpoints . The RR is a similar measure that compares the risks of the binary outcome, rather than the odds . Interpreting OR and RR values . An OR of 1 corresponds to equal treatment effects . If the OR is greater than 1, the odds for the event are higher in the experimental group, and vice versa . Likewise, an RR of 1 corresponds to equal treatment effects . If the RR is greater than 1, the risk is higher in the experimental group, and vice versa . Relative risk reduction and numbers needed to treat . This can be calculated when the RR is less than 1 . The RRR is 1 minus the RR . It is usually expressed as a percentage . NNT is the number of patients who must be treated for one to gain a benefit . When talking about a harm rather than a benefit, this measure is labeled as NNTH . The NNTH is 7.7 . In practice, this is usually rounded up to the nearest whole number, in this case 8 patients . Statistical testing . For comparison of two proportions for a binary endpoint, it is the chi-square test . Normal versus non-normal data distribution . Alternatively, an attempt to recover normality may be made through a data transformation . 
These patients often experience disabling symptoms that lead to poor quality of life and are prone to life-threatening crises . Measuring antibodies . However, it is generally accepted that there is no reliable correlation between serum AChR antibody titers and clinical severity in generalized MG . A recent study using a commercial assay noted a high positive predictive value but a low negative predictive value when correlating titers with several validated outcome measures in MG . The measurement of AChR antibody levels is therefore likely to be of limited benefit when attempting to discern the level of disease activity . Research need . Electrophysiological tests . Clinical rating instruments . The QMG can be completed in 20-30 minutes, and the only specialized equipment required is a spirometer and handheld dynamometer . Spirometry, dynamometry and quantitative timed tests can also be useful longitudinally in individual patients even when the total QMG does not change . The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) task force recommended that the QMG be used in all prospective studies of therapy for MG . Widely used in many studies, the MG-ADL correlates well with the QMG and can serve as a measure of efficacy in clinical trials . No specialized training is required to administer the scale, which can be completed in less than 10 minutes . The MG composite scale (MGC) consists of test items that measure symptoms and signs of MG, with weighted response options to highlight aspects of weakness that may be more serious such as bulbar and respiratory function . It was devised using individual test items taken from existing MG-specific scales based on their performance during two clinical trials of mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of MG . The MGC consists of a combination of physician-measured signs and patient-reported symptoms (Table 4.3) . It is easy to administer, usually taking less than 5 minutes to complete, and covers the ten important functional domains most frequently affected in MG, which have been appropriately weighted; it has been validated . The MG quality of life 15 scale (MG-QOL15) . Measures of health-related quality of life attempt to ascertain a patient's subjective determination of the extent of dysfunction caused by disease and their degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with that dysfunction . MG-QOL15 is a 15-item MG-specific self-administered scale, the test items of which address MG-specific psychological well-being and social functioning . It is meant to inform the treating physician about a particular patient's perception of the extent of dysfunction specifically due to MG, and the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with that dysfunction, which can then be used to help guide treatment decisions . In addition, like the other scales discussed, the MG-QOL15 has served to assist in following groups of patients with MG over time in clinical trials . The scale has been revised using Rasch analysis (MG-QOL15R), which has slightly improved clinimetric properties and improved face and content validity (Table 4.4) . Both scales are validated; however, the MG-QOL15R is preferred given the better content validity and because it is somewhat easier to interpret in the clinical setting . Both scales take less than 5 minutes to administer . The MG impairment index (MGII) was recently developed, importantly taking into account patient input in construction of the scale . Like the MGC, however, several objective examination items were also incorporated into this scale . The MGII was found to have excellent reliability and is easy to implement . MGII scores have been found to correlate well with other validated scales discussed above, including the QMG, MG-ADL, MGC and MG-QOL15 . The PIS should be determined by a clinician skilled in the evaluation of patients with MG since it is based on careful clinical evaluation, taking into account patient-reported symptoms and signs . Monitoring treatment response . The frequency of monitoring will depend on the patient's response to therapy and fluctuations in disease activity . Unstable patients may be assessed every 1-2 months depending on the severity of their symptoms and admitted to hospital if more aggressive treatment, such as plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin, is required . The future . When patients with MG are deemed to be refractory to conventional treatment, aggressive treatments may be needed to improve quality of life, reduce morbidity and prevent life-threatening crises and death . Development of new treatments should be evaluated for these patients in the future . 
Key principles and techniques . Of fundamental importance to the genome editing discipline is the discovery that endogenous DNA repair machinery can be stimulated by the directed induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) . Once made, DSBs activate one of the host cell's two main DNA repair systems: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed recombination (HDR) (Figure 5.1) . The NHEJ pathway operates throughout the cell cycle and repairs DSBs without a template via the typically imprecise direct ligation of broken strand ends . As NHEJ is prone to error, small insertions or deletions (indels) are introduced into the genomic sequence at the DSB site . Following their identification, these endogenous DNA repair mechanisms have been utilized for the purposes of gene editing . Significantly, such genome modification can be carried out in any cell type or organism that possesses the machinery for these repair pathways . As it is such an expansive area, the use of adapted clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated nuclease systems for mammalian genome editing will not be described in this book . The use of MNs for gene editing has shown promise in various studies . A particular strength of MNs is that their small size (they are the smallest of the programmable endonuclease classes) makes their delivery possible with all standard approaches . Zinc finger nucleases . The zinc finger (ZF) domain is a particularly common DNA-binding domain found in the substantial ZF protein class of transcription factors . These domains interact with a 3- or 4-bp DNA sequence via an alpha-helical portion of each finger, while tandem ZFs bind longer target sequences . This 'modular assembly' method utilizes libraries of naturally occurring and engineered ZF domain modules . The nuclease domain of the Fok I restriction endonuclease can function independently from its DNA-binding domain and be fused to ZF domain assemblies . ZFNs operate as dimers, with each ZFN binding opposite DNA strands to introduce a Fok I-induced DSB . Since their development, ZFNs have been used for genome modification via both NHEJ or HDR repair pathways, and positive editing has been achieved in human cells . Transcription activator-like effector nucleases . Individual TALEs recognize DNA bases with a simple one-to-one cipher determining binding specificity - one type of TALE binds to only one DNA base . Each highly conserved TALE repeat binds a specific single DNA base pair, with two hypervariable amino acid residues conveying specificity . Four TALEs specific to different DNA bases can be coupled together in various orders to target diverse but particular DNA sequences . TALENs have been used to efficiently trigger both the NHEJ and HDR pathways in human cells . A further strength is the comparative ease of engineering new arrays when compared with ZFNs and MNs . However, there are significant drawbacks that hamper the utility of the platform, particularly for in vivo delivery . Of further concern is the instability of the tandem repeats that comprise each TALEN monomer, with potential susceptibility to TALE rearrangement and increased difficulty in the viral packaging of repetitive sequences . Target diseases . Deletion of large genomic sequences, even at multiple megabase sizes, can be achieved by the simultaneous generation of two DSBs flanking the target . Disorders where the removal of large genomic sequences may have therapeutic benefit are prospective targets for this approach . Such a repair template should have homology to the break site and the correct sequence in place of the mutant . Therapeutic gene correction approaches have been in development for the repair of mutations causing a range of different human immunodeficiencies, including X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency . For example, attempts utilizing this method have been made to develop HIV therapies combining CCR5 gene knockout with gene insertion of anti-HIV factors . Alternatively, for potential treatment of DMD caused by mutation in the DMD gene whereby one or more exons are deleted, strategies have been developed to insert the missing exons to restore the correct coding sequence and protein function . Insertion into endogenous loci, so expression of the transgene is under the control of the natural promoter, has been investigated as a possible approach for some conditions, including hemophilia B . Examples of gene-editing therapies in development are shown in Table 5.2 . 
Direct questioning may reveal hematuria for 6-12 months prior to presentation . Physical examination is usually unremarkable in cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) unless acute urinary retention is present with bladder distension . A careful pelvic examination in women is equally important . A thorough nodal examination should be undertaken, including the supraclavicular lymph nodes, as well as assessment for hepatic or pulmonary involvement . Detailed investigation . Urinalysis should begin with dipstick testing for the presence of red blood cells . If the result is positive, microscopic analysis should be performed for confirmation . The presence of nitrates or leukocytes should prompt urine culture to look for infection . In the UK, surveillance cystoscopy is usually performed in the outpatient setting using a flexible (diagnostic only) cystoscope . The level of tumor-associated protein appears to correlate directly with increasing stage and grade of tumor . This test may therefore allow serial follow-up of patients, and indicate response to therapy and prognosis for recurring disease . NMP22 ® assay . NMPs are involved in DNA replication and RNA synthesis and are released during cell death and can be detected in the blood and in urine . The test has to be performed in a laboratory . Table 4.1 shows the sensitivity and specificity of some of these markers . Retrograde ureteropyelography should be used to resolve any abnormalities on non-contrast studies . Magnetic resonance urography is another option, particularly for patients with an allergy to iodinated intravenous contrast and for pregnant women . It has 69% sensitivity and 97% specificity for upper-tract tumors . However, if muscle-invasive disease is present, staging with chest, abdominal and pelvic CT is necessary . This should identify any visceral metastatic disease within the limits of resolution of the scanner . Pelvic MRI scanning may give more accurate information about the local spread of an invasive tumor . Bone scans are indicated only for patients with invasive disease who have symptoms suggesting bone involvement (id est pain) or in the presence of elevated bone markers (alkaline phosphatase) . It can usually be accomplished in the ambulatory urology clinic without anesthesia, using a flexible cystoscope . All visible papillary disease should be completely resected in the case of a probable NMIBC . Site-directed biopsy of remote normal-appearing mucosa is indicated only for high-grade tumors . A pelvic examination under general anesthesia prior to resection aids determination of the clinical stage . Maximal resection is desired if radiation-based treatment is being considered for a patient with MIBC . Cytological examination of exfoliated cells is part of the hematuria evaluation for all patients . Cytology is relatively insensitive in low-grade disease . Note that cytological evaluation of urine may be compromised if performed soon after urinary tract instrumentation . Expert pathological interpretation of both histology and cytology specimens is critical . Recent reports indicate a rate of discordance of at least 30% among pathologists, including many who specialize in uropathology . Second-opinion pathology should be routine if the initial reporting pathologist sees only an occasional case of bladder cancer . Transurethral resection of the tumor(s) is the mainstay of both diagnosis and initial management . If papillary disease is limited, as is usually the case, additional therapy may not be required, other than regular cystoscopic surveillance (see page 48) . The use of peri-operative single-dose intravesical chemotherapy is discussed on page 45 . However, extensive resections of large invasive tumors may serve no useful purpose, because cystectomy may be needed shortly . In addition, the risk of postoperative bleeding and clot retention is increased . Deep biopsy at the juncture of the tumor and the muscular wall may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of muscle involvement . Small, obviously low-grade papillary and superficial tumors do not warrant such biopsies, however . Biopsy should be performed under the following circumstances . multiple papillary tumors . tumors that appear solid but are resectable . bladders with erythematous areas that may represent CIS . if chemoradiation with bladder conservation is being considered . 
Tobacco smoke is the most important cause of lung cancer . The number of cigarettes smoked, but more importantly the length of time that patients have smoked for, is proportional to the risk of developing lung cancer . Evidence from the landmark 1964 Surgeon General's report estimated that an average male smoker had a nine- to tenfold increased risk of developing lung cancer compared with a 'never smoker' . For heavy smokers (more than 25 cigarettes per day) the risk is at least 20-fold . Ex-smokers who have quit for more than 15 years show an 80-90% reduction in their risk of lung cancer compared with persistent smokers . The risk reduces by 50% in the first decade and continues to decrease the longer the duration of abstinence . Approximately 1 in 9 smokers develop lung cancer . Individual susceptibility to developing lung cancer is affected by genetic predisposition and other environmental factors . Many occupational exposures increase the risk of developing lung cancer (Table 1.1) . Patients with a first-degree relative with lung cancer have a 50% increased risk of developing lung cancer . The effect is greatest in those with a sibling with lung cancer and is seen regardless of smoking status . Genome-wide association studies have shown that a major susceptibility locus on chromosome 6q (6q23-25p) is associated with increased lung cancer risk . Smoking increases the risk further . It is postulated that mutations in these genes influence lung cancer risk by increasing vulnerability to nicotine addiction . Targeting genetically high-risk individuals for intensive smoking cessation and screening programs may be the focus for future lung cancer prevention strategies . Underlying disease . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with lung cancer risk . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is also associated with a sevenfold increase in lung cancer risk . A meta-analysis of diabetic patients has shown an increased lung cancer risk, especially in women . Previous malignancy . Lung cancer is frequently seen in survivors of previous malignancies, particularly other smoking-related malignancies . Cohort studies have shown increased risk following non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, testicular cancer, uterine sarcomas and head and neck cancers . Patients who have had radiation therapy for thoracic malignancies (exempli gratia lymphomas) are at increased risk of lung cancer; smoking further increases the risk . In patients with breast cancer who have never smoked, postmastectomy radiotherapy is associated with an almost twofold increase in lung cancer risk in the ipsilateral lung but not the contralateral lung . Patients with HIV infection have consistently been shown to have increased rates of lung cancer and are diagnosed at an earlier age . A recent Cochrane review found no evidence that vitamin D supplementation had any effect on lung cancer risk . There is only weak evidence to suggest that high physical activity can reduce the risk of lung cancer . The evidence for a protective effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) on lung cancer risk is inconsistent and limited to case control studies . In around 70% of cases, patients with lung cancer present to secondary care with symptomatic, advanced, incurable disease . Although mass screening of high-risk asymptomatic patients has the potential to detect disease at an earlier stage, randomized trials using chest X-ray (CXR) have not shown a reduction in lung-cancer mortality . Challenges to lung cancer screening are concerns over false positives, complications during diagnostic work-up, patient anxiety and screening cost . Advances in lung cancer screening are likely to involve refining the target population by identifying high-risk groups using risk prediction models such as the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP v2) risk model to identify people with a 5% or greater 5-year risk of developing lung cancer . Verified risk assessment tools (exempli gratia the Brock model) have been shown to be more accurate than clinician assessment at predicting risk of malignancy . For high-risk nodules (> 10% risk of malignancy) greater than 8 mm diameter (or 300 mm volume) a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan can help assess risk of malignancy . High-risk nodules identified on PET should be considered for image-guided or excision biopsy depending on patient fitness and preference . Lower-risk nodules can be followed up with interval LDCT (see page 10) . 
The annual mortality for mild-to-moderate HF (NYHA class II or III) is 24-28%, and increases to 50% in patients with severe NYHA class IV symptoms . Hospital admission with acute HF is a strong and independent predictor of worse prognosis, and is associated with 2-4% in-hospital and 5-15% 90-day mortality . The fact that sudden death can occur at any stage of the disease makes the prognostic process even less predictable . Outcomes are poor when the intensity of HF treatment is low and the patient does not adhere to the medications prescribed . Comorbidities (exempli gratia renal disease, diabetes mellitus), advanced age, male sex and ethnicity all contribute to worse outcomes . Markers of poor prognosis . Several clinical and laboratory markers of poor prognosis have been validated (Table 9.1) . Reversible factors . If any of these problems are identified, prompt and comprehensive treatment should improve HF symptoms, in many cases arrest disease progression and improve prognosis . Palliative care in end-stage heart failure . Palliative care improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness . This is accomplished by the prevention and relief of symptoms, including early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems (Table 9.3) . In general, an illness trajectory for HF can provide a broad estimate of timeframe and help to predict patterns of need and interaction with health and social services (Figure 9.1) . In practical terms advanced HF can be divided into three distinct stages . chronic disease management . palliative and supportive care . terminal care . Chronic disease management strategies include education, monitoring, prevention and effective therapy (see earlier chapters) . They are used to prolong life, prevent HF hospitalization and provide symptomatic relief . Intervention should be delivered using the protocols of locally available HF management programs . Palliative and supportive care may begin following readmission to hospital with HF . Patients and their families or carers may require assistance in negotiating the change in goals of care from prolongation of life to improvement of quality of life by maximizing comfort and dignity . Time should be set aside to discuss the prognosis, course of the illness and palliative-care strategies in detail with the patient and carer . A program of care individualized to the needs of the patient and their family is extremely important . Properly applied, they can cut the overall cost of care by reducing the amount of time patients spend in acute-care settings . Clear communication with community-care providers and family members should always precede any changes in direction or content of care provided by the treating team . Carers should be included in the management plans . Advanced health directive . Recognizing that the outcomes of resuscitation in patients with advanced HF are dismal, individuals should be empowered to express their treatment preferences even when unable to speak for themselves . Medication withdrawal . As the patient's condition deteriorates, the healthcare team should discuss any changes to the goals of medical therapy with the patient and family . This inevitably will include review of the current medical therapy and termination of non-essential drugs . Device deactivation . Automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) have become a common therapeutic option in suitable patients with severe HF . They can help prevent sudden cardiac death, but in advanced HF they can become a potential cause of distress when incessant ventricular rhythms develop . In these circumstances, the patient's quality of life should be paramount, and in many instances deactivation of the device may need to be discussed . To prepare patients and their families for such meetings, many physicians explore these issues at the time of implantation and continue to monitor the patient's status during follow-up visits . If progression to advanced HF becomes clear, it is suggested that discussion regarding deactivation of the ICD function should take place . In many instances the 'not-for-resuscitation' status and arrangements for terminal care are also reviewed at this time (see below) . Therapy for symptom control should continue . The patient's resuscitation status should be reviewed with the patient and carer, and documented . Carers will require increased practical and emotional support, followed by bereavement support . 
In addition, applying topical therapy to the back or to large areas is often impractical . Systemic antibiotics . For more information on duration of treatment see Chapter 8 . Mechanism of action . The availability of these drugs varies in different countries . It is indicated for acne and infectious diseases . Resistance of P . The advised dosage is 300-600 mg daily for 12 weeks . The incidence of P . Lymecycline may sometimes induce gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, stomach ache and dysphagia . Administration after a meal may solve the problem . Rarely, diarrhea and allergic rashes may occur . It is available in doses of 50 and 100 mg; the most frequent prescriptions are 100 and 200 mg daily . In the USA, a new weight-related formulation with five different dosages is available . The duration of treatment ranged from less than 1 week to 1 year . First-generation tetracyclines . As a result, patient adherence is very low . The second-generation tetracyclines described above are largely preferable to the first-generation ones . The capsules should be taken with a full glass of water . They should not be taken just before lying down or at bedtime . These products are therefore best taken 2 hours before or after the prescribed antibiotic . Tetracyclines also pass into breast milk and are therefore not suitable for breast-feeding mothers . Side effects . Vaginal candidiasis may be experienced and can be a problem, whether sexually active or not . The interaction of oral contraceptives and long-term antibiotics has been a matter of concern . The use of macrolides is limited by the rapid development of bacterial resistance . acnes resistance is much more common . Generally it is given in 500 mg, twice daily doses . The most common adverse effect is gastrointestinal irritation . Optimizing oral antibiotic therapy . Principles for the optimum use of oral antibiotics are discussed on pages 91-4 . Hormonal therapy . combined oral contraceptives . cyproterone acetate . Combined oral contraceptives . Ethinyl estradiol (EE) is the most commonly used estrogen . Evidence of efficacy . The most recent Cochrane review, which included 31 clinical trials involving 12 579 participants, made 24 comparisons . Unfortunately, many biases have been demonstrated in these studies . Expected response . Side effects . In 2011, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued the following position statements . Cyproterone acetate is a progestin with antiandrogen activity that blocks androgen receptors . Dosage and response . CPA is available in Europe and Canada but not in the USA . Usually it is included in a combination with EE (see above) . Side effects . Spironolactone is a synthetic steroidal derivative of aldosterone with anti-aldosterone activity . It functions both as an androgen-receptor blocker and inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase . Dosage and response . The dose can be increased if the patient has no significant breast tenderness or headache . Effective maintenance doses are in the range of 25-50 mg/day . Evidence of efficacy . Increased potassium levels may occur in up to 15% of cases but they do not generally reach clinical relevance . Postural hypertension has been described in young females . Systemic retinoids . Isotretinoin reduces comedogenesis, and lowers ductal and surface P . It also demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity . There are a variety of approaches to therapy with this drug . Longer treatment periods are sometimes required . As a result, the prevalence and severity of flare-ups dropped significantly . Side effects . Education regarding teratogenicity and the need for contraception and adherence to a pregnancy prevention program are essential . Patients should be advised to use both a hormonal and barrier contraceptive . Cheilitis and dry skin are the most common dose-related adverse effects . Isotretinoin may reduce the thickness of the stratum corneum . Adequate management of dosage, sun exposure and use of sunscreens may solve the problem . 
It can sometimes be difficult for pathologists to distinguish DLBCL from Burkitt lymphoma . Left untreated, these tumors can rapidly be fatal . Treatment aims to provide a cure . Relapse is associated with a poor prognosis . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . While there are a few recurring cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, they are not particularly helpful diagnostically (Table 5.1) . The condition may present at any age, but is increasingly common in later life . There is substantial evidence that the molecular subtype has prognostic significance . The ABC subtype has been found to confer a worse prognosis . Clinical presentation . Clinically, there are some important considerations . About 50% of all cases involve extranodal sites . DLBCLs are aggressive, but approximately 50% are curable with combination chemotherapy . 5% will relapse in the central nervous system (CNS) . Management of DLBCL, as with all lymphomas, starts with staging (see Chapter 4) . Staging investigations include . bone-marrow biopsy . complete blood count, renal and liver profile, and immunoglobulins . lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) . virology, which should include hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV . Prognosis can be usefully predicted using the International Prognostic Index (IPI) . Patients are divided into four outcome groups depending on their score (Table 5.2) . low risk . low-intermediate risk . high-intermediate risk . high risk . This defines three prognostic groups (Table 5.3) . Prospective confirmation of these data is awaited . The standard treatment for DLBCL is six courses of R-CHOP given every 21 days . Subsequent trials extended this observation to younger patients . Some centers will use adjunctive radiotherapy . Refractory disease . Treatment according to subtype . Emerging data suggest that different treatment approaches should be considered depending on the molecular subtype of DLBCL . Follow-up . Patients who are in complete remission can be followed up in an outpatient clinic . Many centers now discharge patients after 5 years . Relapse or progressive disease . Salvage protocols vary, but are usually based on regimens containing platinum . The following salvage/relapse regimens are used . R-DHAP and R-ESHAP are similar regimens given by infusion over 5 days . Occasionally, radiotherapy provides excellent symptomatic relief for localized disease . Central nervous system prophylaxis . CNS involvement is a rare but devastating complication of DLBCL . or disease that involves the facial bones and surrounding structures . Burkitt lymphoma . Burkitt lymphoma is a rare and important disease with a distinctive immunophenotype and cytogenetics . It can often be cured with aggressive sequential chemotherapy . Burkitt lymphoma is probably the most aggressive tumor affecting humans . Every cell is undergoing cell division, leading to potentially devastating presentations with huge tumor burdens . There are three main types . endemic Burkitt lymphoma, which is almost always associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection . Burkitt lymphoma associated with HIV . A characteristic feature of Burkitt lymphoma is a very high proliferation rate, usually close to a 100% . Occasional cases of DLBLC will exhibit a similar high rate so this finding is not in itself diagnostic . The immunophenotype is one of a mature GCB phenotype expressing CD19, CD20 and CD10 . This places MYC under the control of the immunoglobulin gene enhancer, which drives expression . Clinical presentation . Occasionally, patients will present with florid leukemia . Full staging is mandatory and should include analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid . Burkitt lymphoma requires treatment with high-dose sequential chemotherapy . Phrenic nerve palsy or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy may occur as a direct result of local tissue invasion . Whether the addition of radiotherapy to the mediastinum at the completion of chemotherapy confers survival advantage is controversial . 
Types of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting . Five categories are used to classify CINV (Figure 2.1) . Nausea and vomiting may occur any time after the administration of chemotherapy, but the mechanisms appear different for CINV that occurs in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy compared with CINV that occurs 1-5 days after chemotherapy (Table 2.1) . Acute CINV is nausea and/or vomiting that occurs within the first 24 hours of chemotherapy administration . It can start within 1 or 2 hours of chemotherapy being administered and can last for several hours, with maximal intensity 5-6 hours after drug administration . The incidence (see page 19), severity and quantity of acute emesis and/or nausea varies depending on several treatment-related factors including the emetogenicity and dosage of the chemotherapy (see Chapter 4) and a number of patient-related factors (see Risk factors below) . Delayed CINV is arbitrarily defined as nausea and/or vomiting that develops more than 24 hours after chemotherapy administration . It is important to emphasize that there is no clear break for when acute CINV ends and delayed CINV starts and the definitions for both should be considered an approximation . Delayed CINV is typically associated with the administration of cisplatin, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide and can occur days 2 to 7 after chemotherapy . It can persist for as long as 5-7 days, with maximal intensity 48-72 hours after drug administration . Other predictive factors include the dose and the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agent (see Chapter 4), patient sex and age, and protection against nausea and vomiting in previous cycles of chemotherapy . For cisplatin, which has been most extensively studied, delayed emesis reaches peak intensity 2-3 days after chemotherapy administration and can last up to a week if not treated . Breakthrough CINV is vomiting and/or nausea that occurs within 5 days of chemotherapy despite appropriate guideline-directed use of prophylactic antiemetic agents . This type of CINV usually requires immediate treatment or 'rescue' treatment with additional antiemetics . Refractory CINV is vomiting and/or nausea that occurs after chemotherapy in subsequent chemotherapy cycles when guideline-directed antiemetic prophylaxis and/or rescue treatment have failed in earlier cycles . Patients who experience CINV may develop a conditioned response known as anticipatory nausea and/or vomiting before the administration of chemotherapy in future chemotherapy cycles . This is attributed to the adverse memory of previous CINV . Incidence rates for this type of nausea and vomiting range from 10% to 45%, with nausea occurring more frequently . Anticipatory CINV can be triggered by a variety of tastes, odors, sights, thoughts or anxiety associated with the chemotherapy treatment . It is more challenging to control and treat than acute or delayed CINV . Risk factors . Risk factors for CINV include features of the treatment itself as well as a number of patient characteristics . Treatment risk factors . The potential for CINV may be influenced by the following features of the chemotherapy being administered . the doses of chemotherapy administered (see Table 4.3, page 59) . the combination of chemotherapy agents . Patient characteristics also influence the potential for CINV (Table 2.2) . Young women with a history of motion sickness, emesis during pregnancy and no history of alcohol consumption have the highest risk of developing significant CINV . Incidence in high-risk patients . Despite the use of guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics, CINV can occur with relatively high frequency in high-risk patients (20-25% acute, 50-70% delayed, 50% breakthrough and 30% refractory) . Patients who are scheduled to receive their first course of chemotherapy should be individually evaluated for their specific risk factors and prescribed appropriate antiemetics (see Chapter 7) . Treatment effectiveness . The use of antiemetic agents, as recommended by international guidelines, has been shown to prevent emesis in approximately 50-70% of patients receiving either highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy . New agents and new combinations of agents are necessary to adequately prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea . Although the onset and duration of symptoms usually points to chemotherapy as the cause, other potential aggravating factors that may cause nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer should be considered (Table 2.3) . 
Patients with stage I grade 2 disease are sometimes excluded from adjuvant treatment, and the number of cycles prescribed is sometimes reduced in such cases . At least 6 cycles of chemotherapy are routinely recommended in patients with stage II disease and beyond (Figure 6.1) . Adjuvant approaches that are considered to be within current standards of care include . 'standard chemotherapy': platinum-based therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) administered intravenously every 3 weeks . 'dose-dense' chemotherapy: a platinum agent administered intravenously every 3 weeks with a weekly taxane . neoadjuvant chemotherapy . standard chemotherapy with the addition of bevacizumab . The choice of therapy depends on the physician, and is often tailored to the characteristics of the patient . The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is the current standard of care for first-line chemotherapy in ovarian cancer . Adjuvant versus neoadjuvant therapy . As shown in Figure 6.2, the first treatment decision for patients with ovarian cancer is the timing of surgery . The advantages of this approach include . removing the symptomatic tumor . avoiding the theoretical concern of possibly inducing resistant clones by exposing large-volume tumors to chemotherapy . However, other clinicians support the routine use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereby chemotherapy is started after the diagnosis is established by biopsy, and surgery is performed after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy have been administered . Two landmark Phase III trials have shown that interval cytoreduction after initial chemotherapy is a viable option in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer . The experimental group received platinum-based neoadjuvant therapy, followed by interval debulking surgery and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy; the control group received primary debulking surgery followed by at least 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy . The second study (CHORUS) assigned 276 patients to primary surgery and 274 to primary chemotherapy . Median OS was 22.6 months in the surgery group compared with 24.1 months in the chemotherapy group (HR for death 0·87 in favor of primary chemotherapy; 95% CI 0·72-1·05) . Grade 3/4 postoperative adverse events and deaths within 28 days of surgery were more common in the surgery group than in the chemotherapy group (adverse events: 24% versus 14%, p = 0.0007; deaths: 6% versus < 1%, p = 0·001) . The most common grade 3/4 postoperative adverse event in both groups was hemorrhage (3% versus 6% in the surgery and chemotherapy groups, respectively) . Overall, 49% of women receiving primary surgery and 40% of those receiving primary chemotherapy had a grade 3/4 chemotherapy-related adverse event, mostly uncomplicated neutropenia (20% and 16%, respectively) . The authors concluded that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not inferior to primary debulking surgery, and that administration of chemotherapy before surgery is an acceptable standard of care for women with advanced ovarian cancer . Choice of adjuvant therapy regimen . Dose-dense regimens . However, some investigators have explored a 'dose-dense' approach, whereby higher doses are administered over a shorter period of time . Neuropathy and hair loss were reduced in the dose-dense or weekly approach . More recently, the GOG262 study, which explored the dose-dense approach versus 3-weekly paclitaxel with the option of bevacizumab administration, showed no advantage in terms of PFS with dose-dense therapy; however, in a post hoc analysis of the group who opted not to receive bevacizumab (approximately 15% of the population), there was a statistically significant difference in PFS favoring dose-dense chemotherapy . Concomitant anti-angiogenesis treatment . Intraperitoneal chemotherapy . Increased toxicity is an important concern in patients receiving IP chemotherapy . patient characteristics (age, performance status, comorbidities, etc . The key data and other considerations shaping the choice between regimens are depicted in Figure 6.3 . Future trials exploring long-term efficacy and toxicity in addition to patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life, are likely to further clarify the value of each regimen . In addition, future trials will examine novel combinations of targeted agents with traditional chemotherapy . 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) become more frequent with increasing age and have a male predominance (male:female ratio of 2.1:1) . Survival may also be worse with increasing age, which may reflect reduced innate immunity . Incidence also increases with age . Most patients with MF present with early-stage disease characterized by a long disease course but substantial morbidity (pain, pruritus, scaling), and cosmetic disfigurement may be considerable . Thirty percent of patients with MF and all those with Sézary syndrome (SS) present with advanced-stage disease, and in addition 25% with early MF will progress to advanced disease . Staging alongside identification of the good/poor prognostic factors will enable more aggressive subtypes that require more aggressive medical intervention to be identified and treated appropriately . The revised TNMB staging system . The Mycosis Fungoides Cooperative Group staging system was developed in the 1970s and was the preferred staging system for over 25 years . A revised system (Table 5.1) was proposed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma (ISCL) and the Cutaneous Lymphoma Task Force of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) . This revised staging introduced a blood classification (B0-2) alongside the conventional tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) categories . Stages IA-IIA are considered early-stage disease and IIB-IVB advanced stage . Patients with early-stage disease tend to have a favorable prognosis of more than a decade and are managed with skin-directed therapy or a 'wait and see'/'expectant' approach . Patients with late-stage disease tend to have an aggressive clinical course and typically need systemic therapy . Cutaneous lymphomas other than MF/SS are classified separately using a TNM system; however, this staging system has not been validated prospectively for prognosis . 'Skin scoring' . The current T class does not reflect the skin tumor burden . A crude distinction between stage T1 and T2 disease is dependent on involvement of more than 10% of body surface area, while T4 is defined as more than 80% involvement . In T3 there is no minimum body surface area involvement and the presence of one tumor of more than 1 cm diameter defines disease . Use of the modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) provides additional information to staging in MF/SS . The mSWAT calculates the amount of body surface area covered by each type of MF/SS lesion (patch, plaque, tumor) in each of 12 areas of the body (head, neck, anterior trunk, arms, forearms, hands, posterior trunk, buttocks, thighs, legs, feet, groin), and then applies a weighting factor (x1, plaque x2, tumor x4) to produce a numerical value out of a total of 400 . While there are always problems with any type of scoring system, the mSWAT score allows disease tumor burden to be accurately recorded to assess responses to treatment, and is useful in clinical trials . Patient survival according to stage of disease was reported in a recent London cohort of more than 1500 patients . Early-stage disease (IA-IIA) had a long median survival of 16-35 years and 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) of 89-98% (Table 5.2) . Signs in early-stage disease that indicated a better prognosis in this and other studies included presenting at a young age, poikiloderma, hypopigmentation and the association of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) . Signs associated with a worse prognosis included male sex, plaques, folliculotropism and enlarged lymph nodes . A large international multicenter study of 1275 patients with advanced-stage MF/SS reported survival of 63 months, with 2- and 5-year survival rates of 77% and 52%, respectively . Each parameter was recorded at diagnosis and tested against overall survival . Four independent prognostic markers were found for worse survival: stage IV disease, age greater than 60 years, large cell transformation and increased LDH . Combining these four factors in a prognostic index model identified the following three risk groups across stages with significantly different 5-year survival rates: low risk (68%), intermediate risk (44%) and high risk (28%) . This prognostic model may be used to stratify patients with advanced-stage disease who require more aggressive treatments . 
It is important to establish . how far the tumor has spread . The goals of treatment can be to . achieve cure for the individual patient . prevent or delay recurrence for as long as possible . Rationale for local treatment . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy . The aim of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is . determine the pathological stage of lymph-node involvement . Simple mastectomy . Samples from the lowest axillary lymph nodes are usually also taken . Modified radical mastectomy . Subcutaneous mastectomy . The breast can then be reconstructed immediately with an implant . Skin-sparing mastectomy . The most common complication after surgery is wound infection . Common complications are listed in Table 5.2 . Conservative procedures include . quadrantectomy, in which an entire quadrant is removed (Figure 5.2) . young age (< 30 or < 40) . diffuse microcalcifications . tumor close to the nipple . more than one tumor . extensive intraductal component or vascular invasion . lobular histology . unfavorable biology . Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy . Ideally, there should be more than one consultation with the surgeon and ideally also with the radiation oncologist . Treatment of regional lymph nodes . Radiotherapy to intramammary nodes . Intraoperative assessment of the lymph node is possible with imprint cytology . If positive, formal axillary dissection is justified . However, long-term local recurrence results are yet to be reported . Expertise and experience in the sentinel node procedure are implicit requirements . The temptation to use the technique in every case should be avoided . the morbidity of axillary clearance in general and in the hands of the surgeon . Reconstructive surgery . The aims of reconstructive surgery are to . restore the natural breast contour as far as possible . establish symmetry between the new mound and the remaining breast . produce a pleasing nipple-areola complex . Immediate versus delayed reconstruction . Reconstruction options . A number of options for breast reconstruction are available . silicone gel implants . tissue expanders and prostheses . myocutaneous flaps . latissimus dorsi . transverse rectus abdominis . deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap . The implant is placed high on the chest wall, beneath the pectoralis major muscle . There is no scientific evidence that silicone implants are associated with any health hazard, including autoimmune disease . Newer implants are of higher quality and have lower incidence of capsular contracture or rupture . Tissue expanders . The bag is then removed and replaced with a silicone implant in a second operation . Myocutaneous flaps . This technique involves using a flap of skin and muscle to recreate the breast mound . Deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap . Research into sensory innervation of such a breast is ongoing . Nipple reconstruction . If desired, the nipple can be reconstructed surgically to give a reasonable cosmetic appearance . Other cosmetic operations . lymph-node involvement, who have not undergone full axillary clearance . involvement of the pectoralis major muscle . Treatment is normally given in 3-5-weekly sessions for up to 6 weeks . Cardiac side effects can be significant, although modern treatment approaches yield fewer complications . This is consistent with the results in the TARGIT-A trial (see below) . Hypofractionated radiotherapy . It has been developed over the past 15 years and is being tested in randomized trials . This biological rationale is perhaps borne out in the clinic . It is also significantly less expensive for the healthcare system . An iPhone App to assist case selection for TARGIT is available at . The MammoSite technique uses a balloon catheter inserted in the site to deliver brachytherapy . All these techniques offer different advantages, and the results of randomized trials should guide clinicians' choices . 
For red eye due to trauma (including corneal foreign body), see Chapter 11 . 'Bad' red eye . there is no pain, photophobia or blurred vision . both eyes are otherwise completely normal on examination . You can assess these patients for treatment yourself, or refer non-urgently to an ophthalmologist . The underlying cause could be viral, allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis, dry eyes or blepharitis . Prescribing eye drops . 'Safe' topical treatment . Don't ever prescribe the following eye drops . topical anesthetic drops - these can lead to blindness (neurotrophic ulcer, corneal melts and perforated globes) . topical steroid-containing drops - these can worsen corneal infections, accelerate cataract formation and raise intraocular pressure with glaucoma . Antibiotic eye drops should only be prescribed for bacterial conjunctivitis, which presents as . two 'good' red eyes . a pus-like discharge . no pain or photophobia, and normal vision . If referral is delayed, even by a few days, permanent visual loss can occur . The pupil may look normal, be irregular or be distorted . This disease can only be diagnosed by testing the eye's intraocular pressure with a tonometer . Acute glaucoma is more common in longsighted elderly women . Infective corneal ulcer . The cornea is normally completely clear, but in cases of infective corneal ulcer it is infiltrated by a virus, bacterium or fungus . If severe, hypopyon (a fluid pus level in the inferior part of the anterior chamber) may be visible . Vision can be normal or blurred . On examination, the sclera appears diffusely or focally red . The condition is often associated with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic vasculitis . Bacterial conjunctivitis almost always affects both eyes, although it can be briefly unilateral . The eyes are red, gritty and sticky, with a pus-like discharge (Figure 2.7) . Lid eversion may show papillae (small, pink, cobblestone-like lumps) . There is no need to take a microbiology swab . Treat with a topical antibiotic every 2 hours during the day for several days until improvement occurs, then four times a day for a week . Warn the patient that the condition is contagious . One or both eyes become red, and there is a clear watery discharge, without pus . Lid eversion can reveal follicles, which look like small gray grains of rice (Figure 2.8) . Pre-auricular or cervical lymphadenopathy may or may not be present . No treatment is of benefit and the infection will resolve with time . Warn the patient that the infection is highly contagious until the redness has subsided . The predominant symptom is itching of one or both eyes . If the patient wears contact lenses, they should see their contact lens prescriber for a check-up . If not, prescribe mast-cell inhibitor drops to see whether they help . Warn the patient that they may need to use the drops for several weeks before they notice any improvement . Subconjunctival hemorrhage is usually spontaneous but can occur after a severe bout of coughing . There is no significant itch or discharge; the redness is more often focal than diffuse . No treatment is necessary unless the redness persists or worsens, in which case referral is appropriate . Dry eyes are the most common cause of a sensation of dryness, grittiness or burning . Patients may complain of a chronic foreign body sensation - 'There is always something in my eyes' . The eyes often look completely normal or are mildly red . Refer routinely if these lubricating treatments do not help . The eyes themselves may look normal or slightly red . The eyelid margins appear slightly reddened and thickened, often with crusting or matting of the eyelashes (Figure 2.12) . There are 'lid care' kits available from pharmacies that are specifically for cleaning the lid margins in patients with blepharitis . These can be a convenient treatment should time be limited in the morning! Refer routinely if these measures do not help . 
Monoclonal antibodies . Anti-CD20 . Monoclonal antibody therapies that target the CD20 cell surface molecule include rituximab (chimeric), ocrelizumab (humanized) and ofatumumab (human) . These treatments induce prolonged depletion of B-cell precursors, while sparing mature plasma cells . Rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have dramatically suppressed MRI activity in Phase II and III (ocrelizumab) studies compared with placebo . Rituximab is often used off-label for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica, an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS with a convincing humoral (antibody-mediated) pathogenesis . The trial investigators have suggested that better patient selection (exempli gratia younger patients with signs of inflammation in the brain) may improve outcomes . Ofatumumab also binds to CD20, but in a different region of the CD20 receptor to that of ocrelizumab and rituximab . It has shown high efficacy, including a significant reduction in the number of gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions . Trials in MS are ongoing . Anti-CD25 . Daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to the cell surface molecule CD25, impairs the proliferation of autoreactive T cells, while expanding some natural killer (NK) cell populations . Daclizumab reduces the risk and severity of rejection in human organ transplantation . The mechanism of action in MS is unknown, but a regulatory effect on the immune system, mediated by NK cells, has been postulated . In a Phase IIb trial (CHOICE), subcutaneously administered daclizumab reduced the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions by 72% versus placebo at the higher of two doses . A second Phase III trial is under way and will be completed in 2019 . Safety data from both the MS clinical trial program and the transplant literature are promising; transient thrombocytopenia, rash, autoimmune cutaneous reaction, lymphadenopathy and liver dysfunction have been reported . There were four deaths in the DECIDE control group and one in the active treatment group; all were thought to be unrelated to treatment . Laquinimod, a novel synthetic derivative of quinoline-3-carboxamide, is given once daily as oral therapy . Laquinimod has exhibited some concerning side effects in the clinical trial program to date: elevation of liver enzymes and an increase in cardiovascular events . Stem cell therapy . Dramatic MRI responses to AHSCT have also been reported . There is no evidence that immunoablative therapy will be efficacious in gradually progressive forms of MS . International multicenter clinical trials are ongoing, which should help to define a population of patients in whom the risk-benefit analysis weighs in favor of this treatment approach . Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation . Mesenchymal tissue can be harvested from bone marrow, placental or adipose tissue, and multipotent mesenchymal stem cells expanded and purified in vitro . Evidence from preclinical studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models supports both an immunomodulatory and neuroprotective role for mesenchymal stem cells . Experimental (Phase I/II) studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in humans, with no serious adverse reactions reported to date . The capacity of these cells to differentiate into physiologically functional neural tissue (remyelination/regeneration) is yet to be determined . Anti-LINGO-1 . Promoting repair has been an unexplored sphere of MS therapy . Recently, in animal models of demyelination, LINGO antagonists have been shown to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination in vitro . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Mastinib targets mast cells and inhibits several biochemical processes . It is used in the treatment of canine diseases and is also being evaluated in stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease . Sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) receptor inhibitors . Multiple S1P receptor inhibitors are in Phase III development . S1P receptor products in Phase III studies include ponesimod, siponomod and ozanimod . 
This should, in turn, aid the development of novel precise mechanistic-based treatment strategies . Tissue-based molecular studies . NGS research studies have identified distinct mutational signatures in AITL and Tfh-related lymphomas, and recurrent mutations in other PTCL subtypes (see Chapter 2) . However, most studies have used targeted NGS or WES, providing only a limited view of the PTCL genome . Integrated multiomic analysis . The biology of PTCL is likely to extend beyond aberrations in the genetic sequence . Transcriptomic, epigenetic, methylation and metabolomic programs are likely to be key cellular drivers of PTCL . The integration of sequencing data with multiomic analysis is likely to be critical in identifying vulnerabilities for drug targeting . Such analysis will be particularly relevant for PTCL cases in which current sequencing strategies do not detect a recurrent mutation . Challenges to molecular studies . Some subtypes of PTCL, particularly AITL, are characterized by a heavy stromal infiltrate with low tumor burden, rendering bulk sequencing relatively insensitive . Moreover, studies in other cancers have demonstrated significant intratumor heterogeneity, suggesting that single-site biopsies may fail to capture the global tumor mutational composition, representing a major barrier to genomic-driven treatment strategies . Blood-based sequencing assays . A potential solution to many of the challenges of tissue-based molecular studies is to use peripheral blood as a source of tumor DNA . Tumor DNA may be released into the circulation by dying cancer cells, or actively secreted . Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers a non-invasive way to determine tissue mutational status, assess global tumor heterogeneity and track tumor evolution in real time through serial sampling . The use of ctDNA in PTCL is being studied in several countries . Single cell analysis . Bulk analysis generates an average profile of the whole cell population, including malignant and non-malignant cells, which does not adequately capture the complexity of a tumor and risks missing treatment-resistant subclones that will ultimately germinate relapse . However, technological developments enabling single cell analysis are allowing researchers to deconvolute bulk tumors and analyze cancers with greater resolution and accuracy (Figure 8.1) . Single cell RNA and DNA sequencing can determine cancer evolution, provide insight into tumor heterogeneity and segregate and characterize stromal cells . Given that bulk sequencing of PTCL cases to date has been relatively insensitive, single cell analysis is likely to significantly advance our understanding of PTCL biology . Advances in the treatment of PTCL have been significantly hampered by the paucity of relevant preclinical models . Only a relatively small number of PTCL cell lines are available, many of which are poorly characterized and are of limited value to preclinical testing . There is also a lack of genetically engineered mouse models that faithfully reflect human PTCL . Recent initiatives generating patient-derived xenograft PTCL models may facilitate discoveries into PTCL biology and the development of novel treatment strategies . Novel treatment strategies . A plethora of new drugs are being developed, including monoclonal antibodies against T-cell receptors, cytokines, and chemokines, small molecular inhibitors that target key T-cell pathways, and agents that reverse epigenetic dysregulation . Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy represents a novel treatment strategy that may prove transformative across PTCL subtypes, as in other hematologic malignancies . Peripheral blood T cells apheresed from patients are engineered to express a modified antigen receptor that recognizes a cancer target (Figure 8.2) . Upon engagement with the target cell, activation of CAR T cells triggers cytotoxicity of the cancer cell . CAR T cells have been developed for CD4, CD5, CD7 and CD30 . An alternative approach is to develop CAR products against the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRB) . There is also uncertainty about tumor escape mechanisms . Current research in specific PTCL subtypes . A recent study has provided further support for two major biological and prognostic subgroups based on cell of origin: PTCL-GATA-3 and PTCL-TBX21 (see page 21) . The cell of origin has been identified as an intraepithelial innate lymphoid cell, a recently described heterogeneous immune subset . This insight is likely to precipitate further research and identify new drug targets . 
Providing patients with information about osteoarthritis (OA) and its treatment is an essential first step . Rheumatology societies in most countries provide easy-to-read brochures or booklets on OA that can be given to patients at consultations . Some data suggest that both individualized education strategies and group education may improve patient symptoms . It is important to review a patient's work and social life to identify any activities that may aggravate pain and/or place them at risk of injury . For example, patients who present with knee pain who have difficulty putting on shoes and socks, may have referred pain from the hip, and hip pathology should be considered . As might be expected, these programs have small effect sizes on physical outcomes, but moderate effects on psychosocial outcomes in OA . The benefits of exercise may be mediated through different routes, including increased strength and endurance, weight reduction, more accurate proprioception and joint position sense, improvement in comorbidities and reduction in anxiety or depression . Numerous studies have examined the benefits of exercise for OA of the knee and a few studies have assessed the benefits of exercise for OA of the hip . On balance, these studies show that therapeutic exercise brings about a moderate reduction in pain and some improvement in function, although the nature of the exercise differs between studies . It appears that benefits arise from individual programs and group classes and from exercises performed at home . Not surprisingly, the benefits of exercise may not be sustained for more than a few months if the exercises are not continued; it is therefore important to consider not only patient adherence but also the longer-term use of strategies such as an intermittent overview by a physical therapist to encourage ongoing exercise . Exercise for OA patients may take two main forms . Patients may not be able to undertake aerobic fitness training until they have sufficiently strengthened local muscles . A range of effective exercises is available to help reduce OA knee symptoms, including both strengthening exercises and aerobic walking . Such exercises should be tailored to the individual . It should be noted that patients with fixed-flexion deformities of the knee will have difficulties with exercises . One simple exercise for quadriceps strengthening is demonstrated in Figure 7.1 . The patient lies on a flat surface and bends up the non-exercising leg (to take some strain off the lower back and hips) . The knee to be exercised is extended fully and pushed down toward the bed or supporting surface . The patient can be asked to pull their toes back at the same time, which adds a hamstring stretch to this exercise . With the knee fully extended the patient then lifts the leg for a count of 10-20 seconds . However, not uncommonly, a patient may not be able to do this straight-leg raise off the bed, in which case it may be useful to start with an 'inner-range' quadriceps exercise using a rolled-up towel placed directly under the affected knee . For patients who are this weak, another helpful exercise may be walking laps in a swimming pool . This exercise may also be helpful for hip pain (due to true hip OA or trochanteric bursitis), where weak quadriceps will contribute to abnormal biomechanical load . A lateral leg raise may also be helpful for hip problems . Here the person lies on their side and lifts the leg to be exercised toward the ceiling for a count of 10-20 seconds (Figure 7.2) . walking laps in a swimming pool . cycling on an exercise bike, although this may be limited by the degree of patellofemoral disease . Recent work suggests that the combination of dietary weight loss and an exercise class can result in significant long-term reduction of pain and improvement in physical function in patients who are overweight . Similarly, there is conflicting evidence regarding the usefulness of insoles for reducing knee pain, such as the lateral wedge insole for medial tibiofemoral OA . A splint for the first carpometacarpal joint may be useful in patients who have OA at the base of the thumb . Complex neurophysiological mechanisms have been suggested in an attempt to explain its mechanism of action, which may be partially mediated through patient-provider interactions . No good clinical trial evidence exists to support the use of these therapies for OA, and little is known of their potential toxicity . There remains significant controversy regarding the role of these medications in OA management . Many randomized controlled trials have compared glucosamine with placebo in patients with OA of the knee and/or hip . 
Rarely, however, serious disease can present as an eyelid abnormality . You can treat patients with the following conditions yourself, but refer them if the problem persists or worsens . preseptal cellulitis (in a non-febrile adult) . Eyelid redness and swelling . It is essential to differentiate orbital cellulitis from preseptal cellulitis . Fortunately, it is usually possible to make the distinction between the two conditions on clinical grounds . Orbital cellulitis . Orbital cellulitis may be mimicked by several other conditions, all of which are also serious (exempli gratia carotid-cavernous fistula) . Broad-spectrum oral antibiotics such as flucloxacillin plus amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are often first-line treatments . Mild allergic reactions are treated with oral antihistamines . Patients with anaphylactic reactions or nephrotic syndrome require urgent care from the relevant specialist physicians . Abnormal eyelid position or function . Lid retraction, in which the upper eyelid is too high, occurs most commonly as a result of thyroid eye disease (see Chapter 7) . Corrective surgery is possible . In adults with ptosis, the prime concern is to exclude any serious underlying cause; once this has been achieved surgery can be performed . The lower lid hangs away from the eye and can cause chronic irritation and watering . Patients with ectropion should be referred routinely for corrective surgery . Patients with mild ectropion and mild discomfort can be treated with ocular lubricants if they do not wish to have surgery . The lower eyelid rolls inwards, which sometimes causes the eyelashes to abrade the cornea and create foreign body sensation . If severe, this can cause a corneal ulcer . Blepharospasm is an intermittent or constant eyelid spasm that results in too much eyelid closure . All these patients should see an ophthalmologist to rule out an ocular or neurological cause for the spasm . Many patients benefit from botulinum toxin injections to relax the contracting muscles . Skin rashes around the eye . If the rash involves the tip of the nose, there is an increased incidence of eye involvement . (The nasociliary branch of the trigeminal nerve supplies both the cornea and the tip of the nose . Neuralgic pain, which may be persistent and severe, is common after the rash resolves . (Post-herpetic neuralgia can be controlled by medication, and this should be offered to these patients . Other periorbital rashes . Patients may develop contact allergic rashes to eye drops or makeup . Generalized skin disease (exempli gratia atopic eczema) may also involve the periorbital area . Inflammatory lumps . Chalazia are usually associated with blepharitis, which should also be treated . These lumps almost always go away with time, but if they are large and persistent they can be surgically treated . Removal of the offending lash may cure the problem . If localized skin redness occurs a short course of oral antibiotics may be given . External hordeolum is a hordeolum of hair follicles that usually has its leading edge pointing externally to the eyelid . Eyelid abscess . Eyelid abscesses require urgent surgical drainage . Dacryocystitis is not really an eyelid lump, but is discussed here because it presents as a mass close to the lower lid . Dacryocystitis is due to infection of an obstructed lacrimal sac . Urgent ophthalmic referral is required . Benign lid tumors include squamous papillomas (small, warty-looking lumps that are sometimes pedunculated) and compound nevi . Malignant lid tumors include basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and malignant melanoma . Melanoma is even more dangerous because it often metastasizes . It is the second most common malignant eyelid tumor but ten times less common than a BCC . Eyelid lumps . An early referral with appropriate treatment could prevent a large area of resection and cosmetic deformity . 
What is syncope? . Cerebral blood flow depends on maintenance of blood pressure, which in turn is directly related to both cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance such that a drop in either may be associated with a fall or presyncope . Features that may help to clarify if blackout has a cardiac cause are detailed in Table 3.1 . There may be a short prodromal phase of sweating, dizziness or a sensation of fainting, often lasting less than 30 seconds . Although many patients are briefly disorientated on regaining consciousness, recovery is rapid and complete within a short period (usually minutes) . It is unusual to have a prolonged period of unconsciousness (more than 5 minutes) with a cardiac cause, although witness description is notoriously unreliable . Patients are usually lucid quickly after an episode . Tonic-clonic seizure, although uncommon, can occur because of cerebral anoxia and does not exclude a cardiac cause . Urinary incontinence is rare . The desire to sleep afterwards is also uncommon . Syncope is much more common than epilepsy . Self-injury is variable . In some cases, symptoms may occur over many years before a diagnosis is made . In many cases, specific precipitating factors are uncommon . Presyncope needs to be differentiated from dizziness, which can include vertigo . Syncope may be due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or intermittent advanced heart block . These patients require urgent cardiological investigation . The differential diagnoses for the causes of falls and blackouts are shown in Table 3.3 . However, instances of sudden unheralded blackout without prodromal symptoms and with brief loss of consciousness are almost certainly cardiac in origin . Further investigations will help to ascertain whether the blackout has a cardiac cause . Clinical history . The clinical history remains of critical importance . The following aspects should be reviewed and obtained prior to initiating a work-up . the time of day of the syncope . whether syncope occurred following micturition . whether the fainting episode occurred suddenly or gradually . Non-invasive testing . On physical examination, the heart sounds and presence of murmurs could alert the physician to valvular abnormalities such as aortic stenosis or hypertrophic myopathy, or physical signs of congestive heart failure could suggest LV dysfunction . A 2D echocardiogram and, in specific circumstances, a treadmill exercise test should be performed . Myocardial ischemia may be ruled out by the latter or by nuclear imaging . The positive yield of monitoring will depend upon the frequency of syncopal episodes . If symptoms are infrequent, Holter monitoring for 24-48 hours will provide a very low yield and it is sometimes more cost-effective to consider an implantable loop recorder first . Newer smartphone and smartwatch applications will ultimately provide new means for patients to record their heart rhythm at nearly all times . Neurological work-up and evaluation may also be required in selected cases . Metabolic causes, such as hypoglycemia, hypoxia or even Addison's disease, may require specific laboratory work-up . Syncope associated with advanced heart block requires permanent pacing, and remains a worldwide daily presentation in the physician's office or in the emergency room . Episodes do not always occur in predictable circumstances, and, in the elderly in particular, concerns about injury are serious . Maintaining proper hydration and, in some cases, the use of elastic stockings to favor blood return to the heart is important . Salt loading orally and, sometimes, specific muscle exercises to increase core muscle tone are beneficial . Beta-blockers have been tried in the past, but recent trials have not shown a convincing benefit as far as suppression of syncope is concerned . Who should be referred? . Table 3.4 details which patients should be referred and how urgently . What should the consulting physician do? . Take a detailed history of the circumstances of the episode from the patient and, if possible, from a witness . Determine whether there were prodromal symptoms such as nausea, sweating or lightheadedness suggestive of vagally mediated syncope . Determine whether there are any associated cardiac abnormalities . Take the blood pressure with the patient lying and standing (after 2 minutes of upright posture), if indicated . Perform a 12-lead resting electrocardiogram . 
For our ancestors, physical activity was a vital element of life, for hunting and to avoid being hunted . An estimated 75% of adults get less physical activity than they should . One study showed that 56% of men and 52% of women believed they were sufficiently active to benefit health, whereas only 36% and 24%, respectively, achieved even moderate activity . Even when metabolically normal, obese subjects tend to be at increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases . Physical activity must be reintroduced to our lives - by scheduled exercise for those who enjoy and can maintain it, or by increasing the amount and quality of activity during the daily routine, or ideally both . Risks of inactivity . Inactivity, for example prolonged sitting, carries a risk irrespective of bodyweight . Benefits of physical activity . Physical activity is an integral and essential part of any long-term weight management program . improves fitness decreases cardiometabolic risk . helps sustain weight loss maintains weight after initial 5-10% loss . A study carried out among Boston policemen showed minimal difference in weight loss with diet alone compared with diet plus exercise, but the group that exercised sustained weight loss in the long term . It is difficult to lose weight by physical activity alone but exercise reduces the adverse effects of overweight and obesity even if weight is not lost (Table 6.1) . Increasing physical activity is as beneficial to general health as giving up smoking . Maximum benefits come from a combination of resistance and aerobic activity . An increase in muscle bulk at the expense of fat has multiple benefits: apart from reduction in cardiovascular disease and diabetes, it reduces the risk of cancer and loss of cognitive function, improves mood and sense of well-being, facilitates better sleep, and reduces the risk of frailty, falls and dependence in older age . The waist circumference of someone who becomes fitter by increasing levels of activity will decrease, although their weight may change little . Encouraging patients who exercise . Individuals who attempt weight loss by physical activity alone should be congratulated on increased fitness, and should be encouraged to monitor their waist circumference; otherwise they may become frustrated and demoralized by lack of change in weight or body mass index (BMI) . Recommended levels . At least 10000 steps per day (as monitored on a pedometer) are recommended for health, and 15000 to lose weight or maintain weight loss . Extra activity can be undertaken at home, in the gym, park, sports field or shopping center, as long as it is additional activity, preferably enjoyable, and likely to be maintained in the long term to avoid rebound weight gain . Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, people who wish to improve their personal fitness further, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by doing more than the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity . Reducing sedentary behavior and increasing incidental activity . Individuals with sedentary occupations should ensure that periods of sitting are broken at least every 30 minutes by at least standing for an equivalent or even greater period of time and where possible some form of activity for a brief period . Desks that allow people to stand and work, or even walk and work are available and such behaviors confer health benefits . Strategies to increase incidental activity are shown in Table 6.2 . Individual tailoring . It is important to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual, setting realistic goals . Any increase in activity level, however small, is important, and induces an almost immediate improvement in insulin sensitivity . Long-term medical conditions may affect a person's ability to achieve meaningful levels of activity, and appropriate advice must take this into account . The US Surgeon General's report recommends wheeling oneself in a wheelchair for 40 minutes as being a reasonable level of activity for health benefits, whereas a patient with lower-limb orthopedic problems may be advised to perform low-impact activities, or even arm exercises alone . Elderly patients often suffer from low muscle mass (sarcopenia), so increased physical activity of any degree and particularly with a resistance component should be vigorously promoted for anyone with severe physical limitations . Gortmaker calculated that the risk of overweight is increased 4.6 times in children who watch more than 5 hours of television per day . The UK National Audit Office has produced some recommendations to prevent childhood obesity . at least 2 hours' physical activity a week for all pupils . broadening the range of activities schools offer to encourage young people to participate in different forms of physical recreation . 
There are several considerations when prescribing a biosimilar . Indications for which the biosimilar is approved (see the discussion of extrapolation on page 33) . Differences in the available administration devices and relevant patient support . Available doses and presentation packs . Switching a patient's medication . (This contrasts with substitution, which occurs at pharmacy level; see page 65 . Switching between different originator brands has already been a feature of medical practice in the case of epoetins and recombinant growth hormone . The demonstration of comparability with the originator biological provides clinicians with the confidence to switch a patient to a biosimilar . Experience with switching from originator to biosimilar is increasing, although published data (especially long-term outcomes) have, until recently, been limited . The term 'interchangeable' has different meanings in Europe and the USA in the context of biosimilars, with the potential to cause confusion . However, it is not a legal term . While the EMA is the central medicines regulator in the EU, regulators in individual countries have the legal right to determine how that drug can be used . For this reason, the EMA cannot determine how changing between reference medicine and biosimilars is achieved . Automatic substitution of biologics with biosimilars by pharmacists (see page 65) has been blocked in many markets, even though many have endorsed European biosimilars as 'interchangeable' . Biosimilars have been approved in the USA since 2015, but interchangeable biosimilars are unlikely to be approved here before 2019 . Concerns about immunogenicity . Product drift over time means that no biologic drug can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . However, the counter-argument is that this will happen anyway: if the patient remains on the same brand, variation will occur . Furthermore, since the biosimilar has been developed to maintain critical analytic attributes within the release specification, the risks posed by new versions of either brand must be considered similar . This concept lies behind the statement on biosimilar interchangeability by leaders of the Finnish Medicines Agency, Netherlands' Medicines Evaluation Board, the Norwegian Medicines Agency, Germany's Paul-Ehrlich-Institute and others, which concluded that biosimilars licensed in the EU are interchangeable . Naming biosimilar medicines on prescriptions . This is because, as the EMA says, a biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the same active substance . Promoting INN use has been a priority for the World Health Assembly (Resolution WHA46.19 on non-proprietary names for pharmaceutical substances) . However since biosimilars are not yet approved as suitable for automatic substitution at a pharmacy level, using the INN alone for prescribing will be insufficient . Confusingly, Europe and the USA have adopted different naming conventions - illustrated in Table 6.1 . Clear product naming in prescriptions ensures correct dispensing and also enables retrospective identification for pharmacovigilance (see page 38) . In some countries, the prescriber may have to specify that the drug may not be substituted at pharmacy level . Rules on counterfeit drugs also require the batch number to be recorded . Confusingly, epoetin-zeta (Retacrit ®) is a biosimilar of epoetin-alfa (Eprex) . Dosing when switching to a biosimilar medicine . However, the method of administration may be different in the case of an injectable; for example, the specific injection pen or device used for growth hormone preparations . Thus, if patients are switched to a new injection device, the potential for patient error or poor adherence should be managed . Generic drugs are usually considered so similar that most nations with well-resourced and technically competent regulators permit substitution by pharmacists, without the intervention of the prescribing clinician . In the USA this is signaled by inclusion in the 'Orange Book' published by the FDA . However, NHS England states that it is inappropriate to automatically substitute biologics at pharmacy level (id est to dispense a product other than the one prescribed) . Within the EU, legal restrictions have been developed to prevent automatic substitution . Patient information . It is good practice to keep patients informed of treatment changes . Authoritative information about biosimilars for patients is available from the European Commission in seven languages, which can may be adapted if national equivalents are not yet available . 
Pathogenesis and natural history of infected pancreatic necrosis . Viable bacteria may colonize pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrotic tissue, leading to infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) . Table 7.1 compares the outcomes of sterile versus infected necrosis based on the findings of a nationwide prospective study . Symptomatic collections: clinical manifestations and diagnosis . Symptomatic collections can be divided into symptomatic sterile collections and infected collections . As acute peripancreatic fluid collections are usually sterile (they very rarely become infected), the term IPN is used here to refer to infected collections . Symptoms due to collections usually begin in the late phase of AP (beyond the first week after disease onset) . Infected pancreatic necrosis is rare in the first week after disease onset . According to a cohort study, the median time to diagnosis of IPN was 26 days after disease onset . IPN should be suspected in cases of necrotic collections associated with new-onset SIRS or OF after the first week from disease onset, or if pre-existing SIRS or OF fail to improve after the first week . In this clinical scenario, if other possible sources of infection are ruled out, IPN is present in approximately 80% of patients . Gas in peripancreatic collections on imaging (Figure 7.4) strongly suggests IPN, and has been described in 42% of patients undergoing intervention for suspected infection . A definitive diagnosis of IPN requires a positive Gram stain or culture of the necrotic tissue obtained through fine-needle aspiration (FNA), minimally invasive drainage or surgery . Drainage of symptomatic collections . The management of symptomatic collections is summarized in Figure 7.5 . Indications for drainage . Generally speaking, sterile symptomatic collections can be managed conservatively . Only 1 in 10 patients or fewer with sterile necrotic collections require drainage due to symptoms, compared with almost all patients with IPN (see Table 7.1) . The method for draining the collection, once the decision is taken, is similar to that for IPN (see Figure 7.5) . Now, minimally invasive methods for drainage are available, so obtaining a definitive diagnosis is less important . The ESGE guidelines recommend against routine percutaneous FNA in patients with suspected IPN, stating that its use should be restricted to cases with a suspicion of infection but with unclear clinical/imaging signs . In most cases direct drainage for diagnosis and treatment is encouraged when IPN is suspected and other sources of infection (central-line infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, Clostridium difficile infection, etc . Timing of drainage . Invasive treatment during the first 4 weeks of disease should be avoided if possible . Percutaneous drainage would be the treatment of choice during the first 4 weeks after disease onset, but should be used only in unstable patients (exempli gratia those with uncontrolled sepsis) . All other patients should wait until the collection is mature before drainage is attempted . Drainage techniques . The advantages and drawbacks of the different drainage techniques are summarized in Table 7.2 . Open necrosectomy . Two large-bore surgical drains are placed in the collection via the incision and the skin is closed between the drains . Evidence-based selection of drainage technique . Before 2010, the standard treatment of necrotic collections (all IPNs and those symptomatic collections refractory to conservative treatment) was open necrosectomy . In 2010, the group published a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a step-up approach versus open necrosectomy for patients with IPN . The step-up approach comprised a first step of percutaneous or endoscopic transgastric drainage . In the trial, 88 patients with IPN were randomized to either the step-up approach or to open necrosectomy . The step-up approach was associated with lower rates of . In addition, 40% of patients who received the step-up approach avoided surgery altogether . In 2012, the Dutch group published a similar RCT comparing endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy versus open necrosectomy in just 22 patients . Currently, therefore, the endoscopic step-up approach seems to be the first-choice method for drainage . Choice of stent for endoscopic drainage . 
These 'non-self' components are molecular fragments called antigens . Molecular basis of cancer . Any cancer can be considered as a process characterized by unregulated cell division, cell growth and impaired cellular maturation . This does not mean it is hereditary, but rather is due to the accumulation of a number of acquired genetic changes that cause the transformation of a normal cell into a malignant cell . The genetic changes result in either over- or underexpression of the genes involved . The unmutated form of an oncogene found in normal cells is called a proto-oncogene . Tumor suppressor genes . This silencing of a suppressor gene results in upregulation of cell signaling and subsequent uncontrolled activation of the cell cycle . This would promote cancer formation in the affected cell . There are two types of lymphocyte . The B lymphocyte (or B cell), which has surface immunoglobulin as an antigen receptor consisting of two light chains and two heavy chains (Figure 2.1) . The T lymphocyte (or T cell), which has the T-cell receptor (TCR) as its antigen receptor . Genetic changes within the lymphocyte lead to an accumulation of cells, every one of which has arisen from a single cell (a clonal population) . Lymphocyte life cycle . Both B and T lymphocytes arise from a common lymphoid progenitor cell in the bone marrow . B-cell development occurs in two stages . antigen independent . antigen dependent . The earliest recognizable cell in the B-cell lineage is called the pro-B cell . This matures to produce the pre-B cell, which expresses immunoglobulin internally within the cytoplasm (along with a receptor on the surface called the pre-B-cell receptor) . This in turn develops into the immature B cell, which expresses intact immunoglobulin (IgM or IgD) on the surface of the cell . B cells then travel via the bloodstream to the spleen where they undergo further development (in the form of transitional B cells) to result in mature (though still antigen naive) B cells . There are two forms of mature B cell: the follicular B cell and the marginal zone B cell . Marginal zone B cells mostly exist at the spleen and mucosal sites . Follicular B cells may stay in the spleen or be transported to other secondary lymphoid organs, such as a lymph node, where they undergo antigen-dependent development . Within the germinal center, specialized follicular dendritic cells present the foreign antigen of the invading microorganism to B cells (Figure 2.3); if the B cells recognize the foreign antigen they are rescued from cell death by the intervention of T cells, allowing a population of B cells to survive that are capable of recognizing foreign organisms and producing antibodies that attack them . Two molecular events take place during this phase . Mutations that result in a lower affinity immunoglobulin molecule lead to cell death by apoptosis . Most B cells that enter the germinal center die by apoptosis . However, those cells that have a high-affinity immunoglobulin for the encountered antigen become either a memory B cell (which enables the body to recognize the same microorganism more quickly on subsequent exposures) or an antibody-producing plasma cell (see Figure 2.3) . T-cell maturation occurs in the other primary lymphoid organ, the thymus . The formation of a TCR is analogous to that of an immunoglobulin molecule in a B cell . Mature T cells can be broadly classified into two types . cytotoxic T cells, which, as their name suggests, can kill cells infected with microorganisms . The two cell types can be recognized by the presence of a specific molecule on their cell surface: helper T cells express CD4 whereas cytotoxic T cells express CD8 . Normal lymph-node architecture . Primary follicles are composed of resting B cells . This is the structure in which antigen is presented to B cells by follicular dendritic cells; the B cells then either proliferate or die by apoptosis, depending on the affinity of their immunoglobulin receptor for the antigen (see page 19) . Secondary follicles also have a mantle zone composed of resting B cells that have not yet encountered antigen . Alongside the cortex lies the paracortex, which is predominantly composed of T cells . 
Principles of immunotherapy . The principles of effective immunotherapy for solid tumors have been extensively reviewed . Tumor cells express antigens that provide variable levels of distinction from normal tissues . These antigens are taken up and processed by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells . Processed antigen is then presented to cells of the immune system, including T and B cells . The immune system recognizes and responds to these antigens, particularly through the development of cytotoxic T cell antigen-specific responses and development of immunologic memory . Cytotoxic effector T cells migrate to the site of the cancer and attack cells expressing the antigen . These processes evolved to facilitate recognition of intracellular pathogens such as viruses, and the immune system uses the same processes to recognize and eliminate tumor cells . Many tumor cells are eliminated before clinical evidence of cancer emerges, and some tumors live in equilibrium with the immune system until another event disturbs this equilibrium in one direction or the other . However, tumor cells adapt and evolve through natural selection to evade the immune system . Our growing understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying immune processes has led to new approaches to manipulation of the responses . Drugs targeting many of these molecules and processes are in development, as monotherapies and in combination with other immunomodulators or chemotherapeutic agents . The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis has also been a key target, described in more detail below . It is important to remember that immunotherapy does not directly target the biology of the cancer; the intention is to activate or 'de-repress' the normal immune system . Indeed, the clinical development of these agents has been rapid, with evidence of activity across many tumor types . However, not every tumor type responds, and not every patient with a potentially responsive cancer will benefit . PD-1 axis . Clinical development in bladder cancer is currently focusing on agents that interfere with the PD-1 axis, particularly the PD-1 receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) . PD-1 is a cell surface 'checkpoint' that has an important role in regulating the recruitment and activation of T cells . Overexpression of this receptor by tumor cells has been reported in several solid tumors, including bladder cancer . Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 receptor affects the immune response to cancer cells in two ways . In the lymph nodes, overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor-infiltrating immune cells can prevent the priming and activation of new cytotoxic T cells, and subsequently prevent recruitment of these immune cells to the tumor . Within the tumor microenvironment, up-regulation of PD-L1 on dendritic cells leads to deactivation of cytotoxic T cells . Expression of PD-1 is low in non-cancerous tissue so the effects of PD-1 are largely confined to the tumor site . Furthermore, therapies that act on PD-1 have the potential to reset tumor-related alterations in the immune system while leaving normal peripheral tolerance to self-antigens unaffected . PD-1-targeted immunotherapies . Occasionally patients demonstrate remarkable responses, which can be prolonged . Responses cannot be reliably predicted using existing tissue-based assays of PD-L1 or other available markers . Prediction of response . The identification of biomarkers, and therefore tests, that predict response to treatment has not been a priority in pharmaceutical drug development . The FDA simultaneously approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells to help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with atezolizumab . In contrast, the FDA recently approved pembrolizumab as a 'tissue-agnostic', for cancers with microsatellite instability or DNA mismatch repair defects . Variation in PD-L1 expression . Importantly, PD-L1 expression is both dynamic and sporadic: it probably changes over short periods, and PD-L1 is not necessarily expressed by all cells . Tissue PD-L1 expression has reasonable positive predictive value, in that cancers that are positive for PD-L1 expression are generally more likely to respond to PD-1-targeted therapies . However, cancers that do not appear to express PD-L1 may still respond to therapies targeted at the PD-1 axis . Adverse effects of immunotherapy . 
A suggested grading system is shown in Table 4.1 . Primary care . Ice-cold compresses for 20 minutes per hour if needed . Prolonged bed rest should be avoided, as it has been shown to worsen outcome . Bed rest deconditions spinal musculature in a rapid fashion . Secondary care . Tertiary care . Quaternary care . liver disease and paracetamol . gastrointestinal disorders, hypertension and renal disease and NSAIDs . coagulation defects and ASA . geriatric vulnerability . Anti-inflammatory agents . The most common gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs are . esophageal and gastrointestinal irritability . peptic ulceration and perforation . Other important side effects of all NSAIDs include . fluid retention and edema . congestive heart failure and other cardiovascular events . exacerbation of renal and hepatic disorders . Therefore, the lower dose regimen is better tolerated . Their action is in the central nervous system . Psychiatric drugs . Rehabilitation therapies . At various stages during rehabilitation, functional outcome can be assessed using one of five tests . the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) . the visual analog scale (VAS) (see Figure 1.1) . the Waddell Disability Index .

Researchers are also examining the potential of immunosuppressive gene therapy and tumor-treating fields . IDH inhibitors . It is also being evaluated for the treatment of several IDH1 -mutant solid tumors, including glioma . While the 6- and 12-month PFS rates with ivosidenib were 32.0% and 21.9%, respectively, none of the patients who received placebo were progression free for 6 months or more at data cut-off . The selective BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib has been investigated in a multicohort study that included 24 patients with glioma, including six with glioblastoma . All had received temozolomide and two had received bevacizumab . In patients with malignant diffuse glioma, the best response was a partial response; five patients had stable disease, which persisted for more than 1 year in two patients . Immune checkpoint inhibitors . Immune checkpoint inhibitors bind to and inhibit these molecules so that T cells can once again identify and attack cancer cells . Promising data reported with immune checkpoint inhibitors in other cancers have prompted their evaluation in glioblastoma . Patients received a presurgical dose of nivolumab, followed by postsurgical nivolumab . No obvious clinical benefit was substantiated following salvage surgery, but two of the three patients treated with nivolumab before and after primary surgery remained alive 28 and 33 months later (median overall survival [OS] is approximately 15 months) . However, a recent Phase III study (CheckMate-498) of nivolumab with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with MGMT -unmethylated glioblastoma failed to meet its primary endpoint of improving OS . Proteosome inhibitors . Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to exert anti-tumor activity, including reducing glioblastoma cell viability . The main eligibility criteria include histologically confirmed newly diagnosed glioblastoma and a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or more . The study aims to enrol 750 patients . Stratification factors will include institution, age, Karnofsky performance status and extent of surgery . The primary objective is to compare OS in patients receiving marizomib in addition to standard of care (temozolomide/radiotherapy, followed by temozolomide) with patients receiving standard treatment only . The study is accompanied by a translational research program . Patient enrolment started in June 2018 (clinical trial information: NCT03345095) . The vaccine contains the patient's own dendritic cells, pulsed with the patient's tumor lysate or peptides (obtained during surgical resection) . Once the vaccine has been administered back to the patient, intradermally or subcutaneously, it activates T cells to cross the blood-brain barrier and target glioblastoma cells . Vaccination-related side effects include redness and itching at the site of injection . An autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine is being trialed across 80 centers in four countries in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma . All enrolled patients underwent surgery and standard of care chemoradiotherapy (see page 47) before receiving the vaccine (n > 232) or placebo (n > 99) . The optimal timing of vaccination has yet to be determined, but it is thought that vaccination at the same time as treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy may increase the chemosensitivity of the tumor . Tumor-treating fields . Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) is an antimitotic therapy that interferes with glioblastoma cell division and organelle assembly . The study included 695 patients with glioblastoma that had been resected or biopsied and who had completed radiochemotherapy . Gene therapy . Patients are then treated with the oral compound veledimex, 20 mg, in capsule form, which activates IL-12 production . The preliminary results of a multicenter Phase I dose-escalation trial have shown a median OS of 12.7 months . In patients who also received low-dose steroids (>= 20 mg dexamethasone), the median OS was 17.8 months versus 6.4 months in patients who received high-dose steroids (< 20 mg dexamethasone) . 
This can be achieved by inhibiting the activity of plasmin by aprotinin, or tPA by tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) . Tranexamic acid and EACA are synthetic lysine-containing amino acids . They have recently been found to reduce bleeding following trauma or surgery in a wide range of clinical settings . Tranexamic acid and . Also, dose adjustment is required in patients with moderate or severe renal failure . In the absence of a structural lesion in the uterus, tranexamic acid may reduce menstrual loss because fibrinolytic activity is high in the endometrium . If these fail, or are contraindicated, oral tranexamic acid, 1 g three times daily, can reduce bleeding by 30-50% if taken during the first few days of menstruation . The stomach lining has a high concentration of fibrinolytic enzymes and there is some evidence that tranexamic acid reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeding . It is useful as an adjunct to another more specific therapy (exempli gratia endoscopic injection of epinephrine [adrenaline] into the base of a bleeding peptic ulcer) . Bleeding in the urinary tract . This fibrinolytic activity in urine, however, tends to exacerbate any tendency to bleed, such as after prostatectomy or if a bladder polyp is present . In these circumstances, tranexamic acid inhibits urokinase and can reduce bleeding from the bladder . It should not be given systemically if there is a possibility of bleeding into the ureter or kidney, because clots forming in the ureter may not be lysed and cause obstructive uropathy and renal failure . To avoid this complication, the bladder can be irrigated and then tranexamic acid or EACA instilled to provide local inhibition of fibrinolysis . Trauma-induced bleeding . The Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH)-2 study demonstrated that if tranexamic acid was given to bleeding trauma victims blood loss was reduced and there was a 1.5% reduction in mortality . As a result of this very large study, tranexamic acid should be considered for all major trauma patients . Fibrinolytic inhibitors reduce bleeding and the consequent need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing complicated cardiac surgery . There is evidence of benefit in a wide range of other elective surgical procedures traditionally associated with bleeding, including spinal fusion and total knee replacement surgery . Tranexamic acid or EACA may also be used to help prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia who require minor surgery . Bleeding disorders . In most patients with congenital (exempli gratia hemophilia) or acquired bleeding disorders, the appropriate way to manage bleeding or potential bleeding (exempli gratia after surgery) is to raise the plasma level of the deficient clotting factor . Tranexamic acid has a well-defined role in patients with bleeding disorders after dental extraction; it should be given orally in a dose of 15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 10 days and can also be used as a mouthwash (50 mg/mL) in the immediate postoperative period . Previously it had a place in cardiac surgery, where it was of proven benefit in reducing blood loss . However, recent studies have demonstrated that a proportion of patients develop severe renal failure following its use . For example, to cover dental surgery or other minor surgery the level of the deficient factor need only be raised to about 50% normal for 4-6 hours . FVIII and VWF levels peak after 30-60 minutes . It is important to note that desmopressin also releases tPA; therefore, the concomitant administration of tranexamic acid or EACA is often considered . Desmopressin also has a place in the treatment of other congenital bleeding disorders (exempli gratia platelet storage pool disorder) and some acquired conditions (exempli gratia renal failure; see Chapter 9) . Desmopressin should be used with caution . Desmopressin should not be given to patients with clinical evidence of atherosclerosis because of the risk of thrombosis when raising the VWF/FVIII levels . Their effectiveness is variable, depending on the extent and location of the wound and the intensity of bleeding .

Hypertension is the most common chronic disease in the Western world; by the age of 60 years, over 50% of the population will have developed high blood pressure (see . Fast Facts: Hypertension) . Hypertension is even more common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); by the time patients develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), over 80% have elevated blood pressure, and hypertension accounts for approximately 20% of all cases of kidney failure . After the age of 60 years, most of the population either has hypertension or is at risk of developing it . Hypertension associated with parenchymal kidney disease represents a potent vicious cycle; it is both a consequence of CKD and a cause of progressive kidney damage . Since hypertension is a common chronic condition, the evaluation and treatment of comorbidities associated with hypertension should be an integral part of management . In most patients, urine protein measurement is a useful indicator of kidney involvement . Antihypertensive therapy is beneficial in reducing both cardiovascular and renal events, as well as lowering mortality . In patients with CKD, treating hypertension is important in slowing disease progression and in reducing cardiovascular risk . In patients with ESKD, the focus should be directed towards reducing cardiovascular morbidity . Patients with albuminuric CKD (> 500 mg albumin/24 hours) require aggressive management of blood pressure, with a target of less than 130/80 mmHg . In young women with hypertension of recent onset, fibromuscular renal artery disease should be excluded . Patients unlikely to have a positive response (and perhaps all patients) should receive aggressive medical therapy to control blood pressure, together with statins and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) . Hypertensive emergencies are situations in which an immediate reduction in blood pressure is required in order to prevent or treat acute, progressive, target-organ damage . Chronic hypertension is more common in multiparous women, and is present at the first antenatal visit . ACE inhibitors are contraindicated from the second trimester, but may be important in controlling the progression of CKD . Diabetic nephropathy . Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESKD in Europe and the USA . Its prevalence is increasing as patients with diabetes are living longer and the complications of diabetes are better controlled . Diabetic nephropathy is defined by the presence of albuminuria . Most patients will also develop hypertension, which initially manifests as the absence of a nocturnal dip in blood pressure, but later becomes sustained hypertension . The mortality of patients with diabetic nephropathy is higher than in other patients because of a four- to eightfold increase in the rate of cardiovascular complications . Diabetic nephropathy in pregnancy can lead to worse hypertension, an increased risk of pre-eclampsia and an accelerated decline in kidney function . Type 2 diabetes . All patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened for incipient or established diabetic nephropathy, because microalbuminuria is present at diagnosis in approximately 25% of patients . Type 1 diabetes . The major factor influencing the development of diabetic nephropathy is hyperglycemia . Apart from glycemic control, the other major factor determining progression through diabetic nephropathy is hypertension . Aggressive intervention in patients with either incipient or established nephropathy has been shown unequivocally to prevent progression of renal disease . Overwhelming evidence implicates hypertension as a major risk factor in the progression of diabetic nephropathy . Hypertension usually appears during the microalbuminuric phase of disease, although in type 2 diabetes it may result from other causes, such as renovascular disease . Both systolic and diastolic hypertension accelerate the progression of diabetic nephropathy . Aggressive management of hypertension reduces the progression of diabetic renal disease . Angiotensin blockade should be the first-line therapy, but most patients will require multiple drugs . Many studies have shown that in diabetic (and non-diabetic) patients with kidney disease, angiotensin blockade can reduce the level of albuminuria and the rate of progression of renal disease to a greater degree than other antihypertensive agents . As a high proportion of patients progress from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy and subsequently to ESKD, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended for all patients with microalbuminuria . 
The signs and symptoms of pancreaticobiliary diseases are usually non-specific . It may be gradual and associated with anorexia and weight loss . The physical examination is complex and dependent on the suspected diagnosis . Patients with acute pancreatic or biliary pain (see above) tend to be anxious and cannot find a good comfortable position . An abdominal exam is important as it may reveal palpable masses in the right upper quadrant, or an enlarged gallbladder, due to obstruction by stones or a tumor . Multiple tests with variable sensitivity and specificity are used for the differential diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary diseases . These can highlight a possible cause for suspected biliary or pancreatic diseases . As the signs and symptoms of pancreaticobiliary diseases are non-specific, imaging is key to the diagnosis and management of patients . Imaging can clarify the presence and site of obstruction, as well as a possible cause in patients with cholestasis . Transabdominal ultrasound provides morphological information of the gallbladder, as well as the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tracts and pancreas . The accuracy for gallbladder diseases (especially for gallstones) reaches close to 100% but the technique is examiner dependent . Transabdominal ultrasound is used in patients with obstructive jaundice to show the level of obstruction (dilated intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts) and the possible cause; nonetheless, the specificity is quite low for the differential diagnosis of stones in the common bile duct (CBD) compared with cholangiocarcinomas or pancreatic tumors larger than 2 cm . Computed tomography and CT cholangiography can be used in patients with intra- or extrahepatic obstruction, although their accuracy in determining the cause of obstruction seems to be lower than for other imaging tests . Multidetector helical CT and MRI are the methods of choice for the initial cross-sectional examination of the pancreas, including the evaluation of acute and chronic pancreatitis and early detection and staging of pancreatic tumors . MRI is an exciting but expensive method that is useful for identification of pancreaticobiliary tumors . For some indications, such as evaluation of pancreatic cystic tumors, some clinicians prefer MRI because of its improved accuracy and detection of pancreatic cysts . MRI has the added advantage over CT of not exposing patients to ionizing radiation; however, due to claustrophobia, MRI is not possible in a number of patients and EUS has to be used instead . MRI can be supported with MRCP sequences that allow for high-accuracy examination of the bile ducts and pancreatic duct for diagnosis of stones and tumor masses . MRCP has replaced endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a diagnostic method and is also used as a screening method for the selection of patients that require therapeutic ERCP . EUS can detect CBD or gallbladder stones (microlithiasis) and therefore offers useful information in patients with suspected acute biliary pancreatitis or acute idiopathic pancreatitis . Detection of CBD stones using EUS is high (95%) compared with MRCP, thus avoiding invasive procedures and aiding the selection of patients for therapeutic ERCP . EUS has at least a similar accuracy with MRCP in the detection of CBD tumors and allows EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), which is followed by cytological or microhistological examination of the sampled material . Furthermore, EUS enables early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and the assessment of patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis by combining the evaluation of parenchymal and ductal criteria such as stones, duct dilation and/or the presence of pseudocysts . EUS has a higher sensitivity than other imaging modalities and facilitates the diagnosis of small pancreatic masses less than 2 cm . In addition, tissue diagnosis by EUS-FNA gives this type of imaging a distinct advantage over other cross-sectional methods . In experienced hands EUS is also used for therapeutic indications in pancreaticobiliary diseases . This makes both diagnosis and therapy of pancreaticobiliary diseases possible in one procedure . The method is used in selected patients with either retained stones or unclear stenoses suspected of malignancy . Bile leaking and bleeding are complications seen in up to 10% of patients . The method is now entirely used for therapeutic purposes since other less invasive and risky imaging modalities can be used for diagnostic purposes . 
Knowledge of how schizophrenia is distributed within and between cultures provides an important clue for theories of causation and useful input for planning mental health services . Since the late 1990s, how we think about the geographic distribution of schizophrenia has changed . How common, how global? . The incidence of schizophrenia is the number of new cases, expressed either annually or as lifetime risk . The prevalence of schizophrenia is the total number of cases, either at a particular point in time (point prevalence) or over a particular period (exempli gratia lifetime prevalence) . Incidence studies of epidemiological samples show that there are approximately two new cases of ICD schizophrenia, or approximately one new case of DSM schizophrenia, per 10000 population each year . Schizophrenia exists in all cultures in all countries . Until relatively recently, it was believed that incidence rates were similar around the globe, based on results from large-scale studies carried out by the World Health Organization . A fivefold difference in incidence rates around the globe is now known to exist, with higher rates in developed countries than in developing countries . The incidence of schizophrenia is slightly more common in men, with a male:female ratio of 1.4:1 . Men are also more likely than women to develop enduring negative symptoms . Season of birth has been found to correlate with the development of schizophrenia: a well-replicated finding is that people who develop schizophrenia are about 8% more likely than the general population to have been born in late winter or early spring (January to March in the northern hemisphere; July to September in the southern hemisphere) . It is unlikely to be due to seasonal fluctuations in intrauterine infections (most frequent in winter and spring), since these have their main impact in the first trimester and would therefore be more likely to correlate with a raised incidence of schizophrenia among summer births . An alternative explanation is an alteration in the normal seasonal pattern of conceptions (slightly higher in summer) in parents carrying a schizophrenia gene . It has been recognized since the 1990s that rates of psychosis are higher in ethnic minority groups . In the UK and Europe, rates of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are higher in several ethnic groups, particularly black people from Africa and the Caribbean . The size of the effect has been shown to depend on the cultural milieu, with the highest rates observed in African Caribbean people living in mainly white areas . Overall, global studies have shown that rates of schizophrenia in all migrant groups are twice those found in native populations . City life and schizophrenia . It has long been known that rates of schizophrenia are higher in urban than in rural areas . Early surveys seemed to show that this was due to the drift of people into urban areas after the illness started, rather than to higher rates of new cases in cities . However, large studies have confirmed that new cases arise more commonly in cities, with the rates being proportional to the degree of urbanization . This appears to be an unexpectedly large effect . The relative risk for large-city dwellers compared with that for rural residents is only two- to threefold (see Table 5.2, page 44) but, because much of the population lives in cities, the proportion of schizophrenia that can be explained by this factor is about one-third . Being brought up in a city appears to be the critical factor, and the risk increases the more childhood years spent in an urban environment . The factors associated with city life that lead to this higher incidence remain to be clarified . The data suggest that those with a genetic vulnerability are most at risk of the effects of urban upbringing . Course, outcome and mortality . However, such studies are rare . This effect can be partially attributed to a tenfold increase in suicide rates: young men in the first 3 years of their illness are most at risk . However, much of the increased mortality is due to the deleterious effect of poor diet, obesity, smoking and lack of exercise, all of which are more common among the population with schizophrenia . Longitudinal studies of isolated, subclinical psychotic experiences show incidence and prevalence rates of about 3% and 8%, respectively, which are 10-100 times higher than the rates for full psychotic disorders . The peak age of onset is in adolescence and the symptoms are transient in most cases . One school of thought is that these experiences represent part of the phenotype of schizophrenia or at least psychosis (Figure 3.3), and that a proportion of these individuals may progress to 'prodromal' symptoms, as described in Chapter 12 (pages 110 -), and of these a further proportion will develop schizophrenia . 
Acne (acne vulgaris) can affect all age groups, including neonates, infants, prepubescent children, adolescents and mature adults . Once regarded as a transient disease of puberty, acne now starts earlier and lasts longer (Figure 1.1) . Pre-adolescent acne . Acne before the onset of puberty is not common . However, the distinction between pre-adolescence and adolescence by age can be challenging, so the term prepubertal acne is frequently used . In addition, defining acne by age does not necessarily identify children that are at risk of treatable forms of virilization . A focused history and examination should be adopted to ensure underlying hormonal abnormalities and adrenal or gonadal tumors are identified . Neonatal acne may present at birth or shortly afterwards, up to 28 days . It is a self-limiting benign process and does not generally result in any scarring . Erythematous papules and pustules are commonly distributed on the cheeks, chin and forehead (Figure 1.2) . Occasionally, these extend to the neck, scalp and upper trunk . Neonatal acne usually settles spontaneously and leaves little in the way of scars . Neonatal cephalic pustulosis (NCP) was first described in 1991 and is thought by some to be an explanation for neonatal acne . This disorder usually presents in the first 3 weeks of life; the prevalence in newborns, as described in the literature, varies considerably from 10% to 66% . It is characterized by erythematous papular/pustular lesions, especially on the cheeks, but also on the chin, eyelids, neck and upper chest . Comedonal lesions are not usually seen . It has been postulated that NCP develops in association with Malassezia sympodialis and M . globosa; however, the exact etiologic role of Malassezia is uncertain, as the organism is part of the normal flora of neonatal skin and in one study up to 38% of cases had negative smears . Another explanation is that NCP relates to an overgrowth of lipophilic yeasts at birth that results in an inflammatory reaction leading to monomorphic papules and pustules in predisposed neonates with more sebum production . NCP does not normally require treatment as it is a self-limiting disorder that usually heals without scarring in 1-3 months . If the condition does persist beyond this time and/or is widespread and unsightly, topical ketoconazole cream helps to shorten the course of the disease . Infantile acne is seen more rarely than neonatal acne but is often misdiagnosed . Infantile acne typically presents after 6 months . Most cases resolve by the age of 5 years but occasionally some lesions remain as a continuum until puberty . A history of a sibling with infantile acne may be notable, and a family history of severe acne is not uncommon . Patients with infantile acne may develop a resurgence of their acne as teenagers, and parents should be advised accordingly . The central cheeks are frequently affected, and lesions embrace a combination of inflamed papules/pustules with open and closed comedones . The acne was predominantly inflammatory in 59% . Five patients (17%) were left with scarring . Acne developing within this age range should always raise the suspicion of androgen excess and the need for further investigation . Lesions are frequently located in a mid-facial distribution and may precede any other signs of maturation . The development of acne in childhood along with premature adrenarche may be an initial sign of polycystic ovary syndrome or metabolic syndrome . Acne occurs earlier in females than males, reaching peak severity in females at about 17 years, compared with 19 or 20 years in males . Adult female acne is seen more commonly in dermatology clinics than adult male acne . Although acne is a universal condition, studies suggest a link between geographic environment and prevalence, with an intrinsically lower prevalence in people living in rural locations than those living in urban environments . Acne in patients over 40 years of age may be a product of modern urban lifestyles . Further investigation is required to confirm this . Affected sites . The first site to be affected is usually the face, but later the trunk is significantly involved in about 30% of patients . Examples of facial acne can be found in Chapter 3 . 
The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial . The etiology of sporadic brain tumors is unknown, but environmental factors are suspected . Most patients with a family history of primary brain tumors have a hereditary disease that is known to be associated with such tumors, such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, familial polyposis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome . However, some patients do not have any underlying or obvious hereditary disorder that would predispose them to primary brain tumors, but nevertheless give a striking history of these tumors in first-degree relatives . Usually, the tumors are found to be high-grade gliomas . Although it is feasible that germline abnormalities could lead to the development of primary brain tumors in these families, there are a number of unusual demographic features suggesting an environmental rather than genetic explanation for brain tumor clustering . Most cases of confirmed familial cancers are multigenerational, and affected individuals are younger than average for the tumor . However, brain tumor families who do not have one of the recognized hereditary diseases usually involve parent-child and sibling-sibling cases; it is rare for more than two generations to be involved . These observations suggest that familial exposure to an environmental toxin or ionizing radiation may account for the clustering of primary brain tumors in these families . Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate patient surveillance for another occult brain tumor or associated disease, for screening family members, and for genetic counseling . Most patients presenting with primary brain tumors will, however, be sporadic cases and the etiology will remain unknown . Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 3500 . However, this disease can occur sporadically, with up to 50% of cases arising as spontaneous mutations . a first-degree relative with neurofibromatosis type 1 . Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 40 000 . The gene responsible for this disorder, NF2, is located on 22q12 . This gene codes for a protein known as merlin or schwannomin that is thought to have a tumor suppressive function . Approximately half of all cases of neurofibromatosis type 2 are due to spontaneous genetic mutations . two of the following . multiple meningiomas . Some patients experienced improvement in hearing as well . Further research is warranted before this treatment can be recommended for patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 . The gene responsible for this disease, VHL, is located on 3p25-26 . a first-degree relative with Von Hippel-Lindau disease . Tuberous sclerosis is a group of autosomal dominant disorders, with an incidence between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 10 000 . This class of drugs has great potential to alter the clinical manifestations and outcome of this disease . Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which there is an increased risk of multiple tumors developing in children and young adults, including breast cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas and primary brain tumors . The incidence of the disorder has not been established, but it is known to be due to a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 on 17p13 . at least one first-degree relative with any tumor before age 45, or . a second- or first-degree relative with cancer before the age of 45 or a sarcoma at any age . There are no non-neoplastic manifestations . The incidence of this syndrome is unknown . Diagnosis requires the coexistence of primary brain and colon tumors . There are two distinct syndromes . The neoplastic neurological manifestations of the syndrome are glioblastoma and medulloblastoma; there are no non-neoplastic manifestations . Tumor-like cysts . They are midline tumors that arise from fetal neural and ectodermal tissues . It is safe to follow asymptomatic patients radiographically . The lack of calcification may help to distinguish these cysts from craniopharyngiomas . Neurenteric cysts are congenital epithelial cysts that occur in the spinal canal or posterior fossa . Brain tumor syndromes and tumor-like cysts . 
Eating disorders are far more prevalent among women . The UK's Royal College of Psychiatrists states that girls and women are ten times more likely than boys and men to suffer from anorexia . In the Rochester study the overall annual age-adjusted incidence was 14.6 women per 100000 inhabitants . For men, the overall age-adjusted incidence was 1.8 per 100000 inhabitants . Age groups affected . In the same study in Rochester, 69.4 in 100000 15-19 year-old girls had anorexia, which made it the third most frequent disorder among teenage girls in the USA . The prevalence (total number of cases in a population at a specific point or over a given period) of anorexia within secondary-education establishments has been studied in the USA, Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Australia . Studies of at least 1000 girls and young women (aged 10-23 years), including face-to-face interviews, have shown the overall prevalence of anorexia to range from 0.1% to 0.9% . Among adult women, the lifetime prevalence of anorexia ranges from 0.3% according to a narrow clinical definition to 3.7% according to a broad clinical definition . In a meta-analysis, the 1-year prevalence rate of anorexia in the community was calculated as 0.37% in young females . The peak age of onset of anorexia is between 13 and 15 years of age . Thus prevalence and incidence are particularly high among 15-25-year-olds, who constitute approximately 40% of all identified cases (Figure 2.1) . Personality characteristics and eating disorder psychopathology are unique in this population and the course of the disorder in this group is particularly severe . Anorexia has long been considered as a disorder affecting mainly young women from middle to high economic classes in wealthy countries . While the disorder continues to be more prevalent in Western industrialized nations of white ethnicity and in middle- to upper-class women, there is an increasing diversity of those affected in terms of socioeconomic status and ethnicity, including African, Asian and Indian groups . In the USA, significant differences in the prevalence of anorexia were found by race in a geographically and economically diverse community sample of white and black 19-24-year-old women; none of the black women was found to have had anorexia (Figure 2.2) . Only a few incidence studies of bulimia have been conducted, with an annual incidence rate of 13.5 per 100000 person-years in Rochester, USA, and 6.6 per 100000 person-years in the UK . As with other eating disorders, bulimia has a much higher prevalence in women than in men . The reported lifetime prevalence of bulimia ranges from 1.0% to 2.8% among women, and is about 0.5% among men . The male to female prevalence ratio for bulimia is 1:5 . However, the disorder may be increasingly affecting male athletes and performers . Only a very small minority of female and male individuals with bulimia in the community enter the mental healthcare system . Age groups affected . The peak age of onset for bulimia is in late adolescence or early adulthood, between 17 and 25 years of age . The condition is less frequently found in teenagers than in adult women . Bulimia is more commonly found in Western industrialized nations, specifically in populations that are of middle- and upper-class socioeconomic status . Nevertheless, in the past decade, populations of young African, Latino and Asian women have also been adversely affected as bulimia has reached more diverse populations . In the US community sample of women aged 19-24 years of age described above, the odds of detecting bulimia in white women were six times that of black women (see Figure 2.2) . Other eating disorders . Epidemiological studies show that even in individuals who do not match the criteria for a specific eating disorder, patterns of 'disordered eating' are highly prevalent . 'Eating disorders not otherwise specified' (EDNOS; see 1 . iii) are probably more common than classic eating disorders in young people . In both adolescents and adults, atypical eating disorders (EDNOS) account for more than 50% of cases in the community and in eating disorder treatment clinics . The most recent epidemiological studies on eating disorders are population based, specifically assess juveniles and use state-of-the-art two-stage screening designs that comprise surveys followed by interviews . 
The diagnosis of RA rests on the presence of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features . The new criteria attempt to ascertain the likelihood of developing persistent damaging joint inflammation that requires therapy in patients with recent-onset synovitis . A tree algorithm can also be used to classify RA (Figure 5.1) . The most common joints to be affected by RA at presentation are the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP)joints of the hands, and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints of the feet . In addition to pain and swelling, early morning stiffness of affected joint areas is highly characteristic . This distribution of joint involvement results in early functional impairment and slowed mobility, to which excessive fatigue and malaise may contribute . Objectively, there may be swelling of affected joints, which can be accentuated by inflammation of overlying tendon sheaths, particularly in the hands . While this is the most common presentation of RA, there are many other possibilities . The disease can affect any synovial joint, and larger joints such as the elbows, shoulders or knees may also be involved . Unusual symptoms reflect the involvement of joints such as the crico-arytenoid joint of the larynx, with resultant hoarseness . In such patients, the coexistence of myalgic and arthritic symptoms further compounds disability . Established rheumatoid arthritis . The picture of established RA is changing as a result of effective therapies being used earlier in the disease . Thus, the signs may be similar to those of early disease, although more joints generally become affected as the disease becomes established . Subluxation and ulnar deviation at the MCP joints, and subluxation at the wrist are also characteristic features of established RA . In the feet, the subtalar joint and talonavicular joint are more commonly affected than the ankle joint itself . Disease of the MTP joints and associated tendons results in splaying and clawing of the toes, followed by subluxation . Neuromuscular complications . In established RA, there is significant muscle wasting around affected joints . RA can affect the cervical spine at any level, leading to various sequelae . More commonly, synovitis of the apophyseal joints at lower cervical levels leads to subluxation and spinal cord compression . Entrapment neuropathies are also common causes of pain, neurological symptoms and muscle wasting in RA . Extra-articular features . Most extra-articular features of RA occur in RF-positive individuals with severe active joint disease . In particular, corneal 'melts' frequently arise in elderly patients with minimal inflammatory joint symptoms . There is no obvious explanation for this paradox, which emphasizes the importance of regular and systematic review of RA patients by a specialist throughout the course of their disease . Systemic features . The most common extra-articular manifestation is the rheumatoid nodule . Nodules often improve with effective treatment of RA, but methotrexate may worsen nodulosis in some patients despite improvement in articular disease activity . It is important to distinguish disease-related changes in these test results from abnormalities induced by therapies . Hematological complications . Active RA is often associated with anemia . In Felty's syndrome, patients with RA develop splenomegaly with features of hypersplenism (pancytopenia in the peripheral blood) . Chest disease . Lung involvement is common in RA, with pleural disease being present in up to 50% of postmortem examinations . In a community-based study, 6% of RA patients developed symptomatic interstitial lung disease within 10 years of disease onset . Ocular complications . The most common ocular complication of RA is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eyes (xerophthalmia) . Raynaud's symptoms are common in the general population but have an increased prevalence in patients with RA and other connective tissue diseases . Leg ulcers may also be vasculitic in RA (Figure 5.7) . Osteoporosis is a common and underdiagnosed complication of RA . Clinical features . The pathological and etiologic heterogeneity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is reflected clinically, and RA can be difficult to diagnose in its earliest stages . 
In the early stages of the disease, conventional spirometry may reveal no abnormality . Diagnosing COPD using spirometry . Three indices can then be derived . forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) . the ratio of FEV to FVC, expressed as a percentage . Values within +- 20% of the predicted values are considered to be within the normal range . Thus, an FEV of over 80% of the predicted value is considered to be normal . A ratio of less than 0.7 indicates airflow obstruction (Figure 4.2) . It also has the potential to underdiagnose disease in younger individuals . Thus, normal spirometric values do not exclude the presence of disease . Classification of severity . It is important that a volume plateau is reached in spirometry . If this maneuver is not carried out properly, the FVC can be underestimated . Many spirometers currently in use substitute the forced expiratory volume in 6 seconds for FVC . In contrast to maximal efforts, which are highly reproducible, submaximal efforts are highly variable . The slow VC is often 0.5 liters greater than the FVC . In assessing FEV, the following points should be remembered . Patients should be sitting in an upright position . An adequate explanation of the technique should be given . Three technically satisfactory maneuvers giving similar results should be carried out . At least two readings of FEV should be within 100 mL or 5% of each other . Peak expiratory flow . Bronchodilator reversibility testing . to establish the best obtainable lung function . There is no agreement on a standardized method of assessing reversibility . Most guidelines recommend that changes should be considered significant only if they exceed 200 mL . The high dose can be delivered by means of a nebulizer . However, larger changes (> 400 mL) are suggestive of asthma . Specialized lung function tests . Flow-volume loops . The PEF, which is sustained for 10 ms, represents the flow only in the larger airways . Examples of flow-volume loops in airflow obstruction are shown in Figure 4.6 . The flow-volume loop can also help to identify the presence of obstruction of the large airways . The patterns of obstruction can vary with inspiration and expiration . Lung volumes . Some of the reduction in carbon monoxide level is also due to diffusion into the residual volume of the lung . The principal factors affecting the DLco are . the thickness of the alveolar membrane . capillary blood volume . Arterial blood gases and oximetry . Blood for measurement of blood gases should be obtained by arterial puncture . An SaO of 88% or below indicates the need for supplemental oxygen . Exercise tests . Exercise induces an increase in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production in skeletal muscle . Exercise-induced desaturation can be an indication for supplemental oxygen therapy . Other tests may be used in special circumstances . There is only a weak relationship between walking distance and FEV . The number of completed shuttles is recorded . Assessment of breathlessness . Although breathlessness is a subjective feature, it should be quantified . The oxygen-cost diagram is more sensitive to change than the mMRC dyspnea scale . Other scales allow quantification of breathlessness according to the intensity of the sensation . It is sensitive and reproducible . The score is the distance along the line that the patient has marked . Health status . The SGRQ has been most validated in COPD . The threshold of clinical improvement is a change of four units in the SGRQ . Exacerbations of COPD have a clear detrimental effect on health status . The CAT score varies between 0 and 40 . It worsens during exacerbations . Respiratory muscle function . Sleep studies . Individuals who desaturate during the night may, however, be candidates for oxygen therapy . Other assessments . These findings should lead to family screening and appropriate counseling and, where available, consideration for replacement therapy . Pulmonary arterial pressure . Differential diagnosis . 
At presentation, cardiac biomarkers may be normal or elevated . In this scenario, the keys to optimizing patient outcomes in ACS are . accurate initial diagnosis . appropriate risk stratification . proper therapeutic decision-making . Chest pain . Most often, pain in the chest feels like a pressure or heaviness lasting for more than 20 minutes . It may or may not be severe . Occasionally, chest pain may be perceived in the right side of the chest or intrascapular region . Useful questions to ask the patient about their chest pain include . What does it feel like? . Where is it located? . Does it stay in one spot or does it radiate to another spot? . When do you notice it? What brings it on? . Is it associated with exertion, meals or certain body positions? . How long does it last? . How severe is it? . When was the last episode? . Have you found anything that makes it feel better? . Have you found anything that makes it feel worse? . Can you reproduce it by pushing on your chest wall? . Physical examination . Auscultation of the chest may provide evidence of congestive heart failure . Without this, 8-10% of STEMIs may be misdiagnosed as NSTEMIs . Continuous monitoring provides vital information about arrhythmias or the development of recurrent ischemia . ST-segment deviation . Minor ST-segment depression (< 0.05 mV) may be difficult to interpret . Persistent ST elevation for more than 20 minutes suggests STEMI (see Figure 1.1) . The definitive roles of these novel techniques require further evaluation in large-scale trials . Deceleration capacity . T-wave alternans is measured during bicycle exercise stress testing . Markers of myocardial injury . Elevated circulating levels of these substances are a hallmark of MI . Cardiac troponins as prognostic indicators . Other cardiac biomarkers . A comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of cardiac markers is given in Table 2.4 . Other biomarkers . Markers of inflammation . However, the diagnostic value of hsCRP in ACS has not been firmly established . The timing of CRP measurement is critical, since CRP levels may change between ACS presentation and recovery . Other markers of inflammation are shown in Table 2.3 . Markers of neurohormonal activation . Moreover, the optimal time to measure BNP and the definitive cutoff value for prognosis have not yet been defined . Markers of acute endogenous stress . Definition of myocardial infarction . In addition, either one of the following criteria satisfy the diagnosis of an acute, evolving or recent MI . ischemic symptoms . development of pathological Q waves on the ECG . coronary artery intervention (exempli gratia coronary angioplasty) . Pathological findings of an acute MI . Any one of the following criteria satisfies the diagnosis of an established or previous MI . Development of new pathological Q waves on serial ECGs . The patient may or may not remember previous symptoms . Pathological findings of a healed or healing MI . Echocardiography may help to identify ischemic regions by detecting new wall motion abnormalities . Imaging techniques can determine ventricular function or the coronary anatomy responsible for ACS . Invasive coronary angiography is the primary tool to identify significant lesions that require intervention . However, CT angiography (CTA) provides excellent resolution of the coronary anatomy . Ischemic risk stratification . The TIMI score is based on seven independent, easily assessed prognostic variables .

Optimizing patient outcomes . The key initial differentiation is between STEMI and UA/NSTEMI based on the 12-lead ECG . Bleeding risk . 
Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency can be associated with a range of complications (Table 5.1) . Although complications are more frequent in patients with severe anemia and frequent transfusions, the likelihood of a given complication in an individual patient is not predictable based on hemoglobin and transfusion burden and thus all patients with PK deficiency require regular monitoring (Table 5.2) . Main complications . In patients who receive regular blood transfusions, complete blood counts should be evaluated before transfusion . In those patients who do not receive transfusions on a regular basis, complete blood counts and a reticulocyte count should be monitored at least annually and with any significant worsening of baseline symptoms . Patients who receive transfusions, regularly or irregularly, should have annual viral screening . Pregnancy can also be a common hemolytic trigger . scleral icterus and jaundice associated with significant hemolysis . Patients with PK deficiency who have an acute parvovirus infection will usually require a transfusion, even if they have never been previously transfused . Parvovirus infection will occur only once in a patient's lifetime . Nearly every patient with PK deficiency will have an elevated indirect bilirubin level (Figure 5.1) . Thus, splenectomy should not be pursued to improve jaundice in patients with PK deficiency . Gallstones are a frequent complication in patients of all ages with PK deficiency because of the increased unconjugated bilirubin related to hemolysis . Many individuals with PK deficiency develop splenomegaly . Transfusion-associated hemosiderosis is a predictable complication of chronic transfusion therapy as the body will receive iron from the transfused RBCs, but lacks a mechanism for getting rid of any excess . However, transfusion-independent iron loading also occurs in patients with PK deficiency and is under-recognized, occurring at all ages and in patients with both mild and more severe anemia . Transfusion-related iron loading . The association between transfusions and iron loading is similar in PK deficiency to that seen in other transfusion-dependent red cell disorders . Regular ferritin monitoring before transfusions and annual MRI assessment are indicated in patients who receive transfusions, and ongoing chelation therapy is necessary in those who receive regular transfusions . Non-transfusion-related iron loading . Hemosiderosis also occurs frequently in individuals with PK deficiency in the absence of transfusions . Non-transfusion-related iron loading can occur at all ages and in patients with all hemoglobin levels . Although patients with both PK deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis will have an increased risk of iron loading, ineffective erythropoiesis associated with PK deficiency is likely to be the main contributor to transfusion-independent iron loading in this hemolytic disorder . Given that iron loading occurs through the gastrointestinal route, patients with PK deficiency should avoid iron supplements, including multivitamins with iron, and excessive consumption of foods high in iron . While cardiac iron loading occurs, it is significantly less frequent than hepatic iron overload . Because iron loading is common in PK deficiency, all patients, regardless of their transfusion status, should have their iron levels monitored at least annually with ferritin measurement . Chelation therapy may also be needed intermittently in patients who do not receive transfusions as their MRI assessments are monitored . Although extramedullary hematopoiesis is not a frequent complication of PK deficiency, it is not uncommon . Patients with PK deficiency are at risk of low bone mineral density, fractures and bone pain . The risk of osteoporosis is likely to increase with age; however, this has not been well studied in patients with PK deficiency . Similar to other hemolytic disorders, pulmonary hypertension is a complication of PK deficiency . Leg ulcers have also been reported in patients with PK deficiency . Special considerations in pregnancy . Pregnancy in women with PK deficiency has been associated with excellent maternal and fetal outcomes . During pregnancy, the degree of hemolysis typically worsens and transfusion needs increase . The majority of women will be transfused during pregnancy and/or directly after the delivery, regardless of their transfusion status before pregnancy . A significant amount of iron is transferred from the mother to the fetus, which helps to balance the iron loading that could be associated with transfusions during the pregnancy . Complications in the newborn . Other complications . 
The patient's physical, psychological and biochemical status should be assessed thoroughly before considering treatment . Many cardiac arrhythmias are not life-threatening, and patients should be reassured accordingly . However, many, if not most, patients will require an evaluation in a cardiology or arrhythmia clinic . General treatment principles . When making any decision about initiating treatment, care must be taken to assess the benefits and risks . Reasons for treatment may include . risk of sudden death . The aim of treatment is to suppress symptoms, restore an acceptable quality of life and, if relevant, reduce the risk of sudden death . Intervention should provide long-term benefit and minimal or acceptable risks . This will help to determine whether treatment is required, and what the safest and most effective treatment would be . The options for treatment are . reassurance only (no active treatment) . pharmacological treatment (antiarrhythmic drug therapy) . Reassurance, no intervention . Some arrhythmias do not require any intervention . An echocardiogram is often necessary for patients with resistant or long-standing symptoms . Table 6.1 lists the features to explain to patients with normal ectopic beats . Atrial ectopy is generally benign . Occasionally, cognitive therapy is required . In many patients, however, quality of life can be severely adversely affected, requiring medical treatment with beta-blockers, occasionally the use of antiarrhythmic medications, or even consideration of ablation procedures . Such patients may have an increased risk of sudden death and require referral to a cardiologist . Pharmacological treatment . Classification of drugs . Although useful as a starting point, this requires extrapolation to specific arrhythmias . The Vaughan Williams classification is the most frequently used system of determining drug effect and action . Drugs often fit into more than one group, which can make their practical application confusing . All antiarrhythmic drugs have side effects, most of which are drug-specific . Class I drugs such as flecainide and propafenone should only be used where LV function is normal . Many scientific reports have shown arrhythmia suppression but at the expense of increased mortality . The extent to which drugs are negatively inotropic varies (Figure 6.2) . The aim of antiarrhythmic drug therapy is to suppress the frequency of paroxysmal arrhythmias . The drugs are not curative, so treatment tends to be lifelong and the drugs must be taken daily (some of them three times daily) . No drug taken orally is effective immediately, although some drugs can be useful when taken as soon as the arrhythmia begins . However, this should not be repeated continuously if the arrhythmia fails to terminate, as pretreatment with a drug may complicate any subsequent aggressive treatment such as DC cardioversion in hospital . Table 6.3 summarizes the drugs that can be used for specific arrhythmias . Ablation is the treatment of choice in women of childbearing age, as drug use may be too risky if they wish to conceive . Outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic agents is generally considered for patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and also in patients with paroxysmal AF . Non-pharmacological interventions . As a result, it is a safe and effective treatment for many arrhythmias . The procedure . The procedure . Patients are positioned and draped in the supine position . Success rates are high, recurrence is uncommon, the arrhythmia is often cured and lifelong drug therapy is no longer required . For accessory pathways as a whole, RFA is successful in 95% of cases as a first procedure . RFA of accessory pathways is the treatment of choice for all patients except for . patients who are reluctant to undergo ablation and prefer the use of an antiarrhythmic agent . Ablation of concealed pathways . Ablation of the slow pathway is performed . In general, RFA produces better long-term outcomes . Endocardial versus epicardial ablation . Although this can be a highly successful treatment for epicardial arrhythmias, it involves small but significant risks . Detraining may reduce arrhythmia burden in some of these patients . 
A brief history . We now know that MS is an inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease that affects multiple sites across the CNS . Clinically isolated syndrome . It is important to define the subtype of MS, as this will guide prognosis and choice of disease-modifying therapy . For example, therapies that reduce the frequency and severity of relapses may not be helpful to people with progressive disease . The recognized patterns of MS are . relapsing remitting . secondary progressive . primary progressive . progressive relapsing . Relapsing remitting disease is the most common form of MS, accounting for 65-70% of patients . In early disease, recovery after a relapse (remission) is often near complete, but incomplete recovery is common in established disease and in these instances patients with MS often accrue disability with each successive relapse (Figure 3.1) . Secondary progressive disease . In most cases (up to 75% of people with relapsing remitting disease) there is an eventual progression to the secondary progressive phase of MS . This is defined as an initial relapsing remitting disease course followed by progression with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions and plateaus (Figure 3.2) . Risk factors for progression to secondary progressive MS are shown in Table 3.1 . The progression of disease from relapsing remitting to the secondary progressive stage is usually noted retrospectively, for example when a patient with MS has accumulated disability over 6-12 months without any discrete episodes of relapse . Primary progressive disease comprises approximately 10-15% of patients with MS . Primary progressive MS typically has a later onset than relapsing remitting MS . Progressive relapsing disease . Progressive relapsing disease should therefore be differentiated from primary and secondary progressive disease . Recently, 'active' (clinical relapses or new/enhancing MRI lesions) and 'inactive' phenotypes of progressive MS have been proposed by an international working group . Patient history . Medical history . Other autoimmune diseases . As there is an association between MS and other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, vitiligo and inflammatory bowel disease, it is important to include questions about these when taking a history . It is therefore important to document any family history of MS or autoimmune diseases (which are often familial) . The onset of MS tends to be earlier in people with familial MS . Social history . Smoking is a risk factor for MS . Signs and symptoms . Lesions affecting the brainstem and cerebellar pathways are common in patients with MS, and can lead to poor coordination . Balance is commonly affected . Patients may complain of slurred speech . Sensory symptoms . Constipation is a common disturbance in the later stages of the disease . While it commonly reflects spinal disease, constipation can be exacerbated by medications and reduced mobility . Magnetic resonance imaging remains the most important investigation in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS . Monitoring the effects of treatment . Monitoring disease activity . Annual MRI is used in some MS centers to monitor for subclinical MS activity or radiological relapses; the ultimate goal is NEDA (no evidence of disease activity), id est the triad of no clinical relapses, no new MRI activity and no evidence of disease progression . These blood tests are normal/negative in MS, but in patients with MS mimics they may reveal evidence of . They are usually absent in ADEM, NMO and systemic disease with CNS manifestations . This entity may be difficult to differentiate from MS on both clinical and radiological grounds . Monitoring disease progression . In the later stages of the disease, when disability has progressed, reduced mobility can have significant effects on mortality . help needed with walking indoors . help needed with climbing stairs . help needed with toilet use . help needed with bathing . help needed with grooming . help needed with dressing . help needed with feeding . MRI is routinely used to monitor disease activity and progression and response to disease-modifying therapy . MRI findings at presentation can be useful for predicting disease progression . The rate of lesion growth was three times higher in those who developed secondary progressive MS than in those who remained relapsing remitting (Figure 3.16) . 
Type 2 diabetes occurs when insulin secretion is insufficient to meet insulin demand, resulting in hyperglycemia . The keys are insulin resistance in muscle (thereby increasing insulin demand), insulin resistance in liver (thereby increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis) and eventual beta cell failure with relative insulin deficiency (that is, unable to meet insulin demand) . While there is relative insulin deficiency in type 2 diabetes, it is rarely absolute deficiency as in type 1 diabetes, thus ketoacidosis does not occur with hyperglycemia . The symptoms of type 2 diabetes are outlined in Table 4.1 . Type 2 diabetes is often considered a lifestyle disease . This is a misunderstanding, as type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic background, stronger in fact than that for type 1 diabetes . In monozygotic twins, there is a 95% concordance for type 2 diabetes; in contrast, the concordance for type 1 diabetes is 30-50% . The genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes is, however, brought out very strongly by the environmental factors of a sedentary lifestyle, consumption of energy-dense foods and overweight or obesity . Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents hyperglycemia, the end stage of beta cell dysfunction, with numerous pathways to reach this endpoint . This has become evident as different genes have been found in different populations . Interestingly, most of the genes identified for type 2 diabetes concern the beta cell . This indicates that the genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes lies in a defect affecting insulin secretory capacity or the long-term ability to continue increased insulin secretion in the face of high demand or, perhaps, programming for long-term failure . Mutational forms of type 2 diabetes explain only a small proportion of cases, fewer than 2% . In contrast, a number of different genetic polymorphisms have been described in different populations that explain susceptibility to the commoner forms of type 2 diabetes . Environmental factors . Environmental factors play a major role in increasing diabetes risk . Modifying these environmental factors is the focus of international public health efforts to curb the increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes and is the cornerstone of treatment and/or prevention of type 2 diabetes . The effectiveness of this approach is best demonstrated by the Diabetes Prevention Program, in which increased physical activity and modest weight reduction reduced the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes by over 50% at 3 years . In certain ethnic groups, loss of traditional lifestyles and adoption of a western diet have had catastrophic effects on prevalence rates, with the majority of adults now affected by type 2 diabetes . Adoption of a western lifestyle has also increased the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes among Hispanic Americans and populations in Southern and South East Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific Islands . Insulin resistance is considered a central metabolic feature of many cases of type 2 diabetes . While it is often present in obesity-associated diabetes, it is not universal . In fact, insulin resistance is not present in many people with type 2 diabetes, particularly leaner individuals . It accompanies dyslipidemia characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and low-HDL cholesterol, which is often found in type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome . Insulin resistance is considered the link that explains the clustering of abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and dyslipidemia . Insulin resistance refers to the reduced ability of circulating insulin to result in cellular glucose uptake . Insulin acts by stimulating its receptor on the cell surface (Figure 4.1) . Overall, such perturbation results in a reduced glucose-uptake response to insulin (insulin resistance) . When the pancreatic beta cells can no longer produce sufficient insulin to overcome insulin resistance, blood glucose levels start to rise . Insulin resistance may occur at many points in the insulin signaling cascade . Rarely, genetic mutations within the insulin receptor or its substrate can result in insulin resistance . More frequently, increased circulating fatty acids (from nutrient excess or obesity) can interfere with insulin signaling through a mechanism termed lipotoxicity . These disturbances in inflammation add to the metabolic disturbances in the regulation of insulin signaling and contribute to insulin resistance . Insulin resistance is also found in the liver . With failing insulin secretion, there is insufficient insulin to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis, particularly overnight . Insulin secretion is further hindered by rising glucose levels which directly damage beta cells through a mechanism called glucotoxicity . Lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes is found in the muscle cells, where glucose is the major substrate . 
Epilepsy is not a single disease but an extensive collection of conditions with a wide range of underlying etiologies and pathologies, all sharing the common and fundamental characteristic of recurrent, usually unprovoked, seizures . Is the episode an epileptic seizure? . What is (are) the seizure type(s)? . A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures and must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 3.1) . Furthermore, non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (also called pseudoseizures) are estimated to occur in up to 45% of patients referred to specialist centers with apparently refractory epilepsy . This misidentification of non-epileptic conditions as epilepsy can lead to unnecessary treatments that are potentially harmful, and can delay the start of appropriate therapy . The temptation to attach a label of 'epilepsy' should be resisted if there is any doubt about the diagnosis despite a thorough evaluation . Both the physician and patient must simply await the passage of time before coming to a firm conclusion . Further challenges of diagnosis and management may arise in patients in whom non-epileptic events coexist with epileptic seizures or develop as a substitute for epileptic seizures once the epilepsy is controlled . Acute symptomatic seizures (also called provoked seizures) must be distinguished from unprovoked (epileptic) seizures . Acute symptomatic seizures occur in close temporal relationship (often arbitrarily defined as within 1 week) with an acute insult of the central nervous system (CNS), which may be metabolic, toxic, structural, traumatic, infectious or inflammatory . Common examples include seizures during an acute stroke, encephalitis or electrolyte disturbance . It has been estimated that up to 50% of all seizures may be considered to be acute symptomatic . There should be an adequate effort to search for any underlying acute CNS insult which may require urgent treatment . Unlike epileptic seizures, acute symptomatic seizures are not necessarily characterized by a tendency for recurrence . Clinical evaluation . Despite advances in investigational technologies, the diagnosis of epilepsy remains essentially clinical, and is based on a detailed description of the events experienced by the patient before, during and after a seizure . In addition to a full medical and social history, the patient should be asked about factors that may precipitate seizures by lowering the threshold for such an event (Table 3.3) . Investigations aiming to unearth anything that acutely provokes seizures should be guided by the clinical scenario . Investigational technologies . Electroencephalography can support the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and help with the classification of partial-onset or generalized seizures . It is important to give the electroencephalographer detailed information concerning the patient's age, seizure behavior and response to AEDs . Routine EEGs are often insensitive - more than 50% of patients with epilepsy will have a normal trace . Diagnostic yield can also be increased by repeat recordings . In a patient with suspected non-convulsive status epilepticus (see Chapter 7), an EEG can be diagnostic . Video-EEG telemetry . This investigation is mandatory as part of the evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and may be the only way to distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic seizures . In some situations, it usefully identifies candidates for surgery among patients with normal neuroimaging results . Brain imaging . Structural imaging . Imaging studies of the brain to look for underlying structural abnormalities are essential for the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of most patients with epilepsy, particularly those presenting with partial-onset seizures . For patients in mid-life and beyond, scans are helpful in evaluating stroke and cerebral degeneration, and in identifying primary and secondary neoplasia . Any patient with refractory epilepsy in whom the initial MRI scan is normal should have a high-resolution scan to exclude hippocampal atrophy and focal cortical dysplasia . worsening in the patient's neurological or cognitive function . increase in the frequency or severity of the seizures . Functional imaging can identify focal abnormalities in cerebral physiology even when structural imaging results are normal . Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate increased blood flow in brain regions in association with seizure activity . Functional neuroimaging techniques have a limited role in routine diagnostic evaluation, but are useful adjuncts in the work-up for epilepsy surgery . 
This personalized medicine approach has a large effect on patient survival . Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation . However, there is no consensus about which inhibitor will maximize therapeutic efficacy in NSCLC patients with the EGFR mutation . In Caucasian patients, this strategy reported better outcome among T790M de novo-positive patients than T790M-negative patients (16 vs 10.5 months) . After treatment with EGFR-TKI, tumors invariably develop acquired resistance (AR) . Osimertinib has reported an RR of 61% and median PFS of 9.6 months in patients with T790M-positive NSCLC with AR to EGFR-TKI, and has been approved by the FDA . Rociletinib has also reported an RR of 53% and PFS of 8 months in this population . ALK rearrangements (ALK +) result from inversions or translocations on chromosome 2 in about 5% of patients with NSCLC . No benefit in OS was reported because of crossover . The central nervous system (CNS) is the most common site of relapse or progression in patients taking crizotinib . It has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with pretreated ALK + NSCLC (RR 56%, PFS 6.9 months) and in naive patients (RR 72%, PFS 18.4 months), even in patients with intracranial disease . Clinical data from a phase I/II trial investigating brigatinib (AP26113) in 78 patients with ALK+ NSCLC pretreated with crizotinib, reported a RR of 71%, PFS of 13.4 months and 1-year OS of 100% . The ALTA-1L trial will compare brigatinib with crizotinib as first-line treatment . Alectinib had a reponse rate of 48% in a phase II trial in patients pretreated with crizotinib, with a median PFS of 8.9 months and clinical activity in patients with brain metastases (BM) . In crizotinib-naive patients, alectinib has demonstrated an RR of 94% and median PFS of 27 months . The ongoing phase III AXEL trial is comparing alectinib with crizotinib in treatment-naive patients . Other actionable alterations in NSCLC . The V600E mutation accounts for 50% of cases . Vemurafenib has demonstrated a response rate of 42% and median PFS of 7.3 months in a cohort of 20 patients with pretreated BRAF V600E NSCLC . In a phase II study, dabrafenib demonstrated activity in patients with pretreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive NSCLC, with a RR of 32% and median PFS of 5.5 months . Crizotinib was tested in 50 patients with the ROS1 rearrangement . The response rate was 72% with a median PFS of 19.2 months . In a European cohort of ROS1 patients, crizotinib reported an 80% response rate and median PFS of 9.1 months . RET rearrangements occur in 1-2% of patients with NSCLC, especially in never smokers . A small phase II study with cabozantinib reported a 44% response rate and median PFS of 7 months in 16 patients with RET fusions . In mouse models, alectinib has reported activity in RET -rearranged NSCLC tumors . MET amplification/mutation . Crizotinib has shown clinical activity in high MET -amplified NSCLC . In a French cohort of 18 patients with pretreated MET -amplified NSCLC, crizotinib had a RR of 39% . HER2 mutations occur in about 2% of lung adenocarcinomas . In a European cohort of 101 patients with HER2 exon-20 insertion NSCLC, HER2 therapies achieved a 50.9% RR and median PFS of 4.8 months . Dacomitinib has also demonstrated activity in this population (12% RR in patients with HER2 mutations vs 0% in HER2 -amplified patients, with median OS of 9 months in the HER2 -mutant subgroup) . NTRK1 and NTRK2 rearrangements occur in 1-2% of patients with NSCLC . Entrectinib has had promising results in this subpopulation of lung cancer patients . 
The possibility of harnessing the immune system to attack cancer cells was first proposed over 100 years ago, but effective immunotherapies have until recently proved elusive because of the ability of cancer cells to evade the immune system . Indeed, as noted in the previous chapter, this ability can be considered one of the defining features of cancer . How tumors evade immune attack . Tumor cells can block immune responses in a number of ways . Cancer cell antigens may not be recognized by dendritic cells or APCs . Cancer antigens may be treated as self-antigens, rather than foreign, leading to regulatory T cell (T reg) responses rather than cancer-specific effector responses . T cells may not be trafficked to the tumor, or are prevented from infiltrating the tumor . The PD-1 receptor pathway . The PD-1 receptor on the surface of T cells plays an important role in regulating the recruitment and activation of T cells, and overexpression of this receptor's ligand, PD-L1, by cancer cells has been reported in several types of cancer, including melanoma and cancers of the lung, kidney, head and neck, and colon . Binding of this receptor to its ligand, PD-L1, can affect the immune response to cancer cells in two ways . In the lymph nodes, overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor-infiltrating immune cells can prevent the priming and activation of new cytotoxic T cells, and subsequently prevent recruitment of these immune cells to the tumor . Within the tumor microenvironment, up-regulation of PD-L1 on cancer cells and immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells leads to deactivation of cytotoxic T cells . Consequently, CTLA-4 is an important immune checkpoint and target for cancer immunotherapy . In particular, the effects of PD-1 are largely confined to the tumor site: expression of PD-L1 is low in non-cancerous tissue . In addition, the stimulation of agonistic receptors on T cells promotes activation of T cells . Further understanding of the biology of immune regulation in cancer will define optimal targets and combinations for therapeutic interventions . Tumors are complex structures consisting of multiple cell types that create a constantly evolving immunosuppressive microenvironment (Figure 2.6) . This microenvironment can inhibit immune responses and promote tumor growth through a number of mechanisms (Table 2.2) . In addition to the cancer cells themselves, a number of different cell types may contribute to the tumor microenvironment (see Figure 2.6) . These include . endothelial cells, particularly those in the tumor blood vessels, which play an important role in tumor angiogenesis . pericytes, a specialized mesenchymal cell type related to smooth muscle cells, that support the tumor endothelium . immune inflammatory cells, including cells with tumor-promoting activities, such as macrophage subtypes, mast cells and neutrophils, and partially differentiated myeloid progenitor cells . cancer-associated fibroblasts . stem and progenitor cells in the tumor stroma . The aim of immuno-oncology therapies is to restore the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells . inhibiting the suppression of the immune system by tumors . The cancer immunity cycle . The response of the immune system to cancer cells is a cyclical process (Figure 2.1) that may in principle be self-perpetuating, leading to a heightened immune response . Initially, cancer cells are detected by natural killer (NK) cells, which interact with specific ligands on the cancer cell surface, leading to the destruction of the cancer cells . This causes the release of cancer antigens that bind to dendritic cells or other antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to cytokine secretion by APCs and priming the activation of T cells in lymphoid tissue . These cytotoxic T cells are transported to the tumor, where they bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins on the cancer cell surface and kill the target cancer cells . This in turn leads to further release of antigens, thereby amplifying the immune response . In addition to allowing the tumor cell to evade immune attack, these mechanisms may actually facilitate tumor progression . Immunoediting of cancer cells: the 'three Es' . 
A wide QRS can occur if . due to re-entry from a scar or substrate caused by a previous myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease, occurring most often in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (see Figure 1.11) . as a focal abnormality in a structurally normal heart . It is important that a patient is not made worse when treatment is initiated following the diagnosis . It is therefore generally safer to assume that all regular QRS tachycardias are VT and to initiate treatment on that basis in the first instance . (A patient with supraventricular tachycardia [SVT] treated for VT may not get better immediately but is unlikely to get worse . Usually this diagnostic challenge is not necessary, however, as knowledge of simple clinical features, such as whether the patient has had a previous myocardial infarction, makes VT likely . Emergency treatment . If the patient is hemodynamically compromised, rapid direct-current cardioversion is appropriate, although sedation or anesthesia will be needed if the patient is conscious . Once the patient is stabilized, other investigations are mandatory to ascertain the best long-term treatment . The arrhythmia usually identifies the presence of a significant arrhythmia substrate and a continuing risk of arrhythmia and, potentially, sudden death . If the patient is not hemodynamically compromised, administration of an agent such as lidocaine (lignocaine) or amiodarone is appropriate . Amiodarone has multiple antiarrhythmic actions and is the most potent agent for VT currently available . General treatment principles . The key questions to consider in managing a patient with VT are . Does the patient have a continuing propensity for the arrhythmia? . Does this arrhythmia reflect structural heart disease? . VT in the structurally normal heart . Patients occasionally complain of exercise-induced palpitations, with symptoms typically emerging just after vigorous exercise . Rarely, patients may present with idiopathic VT from the left ventricular summit or left ventricular fascicular VT . The commonest site for fascicular VT is the posterior fascicle, which presents with right bundle left-axis VT (Figure 10.3) . This VT is most often seen in men, is occasionally exercise-related and may show sensitivity to calcium-channel blockers . If patients have a structurally normal heart and the arrhythmia is a 'normal heart VT' they can be treated symptomatically, using medication such as beta-blockers or curative catheter ablation (which has become the treatment of choice for this focal arrhythmia) . Providing the patient is not syncopal, sudden death is rare . The 'normal heart VTs' are usually autonomically dependent and may be difficult to induce during electrophysiological study . In some cases, isoprenaline (isoproterenol) infusion is required to induce the arrhythmia . Even if it is inducible, the VT may not be sustained and so prolonged mapping of the arrhythmia may not be possible . If VT cannot be reliably sustained, then an alternative strategy is pace-mapping . During ablation at the correct site there is often an accelerated burst of VT (automaticity), which is extinguished during continued ablation . The VT is calcium-dependent and therefore verapamil-sensitive, and is best treated by catheter ablation . VT with structural heart disease . Patients with evidence of myocardial scarring or a diffuse electrical abnormality are at significant risk of further episodes and sudden death . Occasionally, patients with these conditions present with VT storms with frequent episodes of polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation that are difficult to manage and may require multiple direct-current shocks . Beta-blockers and amiodarone are usually started, and are the mainstay of treatment, but occasionally patients continue to have recurrent episodes despite treatment . The ICD is extremely effective in a secondary prevention role and is the cornerstone of treatment . However, catheter ablation can be effective at reducing or eliminating ICD shocks in patients with scar-related VT . In these patients, mapping and ablation are usually performed during sinus rhythm in order to avoid the prolonged hypotension usually present during VT, especially with underlying left ventricular dysfunction and general anesthesia . The ablation strategy is very different from SVT ablation (Table 10.1) . 
The overall goals of any treatment program for psoriasis must be to . improve the patient's quality of life . achieve long-term remission and disease control . reduce individual drug toxicity . carefully evaluate individual treatments and monitor their cost-effectiveness . In the USA, approximately 50% of patients with psoriasis are not under the care of a physician, probably because . they are frustrated by the lack of understanding and insight into this chronic, highly visible disease, leading to poor patient compliance, especially with topical therapy . remission periods are short with most current therapies . physicians fail to plan treatment/spend time with patients in consultation and discussion . systemic therapy is underutilized for patients with moderate-to-severe disease . Many patients who present with mild psoriasis do not necessarily want active therapy - a diagnosis and reassurance may be sufficient, particularly given that available treatments do not alter the natural history or activity of the disease . Individualizing patient care . It is important to determine the aspects of psoriasis that trouble a patient most, as the degree to which psoriasis affects a person's daily life does not necessarily correlate with objective scores of disease severity . Factors in the patient's social history can contribute to disease severity or affect treatment outcome and, although sometimes difficult to change, it is important to recognize such factors in terms of overall disease management . Treatment of coexisting illnesses, particularly acute respiratory infections in younger patients, is important to reduce the risk of an acute flare-up of pre-existing psoriasis . Available treatments . Treatments available for psoriasis include a wide range of topical therapies, phototherapy (including photochemotherapy, see Chapter 6) and a variety of systemic agents, some with potentially significant side effects (see Chapter 7) . Many factors influence the choice of therapy for an individual (Table 4.1) . Approximately 70% of patients with psoriasis can be managed using topical therapy alone . Managing patient expectations . Before beginning therapy, the patient should have a realistic expectation of the outcome . In practice, this means explaining that treatment will be lengthy and is not curative, and that the psoriasis is likely to relapse if therapy is discontinued . precisely what a treatment is designed to achieve and how . where and for how long therapy should be applied . Rotational, combined and sequential therapies . An impressive array of treatments for all forms of psoriasis, whether mild, moderate or severe, is now available . By convention, topical therapy is the preferred first-line treatment for psoriasis . At present, if the response to topical therapy is inadequate, most dermatologists try phototherapy next . However, particularly in the UK and Europe, systemic drugs are now being introduced earlier in treatment algorithms . This partly reflects growing concerns about phototherapy carcinogenicity, but also the increasing realization that psoriasis is a systemic disease (see pages 26 -) and as such requires systemic management . Psoriasis is a chronic disease that requires long-term therapy, which raises the potential problem of cumulative toxicities . In practice, most rotational and sequential therapy relates to topical treatment . Rotational therapy . The rationale behind elective rotational therapy is that minimizing the duration of drug exposure will minimize the risk of drug-related toxicity . Other investigators have since added other treatments to the rotation and lengthened the duration of the individual treatments . For example, a patient could theoretically be maintained on methotrexate for several years and, as the cumulative dose neared 1.5 g, could then be rotated to another treatment . Later, as initial signs of hypertension and nephrotoxicity developed with ciclosporin, the patient could be rotated to phototherapy . Other reasons to rotate therapy include side effects, loss of efficacy and onset of a new flare . Combination therapy . The rationale for elective combination therapy is that combining drugs (with non-overlapping modes of action and side effects) minimizes the dose of each agent and thus minimizes toxicity . In practice, this represents a very useful treatment strategy . Combination therapy is often required for long-term control of psoriasis, as for rheumatoid disease . Various combinations of topical, systemic and light treatment may be needed to clear localized resistant patches and reduce the need for sustained longer-term systemic therapy . Sequential therapy . 
duration of pain > 3 months . improvement in pain with exercise (and deterioration with rest) . Pain intensity . The VAS measures pain on a horizontal 10-cm line, where 0 is no pain and 10 cm is the greatest pain ever (Figure 1.1) . A pain drawing is also useful in determining the pattern of the pain and possibly its etiology (Figure 1.2) . These two assessments are the simplest, least time-dependent and least threatening of the tests available . Pain duration . Psychological assessment . The more chronic the low back pain disorder, the greater the impact of psychological factors is likely to be . A variety of tests can be used to categorize and document personality and cognitive behavioral functioning, exempli gratia whether the patient manifests inappropriate symptom amplification or other psychological disorders . This is a comprehensive psychological test that characterizes hypochondriasis, depression and hysteria . Although psychological assessment is carried out as an integral part of the clinical evaluation of patients with chronic low back pain, more detailed assessment may be indicated if an individual is resistant to improvement . Gait assessment . Neurological testing . The sequence of neurological testing is arbitrary . The Romberg test for peripheral neuropathy and balance can be performed at any time the patient is standing, or at the same time as gait or functional muscle tests . The Babinski test for upper motor neuron dysfunction can be performed in conjunction with the ankle jerk reflex test, or when vibratory sensation is tested . The patient can be tested seated or supine without stockings . Pain is a variable contributor, depending on its intensity and the patient's movement . Examination pointers . Diffuse pain is usually a function of pain severity . Spinal nerve impingement and hip joint testing . The straight leg raise is the classic test for nerve impingement of two lower nerve roots, L5 and S1 (Figure 1.10) . The patient should be supine with the 'good' leg and knee extended on the examining table . This is also the case in patients with milder forms of sciatica, who may initially be unresponsive to straight leg raising until the tested leg reaches 50-70° . Tight hamstring muscles, when stretched, can cause pain to be referred to the thighs, thus greatly reducing the usefulness of the test . A straight leg raise test with the patient seated that does not provoke radicular leg pain after the patient was strongly positive on the conventional supine straight leg raise test is considered to be an indicator of malingering or, perhaps more politely, gross exaggeration . The Lasègue test also detects lumbar nerve root impingements (Figure 1.11) . The involved leg is supported and slowly extended to test for sciatic irritability . Although it is more difficult to measure the degree of leg raising, thereby making this test less precise, it still provides a useful alternative to the straight leg raise test for patients who could not otherwise be tested . The femoral nerve stretch test is designed to detect nerve root irritability in the L2-L4 nerve roots (Figure 1.12) . Pain and/or dysesthesias radiating down the front of the thigh is indicative of nerve root impingement . Like the crossed straight leg test, the crossed femoral nerve stretch test has enhanced specificity for nerve root impingement . The key nerve roots that are usually tested first are . Muscle testing . The aim of muscle testing is to note muscle atrophy and to assess . muscle function . Functional muscle testing is usually the quickest and easiest to perform unless the patient is in too great discomfort, in which case reliance must be placed on the manual muscle test (see below) . The patient can be readily monitored for pain, imbalance, arthropathies and deformities while assessing possible weakness . Functional muscle strength . The patient is then asked to stand on the toes of both feet . Manual muscle testing . The muscle groups tested functionally can also be evaluated by manual muscle tests, which are particularly valuable for patients who cannot perform the functional tests . The patient is asked to resist the examiner's pressure . The muscle groups tested are a function of the patient's symptoms . Those most readily tested are . Manual muscle strength testing is at best a subjective evaluation, depending on the examiner's grading in conjunction with the patient's cooperation . Clinical assessment . 
The incidence of AML increases with age (Figure 3.1) . The fact that AML predominantly affects elderly patients, who may not be tolerant of intensive treatment, has major implications for management . AML is more likely to be diagnosed in developed countries and is more common in whites than in other groups . Mortality from AML is highest among people aged 75-84 years: 51% of AML deaths in the UK each year are in people aged 75 and over (2012-2014) . In the UK in 2014, AML accounted for 2% of all cancer deaths . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia . ALL commonly affects younger people, with over 50% of patients being under the age of 20 (see Figure 3.1) . Chronic myeloid leukemia . Since the discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the survival rates with this leukemia have increased dramatically . The 5-year relative survival rate increased from 17% in 1975 to 64% in 2009 . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia . The incidence of CLL increases with age (see Figure 3.1), and the median age of diagnosis is 70 years . However, because of the indolent nature of this leukemia, the 5-year survival rate is about 83% . There is a slight predominance of white male patients . There also appears to be an increased risk of developing CLL and other lymphoid malignancies in patients with relatives who have CLL; there is an 8.5-fold risk of developing CLL if a relative also has CLL . Etiology and risk factors . Like most cancers, the main risk factor for AML, CML and CLL is age, and so with an aging population the prevalence of these conditions increases . Despite the presence of certain etiologic factors, the major reason for the development of most leukemias is the accumulation of genetic mutations as a person ages . Many different gene mutations can lead to leukemia . Both AML and B-cell ALL can be subtyped on the basis of recurrent genetic mutations (see Chapter 2) . The presence of pre-existing populations of cells that place individuals at risk for developing leukemia has also long been recognized . This suggests that in some patients, RUNX1-ETO fusion occurs in utero, and pre-dates the development of frank leukemia . The risk of developing AML from MDS is highly variable: prediction can be based on a number of scoring systems . The risk of developing AML affects the overall survival of patients with MDS . Patients with MBL are asymptomatic and have no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly . In a prospective study of over 77 000 apparently healthy people over 60 years old, 45 patients eventually developed CLL . In one study in which exome sequencing was performed in over 12 000 patients without hematologic malignancies, 10% of patients over the age of 65 had at least one mutation suggesting clonal hematopoiesis . These findings have many implications, including how these results are explained to patients and how they should be monitored . Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of both ALL and AML . The risk differs according to age, and is greatest in early childhood . However, a subset of patients with TAM subsequently develop AML . All patients with TAM have an N-terminal-truncating mutation in the transcription factor gene GATA1 . The accumulation of other gene mutations, including those that encode the cohesin complex, results in the development of AML (Figure 3.2) . Inherited predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia . As described above, most cases of AML are sporadic, arising as a result of the steady accumulation of mutations in somatic cells . However, a small but increasingly well-recognized subset of patients with AML have a germline inherited genetic predisposition to AML . An example of one such group of disorders encompasses patients with mutations in the transcription factor GATA2 gene . In these patients, germline heterozygous mutations in GATA2 result in a predisposition to MDS and AML . Environmental risk factors . Patients may develop secondary AML after chemotherapy or radiotherapy for other malignancies . These forms of AML are known as therapy-associated AML and patients tend to have adverse-risk cytogenetics . 
Early smoking experiences . The irritancy of nicotine and other components of smoke in the airways usually causes coughing and sore throat on initial exposure . Some first-time smokers experience a pleasurable sensation as well . Adaptation to the acute unpleasant effects of smoking occurs quickly, and within a few weeks or months novice smokers are able to tolerate as much nicotine from each cigarette as habitual smokers . Long-term health effects of smoking . Those who are killed by smoking die an average of 20 years sooner than they would have done otherwise . Smoking also causes long-term disability, both in those who are eventually killed by cigarette smoking and in those who ultimately die from some other cause . The average smoker who fails to stop can expect to develop diseases of old age many years earlier than a non-smoker . The following sections discuss some of the more common causes of death associated with smoking . Smoking accounts for the vast majority of cases of lung cancer worldwide . The risk of lung cancer is 15 times greater for a smoker than for a non-smoker . The risk accumulates over time and is related to both daily cigarette consumption and duration of smoking . Both are usually caused by smoking . Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and a major cause of long-term disability in western societies . Unlike the risk for lung cancer, cardiovascular risk is not directly proportional to overall smoke exposure . Approximately half the increased risk occurs even with very light smoking, and the risk curve flattens somewhat above about 10 cigarettes per day . Even non-daily smokers incur significant cardiovascular risk . Recent research has found that smoking as few as three cigarettes per day increases the risk of heart attack . Multiple studies have shown immediate and dramatic drops in heart attacks among non-smokers when smoking is banned in public places . Other life-threatening diseases . Even now, science is discovering new contributions that smoking makes to diseases not initially considered related to smoking . There was a view in the 1990s that smoking was protective against Alzheimer's disease . We now know that smoking is an important risk factor for both Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's dementia . Non-life-threatening diseases . The number of disorders known to be linked to smoking is growing . Smoking can also have an effect on various treatment regimens or medical conditions . Smoking and reproduction . It is widely known that maternal smoking during pregnancy reduces birth weight . The mechanism linking smoking with these consequences has not been clearly established . Fertility is impaired by smoking in both women and men . Smoking is also an important cause of miscarriage, the risk being several times higher than in non-smokers when other known risk factors are controlled for . Also, there is evidence that smoking (and possibly any form of nicotine use) during pregnancy increases the subsequent risk of sudden infant death syndrome (crib or cot death) . Effects of nicotine . Nicotine does not cause cancer . The main effects of nicotine are on the autonomic nervous systems and CNS and are caused by its action at synapses . Larger doses produce larger effects . In the brain, nicotine has a wide range of both acute and chronic effects . At smoking doses it initially increases ACh release in the cortex and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens . Acute effects of stopping smoking . Nicotine increases the heart rate acutely; it decreases again when nicotine is eliminated from the body . Another 'offset effect' is an increase in skin temperature . Smoking also leads to an increase in tremor, due to a nicotine-induced increase in sympathetic activation . The cause is not known, and the effect is relatively uncommon, but when it occurs it can cause considerable discomfort . It is probably unrelated to nicotine . Some smokers report coughs and sore throats when they stop smoking . Some smokers are very concerned about putting on weight if they quit smoking . It seems to deter many people from attempting to stop smoking . However, there is no clear evidence that stopping smoking places smokers at greater risk of developing depression . It is widely believed that smoking helps to relieve stress and anxiety, and that anxiety levels increase during abstinence . However, current evidence demonstrates that smoking does not actually help to reduce the stress . There is some evidence for a brief increase in anxiety when smokers stop smoking, but anxiety and stress levels soon fall to below their smoking level . 
Developments in pain management . Novel analgesics . These agents will more specifically target receptor subtypes or ion channels, and promise to be more effective and better tolerated than present therapies . Other novel molecules are designed to interact with multiple receptors simultaneously . Advances in delivery . Iontophoretic or inhalational technology now permits the delivery of lipophilic opioids into the systemic circulation through the skin or lungs . No doubt we will be using pharmacogenetics to prescribe analgesics in the future . Defining pain . Global health burden . Mechanisms of pain . In fact, all three domains almost certainly exert their influence at various levels of the nervous system, with much overlap . A stimulus of intensity sufficient to threaten tissue damage activates nociceptors, which are specialized nerve endings . The transduction process for the remaining category of noxious stimuli associated with pressure will likely soon be elucidated . The PNS and CNS do not passively transduce stimuli and convey sensory information . Instead, noxious stimuli trigger biological processes that then amplify or inhibit the noxious signal . These protein kinases also activate other proteins such as ion channels and enzymes (Figure 1.3) . Pain is more than the nociceptive cascade described above . Because it is an experience, pain itself cannot be measured directly . Mechanisms of neuropathic pain . Neuropathic pain is initiated or caused by a primary lesion of the PNS or CNS . For example, a light touch may be described as painful . Several neuropathic pain syndromes share overlapping pathogenic mechanisms . Among other classifications, pathogenic mechanisms can be considered as either peripheral or central . Peripheral nerve injury produces axonal membrane hyper-excitability that leads to spontaneous generation of ectopic impulses . Abeta fibers rather than C fibers show the greatest degree of spontaneous ectopic discharge after peripheral nerve injury . Abeta fibers are specialized for light touch and are therefore likely to mediate the allodynia experienced after nerve injury . These mediators are produced by macrophages that migrate to sites of nerve injury and contribute to chronic inflammation in their immediate environment . Central effects of peripheral nerve injury . Reorganization of neurons . Abeta fibers develop abnormal connections with the nociceptive neurons of the dorsal horn . In addition, nerve injury triggers glial activation . At least nine anti-glial drugs are being evaluated . AV411 (or MN-166, ibudilast) inhibits astrocytes . In 2016, it received 'fast track' designation by the FDA for its potential use in multiple sclerosis (MS) . It has been successful in two of three clinical trials for neuropathic pain in humans . Sativex is approved in many countries for the treatment of spasticity in people with MS . Loss of inhibition . Moreover, after nerve injury there is also a loss of spinal inhibitory control . Genetics and pain . Improvements in genetic tools, particularly transgenic knockout mice and microarray-based gene expression profiling, have advanced understanding in this area . In the former, genetic engineering of embryonic stem cell DNA is used to produce a mouse that does not express the target gene . Variability in pain response . People report almost ninefold variability in pain intensity in response to a standardized stimulus . Specific single gene-related abnormalities in pain experience have been identified in humans . Genetic links have been reported for a number of conditions, including hereditary sensory neuropathy type II and familial hemiplegic migraine . Presumably, the development of Na V 1.7 blockers will lead to an effective treatment . Memory and pain . Such learning processes are accompanied by neuroplasticity changes at multiple levels of the nervous system . Extinction (unlearning) plays a key role in keeping neuroplasticity changes in check after nerve injury . Such treatment may be via behavioral, pharmacological or neurostimulation techniques, or a combination of these . Innovations in all three of these treatment areas already show promise . The brain and pain . In a landmark study by Coghill et al . Neuroplastic brain changes probably parallel learning and memory processes . Pain chronification . Every patient requires interventions tailored to change this trajectory or reverse its outcomes . 
Traditionally, it was believed that ovarian cancers usually originated in the surface epithelium of the ovaries . Although this theory supports the genesis of low-grade serous carcinoma, recent studies indicate that high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most common histological subtype of ovarian cancer, originates in the fimbria of the fallopian tubes (Figure 2.1) . Precancerous lesions, called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) have been found on the fimbria in 5-10% of women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations undergoing risk-reducing surgery and in up to 60% of unselected women with pelvic HGSC . For this reason, the term 'ovarian cancer' should be considered a collective term that covers all ovarian-fallopial tube and primary peritoneal cancers . Ovarian cancer cells tend to exfoliate into the peritoneum, where circulation of peritoneal fluid distributes them to the peritoneal surfaces and omentum . Indeed, intraperitoneal dissemination is the most characteristic feature of ovarian cancer; malignant cells can implant anywhere in the peritoneal cavity, particularly at sites of stasis within the peritoneal fluid circulation system . The disease can spread via a number of mechanisms, including . local extension . lymphatic invasion . hematogenous dissemination . transdiaphragmatic passage . The World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of epithelial ovarian cancer is summarized in Figure 2.2 . Epithelial tumors are the most common form of ovarian cancer, and the main focus of this book . The WHO classification for other forms of ovarian cancer are summarized in Table 2.1 and discussed in Chapter 9 . Epithelial tumors include benign, borderline and malignant histologies . Borderline tumors are a separate tumor entity characterized by complex papillary architecture, stratified epithelium with tufting (apparent detachment of cell clusters from their sites of origin), moderate nuclear abnormalities and moderately increased mitotic activity; in contrast to malignant tumors, they do not show stromal invasion . The pathological characteristics of borderline tumors are . total microinvasive area < 10 mm . depth of invasion <= 3 mm . Epithelial cancers account for 80-90% of all malignant ovarian neoplasms,, of which HGSCs account for 70-74%, endometrioid tumors for 7-24% and clear cell carcinomas for 10-26% (Figure 2.3) . These are indolent, slow-growing tumors that usually respond poorly to platinum-based chemotherapy . Although they are usually fatal, prolonged survival may be achievable in some patients . High-grade serous tumors are more common than low-grade tumors, and are believed to develop from STICs (see above) . These are aggressive tumors that initially respond well to platinum-based therapy, but typically recur . 
Sudden cardiac death (SCD), also known as sudden cardiac arrest, continues to represent a significant healthcare problem . There are more than 350 000 deaths every year from sudden cardiac arrest in the USA, accounting for more than 50% of all cardiovascular causes of death in the USA, and it is estimated that 6 million die from it annually worldwide . With increasing recognition of the condition and rapid application of resuscitation by bystanders, more people are surviving and making it to hospital . As a result, the overall survival rates of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have increased dramatically, particularly in some parts of the world, such as Seattle, where survival rates have increased significantly . SCD is defined according to whether it was witnessed or not . If it was witnessed, unexpected death must have occurred within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms; if it was not witnessed, unexpected death must have occurred within 24 hours of the patient last being observed without symptoms . There are many potential causes of SCD (Table 4.1) . SCD usually occurs in individuals with underlying cardiac disease and occurs more frequently with male sex and increasing age . In patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular or myocardial abnormalities, SCD can be the first presentation of the patient . An acute coronary syndrome can lead to ventricular fibrillation (VF) in a patient not previously known to have cardiac disease . Alternatively, a patient who has had coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the past may present years later with a new ischemic event leading to SCD . Metabolic causes associated with SCD include electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs and medication can also cause fatal rhythm disturbances (see Chapter 10) . An increasing number of syndromes are recognized as being associated with SCD . The major cause of sudden death in advanced countries remains ischemic and hypertensive heart disease . Sudden cardiac death in the young . A structural abnormality, usually secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is present in the majority (80%) of younger patients (aged <= 35 years) affected by SCD . Coronary artery anomalies occur rarely . Cardiac electrical disorders account for fewer than 10% of cases and include arrhythmogenic disorders such as long QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, idiopathic VF and Brugada syndrome . Postmortem examination often reveals no evidence of demonstrable cardiac pathology; the death of the patient is often classified as of unknown etiology . Indeed, sudden death is often the sentinel event, and postmortem examination is required to determine the cause of death . Although this may reveal a non-cardiac cause, such as asthma, epilepsy or pulmonary embolism, SCD is the principal cause of sudden death in young people, and structural cardiovascular abnormalities are often evident on postmortem examination . Sudden unexplained death . Not infrequently, there are no causes found either before or after an episode of SCD to explain why the patient collapsed and required resuscitation . In these patients, infrequent or rare syndromes, such as long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome or repolarization abnormalities, were undiagnosed or unknown to the patients . There are also patients who have idiopathic VF where no cause is apparent . All of these patients receive a defibrillator . Catheter ablation is also emerging as a treatment option in patients with Brugada syndrome (see Chapter 11) . Genetic testing should include blood samples of family members of patients who have survived an unexplained cardiac arrest . If patients do not survive a cardiac arrest, a molecular postmortem examination, consisting of blood and tissue samples, should be carried out whenever possible . Resuscitation and hospital care after cardiac arrest . Modern acute coronary care units and intensive care facilities are well prepared for the patient arriving following a cardiac arrest or with a return of spontaneous circulation . CPR - administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Bystanders to patients with SCD can start resuscitation measures, and in some communities new smartphone software alerts individuals who are able to give such help that a cardiac arrest has occurred near their location . Typically, a patient is admitted after receiving multiple shocks from their defibrillator, but patients may be under monitoring following an admission to hospital and require repeated defibrillation due to electrical instability . These patients are at particularly high risk of dying, and require immediate therapeutic measures . 
Mixed incontinence refers to the coexistence of stress incontinence with urgency incontinence symptoms . In surveys of older women, mixed and urgency incontinence predominate, whereas stress incontinence is generally the dominant symptom in young and middle-aged women . Most women manage UI on their own, with the minority (30-45%) seeking medical help . It is generally agreed that the prevalence is less than half that in women . Diagnosis and assessment . Urodynamic assessment is appropriate for all patients in whom surgical treatment is being considered and in patients with complex symptoms that do not respond to simple behavioral or conservative measures or drug treatments . Management in women . Treatment should initially be conservative and can be implemented without recourse to urodynamic assessment . Pelvic floor muscle exercises . The pelvic floor muscles support the bladder neck, rectum and vagina (Figure 3.1) . Exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor, and therefore improve support of the bladder neck, were first described by Dr Arnold Kegel in 1948 . The aims are to promote patient awareness and to improve the contractility and coordination of pelvic floor muscles, especially in women with weak pelvic floor muscles . Exercise regimens concentrate on both contraction strength and muscle endurance . The exercises described in Table 3.3 should be taught by a healthcare professional who has expertise in behavioral treatment for pelvic floor disorders (exempli gratia nurse specialist, physiotherapist) . A pelvic floor muscle assessment should be performed to ensure correct technique . Improvement should be observed within 2-4 months . Biofeedback training, which uses instruments to convert the effect of a pelvic floor muscle contraction into a visual or auditory response, allows patients and healthcare professionals to observe improvement in strength and bulk of the pelvic floor muscle in an objective manner . Pelvic floor muscle or transvaginal electrical stimulation with an electrode (vaginal, rectal, skin surface) can be useful if the initial pelvic floor muscle contraction is weak . Weighted vaginal cones can help women to identify the muscles of the pelvic floor (Figure 3.3) . Pharmacological treatment . Duloxetine hydrochloride is a combined serotonin and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor which is approved in Europe for the treatment of stress incontinence in women . It may be more effective if combined with pelvic floor muscle exercises . Surgery for stress incontinence in women should be considered only after the cause of the incontinence has been definitely ascertained . Women need to be adequately counseled about the risks and benefits of surgery for stress incontinence so that they can make an informed decision before embarking on this sort of surgery . The gold-standard procedure for treating stress incontinence used to be colposuspension (described below), which is major surgery that necessitates a lengthy hospital stay and has a prolonged recovery time . The principle underlying the procedure is that stress incontinence is caused by failure of the pubourethral ligaments . Other types of sling are also available . Colposuspension provides long-term cure in 70-80% of women at 10 years . Most would agree that sling insertion or colposuspension should be postponed for women who want to have more children . Bulking agents can be injected under local anesthesia and provide a treatment for women who are unfit to undergo general anesthesia or for whom a sling insertion or colposuspension are not suitable . Other procedures . Historically a number of other operations have been used to treat stress incontinence in women . Stamey procedure . Marshall-Marchetti-Krantz (MMK) procedure . It is therefore important that women with mixed symptoms receive adequate counseling before consenting to surgery . Stress incontinence after radical prostatectomy usually improves spontaneously . Initial management involves strengthening the pelvic floor musculature with exercises (see Table 3.3) . Most patients improve over a period of weeks or months without the need for further investigation or treatment . injection of bulking agents into the sphincter . insertion of an artificial urinary sphincter . Injectable bulking agents can be used to treat male stress incontinence . Artificial urinary sphincter . When the sphincter is activated, the patient has to learn to use the sphincter by compressing the pump that causes the cuff to empty . 
As outlined in Chapter 1, the majority of women with ovarian cancer (> 80%) are not diagnosed until the disease has reached an advanced stage . The initial diagnostic pathway of epithelial ovarian cancer is based on the assessment of symptoms and overall clinical picture, biomarkers (particularly CA125), family history and imaging . Although ovarian cancer has previously been considered a 'silent killer', it is now recognized that a high proportion of women have symptoms before diagnosis . The most common symptoms are vague and non-specific, resembling irritable bowel syndrome, and hence a diagnosis of ovarian cancer may be missed (Table 4.1) . In general, further evaluation may be appropriate in a patient with severe or frequent symptoms of recent onset . Symptom indices have been developed in attempts to improve the sensitivity and specification of symptoms for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer . The most common of these is the Goff index, which is considered positive if any of the following symptoms are present more than 12 times a month but have developed within the previous 12 months . The Goff index has a sensitivity of approximately 67% for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and a specificity of approximately 90% . However, the clinical usefulness of such indices depends on how the index is used (higher specificities are achieved when information about symptoms is obtained from clinical notes or questionnaires, rather than by telephone interview), and how index-positive patients are managed . The ongoing ROCkeTS (Refining Ovarian Cancer Test Accuracy Scores) study in the UK aims to validate risk prediction models that estimate the probability of having ovarian cancer for post- and premenopausal women with suspected ovarian cancer, and to define thresholds of predicted risk that inform decisions for patient management . The most established biomarker for ovarian cancer is CA125, the levels of which mainly increase in the later stages of the disease . As a result, CA125 has only limited sensitivity (40-50%) for early-stage ovarian cancer . A more recent tumor marker is the human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4), which is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer . This is used in combination with CA125 and menopausal status in the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA), which predicts the presence of ovarian cancer in patients with a pelvic mass, with a specificity and sensitivity of up to 95% and 76.4%, respectively; specificity is higher in postmenopausal women . Over all ages, ROMA correctly classified 93.8% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer as being at high risk . Prospectively acquired evidence from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) - which applied serial CA125 measurements interpreted via the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) - has shown that screening with this algorithm doubles the number of screen-detected epithelial ovarian cancers, compared with a fixed CA125 cut-off of 35 IU/mL . As a result, defined cut-offs need to be used with caution and always interpreted within the context of the whole clinical picture . A greater focus on interpreting trends in CA125 levels, along with the clinical picture and imaging findings, is likely to define the standard of care in the future . The ability of current imaging techniques to accurately depict lesions in the peritoneum is limited, especially in fine nodular disease . This represents a significant challenge in diagnosing low-volume disease and accurately describing intra-abdominal tumor dissemination patterns . Nevertheless, CT has a well-established role in diagnosing bulky (> 1 cm) lymphadenopathy, distant intraparenchymatous metastatic lesions and additional lesions such as secondary cancers and thromboembolic events that have a significant effect on patient management . Complete surgical staging of ovarian cancer is essential to accurately define the stage of the disease and determine appropriate adjuvant treatment . Up to 30% of patients with apparent early disease will be upstaged after comprehensive staging . The staging system of the International Federation of Gynecological Oncology (FIGO) is shown in Figure 4.2 . Having an accurate FIGO stage will influence the treatment strategies that are most appropriate for the individual patient . The grade of ovarian cancer reflects the degree of distortion from the normal tissue architecture and can correlate with aggressiveness and prognosis . Grade 1: well-differentiated tissue . Grade 2: moderately differentiated tissue . Grade 3: poorly differentiated tissue . Serous tumors are often graded as high or low grade (see Chapter 2) . 
Treatment differences are usually expressed as a hazard ratio (HR) . In order to understand what an HR is, it is necessary to understand what a hazard rate is . The hazard rate for month 1 = 10/1000 . The hazard rate for month 2 = 15/990 . When this is the case it is assigned a single value, the HR . HR = 1: the hazard rate in the active group is identical to that in the control group . HR < 1: the hazard rate in the active group is, on average, lower than that in the control group . The HR for OS in the previous breast cancer example is 0.502 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.390 to 0.755 . HRs are usually given in conjunction with a 95% CI, id est the range of values that is likely to include the true population value (see Chapter 1) . This range can be used to measure the precision of the HR; the narrower the CI the more precise the HR estimate . Logrank test . It takes the whole follow-up period into account . The logrank test implicitly assumes that the HR is fairly constant . Restricted mean survival time . It is a straightforward statistic to calculate as it is the area under the curve (AUC) up to year 10 (Figure 2.5) . Life expectancy difference . Adjusting for baseline imbalances . However, there are numerous baseline variables that may have a bearing on the outcome (exempli gratia patient characteristics such as age, sex and ethnicity, or stage or grade of tumor) . It is therefore usually of value to adjust the analysis to account for any such differences in baseline factors . There are two ways to make such adjustments for time-to-event endpoints . The stratified logrank test can adjust for a small number of factors, while the Cox proportional hazards model is a modeling approach that can, in theory, adjust for many more factors simultaneously . Prognostic and predictive factors . It is becoming fairly standard practice in the oncology setting to use the term prognostic to refer to a baseline factor that affects the endpoint in some way . A prognostic factor can provide information on clinical outcome independent of therapy . In Table 2.1, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is prognostic for death - the greater the ECOG score, the poorer the prognosis . The term predictive is used for a baseline factor that influences the magnitude of difference the treatment makes to the endpoint . In Table 2.2, ECOG performance status is both prognostic and predictive . As in Table 2.1, the higher the ECOG score, the poorer the prognosis . In addition, the lower the ECOG score, the greater the benefit of the treatment over placebo . In this example, visceral metastases is clearly a predictive factor for survival . Time to-event endpoints . Typical examples are . overall survival (OS) . progression-free survival (PFS) . disease-free survival (DFS) . duration of response . Often these endpoints are measured from the time the participants in a study are randomized into treatment groups . This is the case for OS, PFS and DFS, but duration of response is measured from the time point at which partial or complete response is achieved to disease progression . Time-to-event analyses include information from both censored and uncensored observations (see below) . Censoring is a common feature of all time-to-event endpoints . A subject's time to event is said to be censored if the event of interest (death, disease progression etc . has not occurred in that patient by the end of the follow-up period . The OS for such a subject is considered to be at least as long as the duration of the study . At the time of an interim analysis, some subjects may not have been in the study for very long . These subjects will provide censored values if the event of interest has not occurred during the limited follow-up . Kaplan-Meier curves . In this study, the follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 74 months . For the rest of this chapter, for simplicity, let us assume that the event of interest is death . Median overall survival . 
Three-quarters of obese children go on to become obese adults, carrying their risk factors and comorbidities with them as they grow . Postmortem studies on obese children who died from unrelated causes have revealed atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease . Of 86 children fulfilling the criteria there were . There is a strong genetic component, and if both parents are obese the risk is magnified . Sociodemographic factors, including migration, low education and income, and single mothers also confer an increased risk . Lack of physical activity . Children are being conditioned to be inactive from infancy . Children's eating habits reflect those of adults, compounded by the promotion of unhealthy foods to children . Parents of obese or overweight children, who are usually themselves overweight or obese, can best help their children by engaging in a lifestyle modification program aimed at weight loss . Parental denial . Parents are notoriously poor at recognizing obesity in their offspring, and it is becoming increasingly difficult as mean childhood BMI increases, providing fewer 'normal' peers for comparison . Assessment should include . personal and family history of obesity and related conditions . physical activity and eating patterns . Examination should include height, weight and BMI . severe and progressive obesity before 2 years of age . Successful weight management is usually impossible without a stable and motivated family environment . Weight management . However, children over 7 years old with obesity and/or complications may benefit from gradual weight loss of, for example, 0.5 kg per month . smaller portions (children should not be given adult-sized portions) . Physical activity . Increasing sustainable physical activity is crucial in the management of childhood obesity . Any increase in activity will help . Develop an active lifestyle in the whole family . Secondary care may provide further expertise, and more structured and intensive management of overweight/obese children . The elderly . Because of the decrease in skeletal muscle mass and the redistribution of body fat, the use of BMI to assess obesity in the elderly may be misleading . The risks of obesity in old age increase when the fat is predominantly visceral and when sarcopenia is also present; and this group of individuals are most affected by frailty and disability with increasing age . Being overweight or obese in young adulthood and underweight or obese in later life increases the risk of premature death in old age . Obesity-related diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, osteoarthritis and pulmonary disease are increasing in the elderly . Obesity-related disability . A high BMI is a strong predictor of long-term risk for mobility disability in older women, a risk that persists to very old age . The prevalence of type 2 diabetes increases progressively with age . An increase in body fat and abdominal obesity, rather than aging per se, are thought to be directly linked to the greatly increased incidence of type 2 diabetes among the elderly . Obesity defined by BMI or waist circumference is associated with poorer cognition in the elderly . Obesity at midlife is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease later in life, and clustering of vascular risk factors increases the risk in an additive manner . For overweight elderly individuals in good health, there is no good evidence to show that weight loss reduces mortality risk . In the overweight (but not obese) elderly, weight fluctuation in any direction and irrespective of intention, may increase the risk for mobility limitation . It is desirable to prevent weight gain, particularly among the obese, and weight loss, particularly among the non-obese . There are clear benefits in optimizing the intake of vitamin D and calcium in the elderly . Physical activity . Increased physical activity is essential and should be initiated at the outset . Benefits include improved overall well-being and function . Although morbidity and mortality are increased in the elderly, the risk:benefit ratio may be acceptable in those who have severe obesity-related comorbidities and restricted mobility . The major risks of obesity to the pregnant woman and newborn are shown in Table 9.2 . As shown, most of these rise with increasing BMI . However, women with high weight gain during pregnancy have an increased rate of cesarean section in each of the five BMI categories . Restriction of weight gain in pregnancy increases the incidence of preterm birth in women with a normal BMI but not in women with a BMI above 26 kg/m . Physical activity . 
The diagnosis may affect their employment status, whether they decide to have children and where they decide to live . Patients often ask if they could have avoided the disease by changing their behavior in any way . The multidisciplinary team . The medical team is important in coordinating multidisciplinary patient care . General practitioner/family doctor . As care providers over a lifetime, they have a unique insight into the needs of the individual . Good communication within the healthcare support team will ensure a well-integrated approach to the management of MS and its resulting morbidity . Advanced practice clinician . They can provide prompt clinical assessment and, where necessary, review . The MS specialist APC is well placed to explain the practical aspects associated with all DMTs . Traditionally, training in the use of injectable therapies has been a principal role for the MS nurse . They can be called upon if adverse effects occur, or if patients are having difficulty adhering to a particular therapy . Speech and language therapist . The 'SALT' team are highly skilled in the assessment of speech and swallowing . They can aid communication in patients who have severe dysarthria, and also delineate the nature of swallowing problems in MS . They can recommend dietary changes and actions to maximize swallowing and to minimize the risk of aspiration . They are able to identify when swallowing has deteriorated to high risk levels, and can recommend when institutional enteral feeding should be considered . Occupational therapist . The occupational therapist works with the patient to allow them to remain independent for as long as possible . They will assess functional ability and evaluate how activities of daily living are carried out . They can then recommend training or equipment to make life easier, and potentially allow the person to return home or to the working environment . Occupational therapists can install handrails in the home, and can plan conversion of bathrooms to 'wet' rooms to minimize the risk of falls . The nutritionist can help plan a diet that is high in fiber to improve bowel function in patients with constipation . Nutritionists also plan diets designed to maintain health, particularly in patients who require an exclusion diet for other reasons (exempli gratia gluten intolerance) . In advanced MS, which is typically associated with weight loss and swallowing difficulties, they may design a diet that is tailored to the needs of the individual . Nutritionists also manage enteral feeding if a gastrostomy becomes necessary . Social worker . Patients may not always be aware of their entitlement, and for various reasons may struggle with completing forms . Rehousing to incorporate the needs of the patient and their family requires vital input from social workers . They are also able to monitor for any signs of abuse in the vulnerable, and act to protect those in need of help . Other valuable members of the team . MS affects people mainly between the ages of 20 and 40 years, generally the most productive time of their lives, especially with regards to children and career . Some people are diagnosed early in their career, and it is important that they are not discriminated against on the basis of the diagnosis . In early stages of the disease, disability may not be visible but symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive dysfunction can be disabling . Consequently, concerns regarding employment can become a great source of stress . Maintaining a place in education and the workforce has numerous financial, physical and psychological benefits . Employers have an obligation to aid employees as much as possible to remain in employment . If 'reasonable adjustments' can be made to the workplace setting to enable the employee to continue working, in many countries the employer is required by law to make these . The nature of these adjustments will depend on the individual circumstances and what is considered 'reasonable' by both the employee and the employer . Such adjustments could include . allowing the employee to work from home . providing longer break periods . providing ramps and wheelchair access . transferring the employee to a role with fewer physical demands . The provision of legislation designed to protect people with MS from discrimination, based on their disability, varies from country to country (see Useful resources) . The primary carers in some countries may also be covered . In Australia, the relevant authority in each state must be informed . In the USA, people with MS may need to be assessed by a member of the Association for Driver Rehabilitation Specialists . 
Psychotic symptoms are the result of particular interactions between medications and PD pathology . Medications used to treat the motor symptoms of PD, with the exception of the anticholinergic drugs, rarely cause psychosis when used in patients without PD . Furthermore, untreated PD patients only rarely develop psychotic symptoms . To date, almost all physiological studies of PDP have evaluated patients with visual hallucinations only, not other hallucinations or delusions, and it has yet to be elucidated whether particular brain structures or neurotransmitter alterations are involved . While almost all patients with PDP are on 'standard' medications for the treatment of motor symptoms, many are also on other psychoactive medications . The association between psychotic symptoms and dopamine stimulation, either via dopamine itself or dopamine agonists, is clear, but there is no general dose-response relationship . Hallucinations are not generally associated with ON responses to medications, when brain levels of dopamine are likely to be at their peak, or with the occurrence of dyskinesias, which are usually an indication of high serum levels of dopamine . Indeed, many patients report that the hallucinations only occur at night, on awakening or during the evening, when dopamine levels are likely to be lower, and less commonly during the day . Some patients do, however, report an association with high dopamine levels . In an experiment to determine a dose-response relationship between serum levodopa levels and hallucinations, patients who reported daily hallucinations in the evenings were brought to the hospital and given intravenous infusions of levodopa that produced higher serum levels of the drug than they received at home . None hallucinated in the hospital, indicating the complex nature of hallucinations . Problems with this theory include the, admittedly rare, reports of PDP in untreated patients and hallucinations in untreated patients with DLB, which many believe is simply a variant of PD and is often confused with it . In one study, 42% of patients with newly diagnosed PD who had never received any PD medications reported having had very minor and very transient psychotic symptoms months before the diagnosis; only 5% of an untreated age-matched control group without PD reported these . The involvement of serotonin in PDP also has some physiological support . An increase in 5HT2A receptors was also found in the temporal cortex of patients with PD who had visual hallucinations . Furthermore, the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) has been shown to be associated with delusions in patients with DLB . Patients with PD and DLB have a greater cholinergic deficit than those with Alzheimer's disease . Anticholinergic drugs induce PDP . There is an association between dementia and PDP . Yet, patients with Alzheimer's disease are significantly less likely to develop hallucinations or psychosis than patients taking PD medications . A greater number of Lewy bodies have been found in the amygdala and parahippocampus of patients with PD who had visual hallucinations, but not in those who did not hallucinate . Neurochemical studies have demonstrated an association between hallucinations and reduced overall cholinergic function (as indicated by choline acetyltransferase) in the frontal and temporal cortex of patients with DLB . An association has also been reported between delusions and the upregulation of presynaptic muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors . One study found no cortical volume differences between hallucinators and non-hallucinators, whereas others have found limbic and mesolimbic volume reductions, as well as atrophy in other regions . Connectivity studies comparing hallucinators and non-hallucinators have reported decreased and increased connectivity between areas of the brain involved in attention and visual processing . In a particularly creative study that used connectivity as a measure, the 'strength' of mental imagery was compared between normal controls and patients with PD with and without visual hallucinations . The hallucinators had the stronger responses . Genetic influences are likely, with some genetically determined forms of PD being both more and less associated with PDP (see Chapter 3) . The occurrence of hallucinations is largely dependent on the state of alertness . Visual processing abnormalities . The association between visual impairment and visual hallucinations underscores the importance of environment in the development of hallucinations . The phenomenology of visual hallucinations also indicates the variable nature of the underlying pathophysiology, as some patients only see their hallucinations in the dark and report that they resolve if they shine a light on them, whereas other patients report seeing the hallucinations only in the light . Functional MRI studies have demonstrated different responses to flashing lights or facial images in hallucinators compared to the responses of non-hallucinators, but numbers have been small and confirmatory studies are lacking . 
Early motor and non-motor indicators . Signs may be subtle in the early stages of the disease . In suspected cases it is often helpful to ask patients what tasks they find difficult . Motor indicators . Dressing or other activities requiring fine finger movements may become awkward and take longer than usual . Swinging of arms, an automatic movement, may become impaired on the side affected by Parkinson's disease . Walking in crowds may be difficult, because the person cannot make the rapid adjustments necessary to avoid bumping into other people . Speech may be soft and low in volume, with frequent pauses . Non-motor indicators . There may be a very early loss or impaired sense of smell . Specific sleep disorders such as rapid eye movement (REM) behavior disorder (RBD) may develop . Major depression, cognitive dysfunction, falls and/or constipation may accompany RBD or hyposmia . Specific color blindness and contrast sensitivity may develop . Symptoms and signs . Parkinsonian tremor is worse at rest (4-7 Hz) and is often unilateral . Some have emergent tremor, id est tremor that appears after an initial delay . Parkinsonian versus essential tremor . However, the tremor itself may only partially respond to dopaminergic therapy . Dystonic tremor . The natural history of this condition remains unclear . Bradykinesia/akinesia is difficulty in initiating, and slowness in executing, movement . One or both arms may stop swinging when walking . Later, gait is affected, with difficulty starting off walking, small steps and shuffling . Carers may nudge patients to start them moving again . Speech may assume a quiet monotonous character . These will improve objective measurement of motor symptoms . Rigidity is defined as increased resistance to passive movement; it is therefore a clinical sign detected by physicians . 'lead-pipe' rigidity - a constant resistance to passive movement . Postural problems . In some, this may become dominant (camptocormia) . Flexion is encountered particularly in the neck and trunk, and also when the arms are brought forward in front of the body . Postural imbalance can be detected by the 'pull' test . The doctor stands behind the patient and applies a quick pull backwards to the front of the shoulders . Falls are common in late Parkinson's disease and are a major cause of morbidity . Figure 3.6 outlines a plan for routine use of the NMSQuest in clinical practice . New diagnostic criteria . Confirmation of diagnosis . Dopaminergic challenge tests (see below) are not routinely recommended for diagnostic purposes . Dopaminergic challenge . The authors stress the importance of the points shown in bold . Imaging tests . This last condition causes lower-body parkinsonism, cognitive decline and early bladder symptoms . DWI is also thought to differentiate between MSA and PSP . Further studies using this potentially widely available technique are under way . Transcranial ultrasound scanning . In a study by Berg et al . To address concerns about the subjective nature of the test and investigator bias, Prestel et al . This left the diagnosis to be made solely on the basis of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity . In a longitudinal study by Berg et al . However, the technique is still not widely used, possibly because it requires considerable local expertise and training . Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with DaTSCAN . This type of imaging also appears to correlate with the progression of Parkinson's disease . Other tests . PET, while more sensitive than SPECT, is only available in research-based studies and is not routinely indicated in clinical practice . Further long-term studies addressing the natural history of SWEDD cases are required . genetic tests for Huntington's disease . syphilis serology . measurement of manganese levels if MRI shows increased signal in the pallidum on T1-weighted images . genetic testing in relevant cases . Referral and 'shared care' . Initiation of treatment in primary care is discouraged . Differential diagnoses . Shared care . 
The features usually described are those of severe emphysema . Recent improvements in imaging techniques, particularly the advent of CT and, more recently, high-resolution CT (HRCT), have provided more sensitive means of diagnosing emphysema in life . The most reliable radiographic signs of emphysema can be classified by their causes of overinflation, vascular changes and bullae . Overinflation of the lungs results in the following radiographic features . Vascular changes associated with emphysema result from loss of alveolar walls and are shown on the plain chest radiograph by . a reduction in the size and number of pulmonary vessels, particularly at the periphery of the lung . areas of transradiancy . Assessment of the vascular loss in emphysema clearly depends on the quality of the radiograph . Although these measurements can be used to detect the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension, they cannot accurately predict the level of the pulmonary artery pressure and they are not felt to be particularly sensitive . CT scanning has been used to detect and quantify emphysema . Techniques can be divided into those that use visual assessment of low-density areas on the CT scan, which can be either semiquantitative or quantitative, and those that use CT lung density to quantify areas of low X-ray attenuation . These two techniques are usually employed to measure macroscopic or microscopic emphysema, respectively . Visual assessment of emphysema on CT scanning (Figure 5.2) reveals . areas of low attenuation without obvious margins or walls . attenuation and pruning of the vascular tree . abnormal vascular configurations . The sign that correlates best with areas of macroscopic emphysema is an area of low attenuation . It is possible to distinguish the various types of emphysema using HRCT, particularly when the changes are not severe . It is generally acceptable to select patients with upper lung zone emphysema for volume reduction surgery by visual inspection of an HRCT by an experienced radiologist and surgeon . If CT scanning is to be used to measure microscopic emphysema, care should be taken to standardize the scanning conditions, particularly the lung volume, and to calibrate the CT scanner, since these factors affect CT lung density . Patient factors (exempli gratia obesity) can also affect quantification of emphysema on CT; in such cases, patients can be asked to inhale to a certain lung volume using respiratory-gated CT . These techniques have not, as yet, been sufficiently standardized for use in clinical practice, but density measurements have been shown to correlate with morphometric measurements of distal airspace size in resected lungs . Assessment of CT lung density is currently being used in clinical trials to demonstrate progressive emphysema . Detection of bullae . Whether a bulla is detected on a chest radiograph depends on its size and the degree to which it is obscured by overlying lung . CT scanning is much more sensitive than plain chest radiography in detecting bullae and can be used to determine their number, size and position . Other features can be assessed on the CT scan including bone density, coronary artery calcification and pulmonary artery size . Echocardiography has been used to assess the right ventricle and to detect pulmonary hypertension in COPD . Nevertheless, an adequate examination can be achieved in 65-85% of patients with COPD . Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography has been used to assess the ejection flow dynamics of the right ventricle in patients with pulmonary hypertension . Although the pulsed-wave Doppler technique is useful in differentiating patients with an elevated pulmonary arterial pressure from those with normal pulmonary arterial pressure, it is not as accurate as the continuous-wave Doppler technique in assessing pulmonary arterial pressure . Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is the best technique for non-invasive evaluation of pulmonary arterial pressure; the tricuspid gradient assessed in this way can be used to calculate the right ventricular systolic pressure . where P RV and P RA are the right ventricular and right atrial pressures and v is the maximum velocity . The right atrial pressure is estimated from clinical examination of the jugular venous pressure . There is still debate as to whether this technique is sufficiently sensitive and reproducible to monitor longitudinal changes in pulmonary arterial pressure and the effects of therapeutic interventions, particularly in patients with COPD . 
Treatment of people with type 2 diabetes requires consideration of several aspects of the patient's health, and the range of areas is summarized in Table 7.1 . Ideally, an individualized approach that considers the patient holistically is encouraged, with the patient becoming skilled in self-management of most aspects of their diabetes care . Each patient will have varying levels of diabetic complications, cardiovascular risk, risk from hypoglycemia and so on, and thus diabetes care should be tailored to individual needs . At diagnosis, the patient should be given simple and clear messages about diabetes and how it may affect health with regard to complications and cardiovascular risk . Importantly, patients should be encouraged that, with excellent glucose, lipid and blood pressure control and smoking cessation, risks of complications and cardiovascular events can be reduced substantially . Printed educational resources are often available from national diabetes patient advocacy and support bodies . Patients should be taught how to measure capillary blood glucose so they can monitor their control and detect and treat hyperglycemia . Care following minor trauma should be discussed . Studies show type 2 diabetes is often present for 5 years prior to diagnosis . Dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the cornerstones of management in the patient with diabetes and are discussed in detail in chapter 8 . Glycemic targets . Drug therapy . If glucose monitoring or HbA 1c levels indicate suboptimal control, drug therapy needs to be considered . Drugs currently available to treat type 2 diabetes are listed in Table 7.3 . Metformin is a biguanide drug that is usually considered as a first-line agent in type 2 diabetes mellitus . Metformin may also reduce appetite in some patients, which helps with weight reduction; this action is being studied . For patients experiencing adverse effects, the dose should be halved and lowered further if symptoms do not resolve . Metformin doses should be lowered in renal disease . Specialist societies and diabetes associations around the world now recognize the importance of tailoring diabetes medications to the needs of the patient and the characteristics of their obesity . These are useful in reducing the pill burden when patients are receiving multiple medications for other medical conditions . Patients receiving sulfonylureas require education about hypoglycemia, which can be severe in some people . Patients need to be warned not to skip meals if they have taken their sulfonylurea . A further side effect of sulfonylurea therapy is weight gain . There is also an increased risk of fracture . These drugs are associated with modest weight loss . Insulin therapy (see Chapter 6) is frequently required in type 2 diabetes mellitus . The defect in type 2 diabetes is insufficient insulin production to meet demand . Studies indicate there is gradual decline of insulin production with time . In type 2 diabetes, insulin can be given as a long-acting single dose before bedtime . Other drugs such as metformin and sulfonylureas are continued . Other dosing regimens include twice daily premixed insulin for older patients or a basal-bolus regimen for patients who can manage a more complex insulin dosing regimen . Patient monitoring will indicate the success of insulin addition . In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, consideration should be given to obesity-management strategies, including bariatric surgery (see chapter 8) . Other management targets . Smoking cessation is critical in reducing macrovascular disease in patients with diabetes . Patients who smoke should be supported with psychological strategies and, where appropriate, drug therapy to stop smoking . Blood pressure should ideally be normalized in patients with diabetes . Weight reduction and increased physical activity may have some benefit; multiple drugs are often necessary . Lipid-lowering therapy . Risk reduction includes lifestyle management (including diet, weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation and blood pressure control) . Lipid-lowering therapy is often indicated, although guidelines vary in different countries . Fibrate therapy is indicated in those patients with predominant hypertriglyceridemia for whom lifestyle modification has not normalized triglyceride levels . Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) at a low dose should be considered in all patients with type 2 diabetes for its cardioprotective effects . Inflexibility also leads to rebellious behaviors by patients, often to their metabolic detriment . These programs can help patients and their clinicians examine patterns in blood glucose levels . 
Persistent postsurgical pain . A major review of this subject by Kehlet et al . was published in 2006 . The factors in Table 8.2 are associated with increased risk of PPSP, but no comprehensive study has been carried out to evaluate their relative importance . Although evidence of genetic factors is not available for PPSP, Tegeder et al . (2006) have identified a genetic influence on the development of chronic pain following an acute episode of sciatica . There is also evidence that intra- and postoperative use of epidural or regional neural blockade may be helpful . The introduction of video-assisted thoracic surgery made no difference to the incidence of post-thoracotomy PPSP at 1 year after surgery . Initially, a reasonable attempt should be made to rule out such diagnoses . However, in the majority of cases no remediable surgical complication will be found . Patient education . Pharmacotherapy alone will rarely be sufficient . A biopsychosocial assessment should be made and treatment plans should aim to rectify maladaptive changes in physical, psychological and environmental domains . Thus, patients often feel angry and let down and find it difficult to move on unless the anger is addressed with careful explanation and reassurance . Patients may have been stigmatized at work because of a perceived unnecessarily long recovery, requiring input to the workplace . Pharmacotherapy relies on tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), anticonvulsants and sometimes membrane stabilizers . In severe cases a trial of subcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) may be necessary . PNS is emerging as a valuable option for postinguinal hernia repair PPSP . Postincisional pain . Postincisional syndrome is defined as pain at or close to the site of a surgical incision that persists beyond the usual healing period . Postamputation persistent pain . It is interesting, then, that only 30-50% develop PPSP, whereas 100% have nerve injury (see Table 8.1) . This emphasizes the multifactorial basis of PPSP . Use of a ligature tie in animal studies is known to generate neuropathic pain . The clinical context of amputation may play a role . The neuromas that form at the end of cut nerves after amputation are hypersensitive and have abnormally dense sodium (and other ion) channels that generate ectopic discharges . This abnormal activity initiates and maintains the central sensitization associated with nerve injury (see Chapter 1) . There may also be a change in the distribution of sodium channel subtypes, with an upregulation of Na V 1.8 . This opens up a possible new selective target, as Na V 1.8 occurs only on small primary afferent fibers . These changes contribute to the persistent pain experienced after amputation . Phantom experiences, phantom pain and stump pain are different entities that share the same pathophysiological mechanisms . Up to 96% of amputees report phantom experiences, and 49% complain of stump pain . Depending on the tissue amputated, phantom pain may have an early prevalence in excess of 50% . Phantom pain affects not only limbs; phantom bladder, rectal, penile, breast and vaginal pain after surgery are all well described . While phantom sensations may be described as tingling or itchy, phantom pain consists primarily of burning, cramping and shooting pains . Sometimes phantom pain in the missing body part is similar to the pain present before the amputation . To date, attempts to prevent the development of phantom pain using peridural anesthesia or regional blocks have not proven successful . However, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that have evaluated these preventive regimens have not uniformly suppressed afferent input from the involved site . Therefore, the results of the studies should be interpreted as inconclusive rather than negative . Ketamine, a non-competitive N -methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been used in humans to treat various neuropathic pain syndromes . Intravenous ketamine provides relief from phantom and stump pain, but one small crossover RCT indicated a high incidence of side effects . Small randomized studies have suggested that morphine decreases pain intensity, albeit during short-term observation periods . Antidepressants and anticonvulsants . 
Although these operations were successful at controlling tremor, inevitably they led to paralysis of the affected side and were therefore abandoned . The operation was abandoned but the patient improved substantially . More recently, deep brain stimulation using depth electrodes has been introduced . Which patients require surgery? . Surgery is usually employed in patients when manipulations of drug therapy have failed to control 'off' symptoms, tremor, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias . However, in carefully selected patients surgery leads to control of 'off' symptoms, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias . For these patients, the operation of choice is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamus to enable a reduction in dopaminergic therapy and control of dyskinesias . Patients with severe resistant unilateral tremor may undergo single-side thalamic stimulation . Bilateral pallidal stimulation may be a treatment option for those with severe resistant dyskinesias but with limitations concerning age and neuropsychiatric risk profile for subthalamic stimulation . It is not yet possible to say with certainty which patients benefit most from surgery and which operations should be performed . Ideally, surgical centers should take part in collaborative trials to evaluate the potential of lesional surgery and compare this older technique with deep brain stimulation . Lesional surgery . Lesional surgery may be preferred to deep brain stimulation when a simpler procedure without complex follow-up is required, especially when it is suspected that a patient will not attend the necessary follow-up after insertion of a stimulator, or if patients have to travel long distances . Lesional surgery is performed by stereotaxy (Figure 5.1) . The patient is therefore woken at the time of lesional placement for physiological stimulation and microelectrode recording . If a second operation is needed on the other side, it should be performed at a later time, and deep brain stimulation should be used in order to avoid permanent side effects . Thalamotomy, surgery on the VIM nucleus of the thalamus, is the most effective way of controlling tremor . It can be used when tremor is the major disabling feature of Parkinson's disease, and also for essential or ataxic (Holmes') tremor . Deep brain stimulation is the best method of delivery, particularly if a bilateral operation is required . Lesional surgery of the STN can improve tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity . Deep brain stimulation . The hypothesis that deep brain stimulation (Table 5.3) could inhibit tremor and dyskinesias was proposed when it was found that electrical impulses applied during preoperative testing had this effect . The technology was already available from pain pathway stimulation . Deep brain stimulation can be used to create electrical depolarization of neurons in any basal ganglia site . Initially, wires emerging from the skull are attached to an external stimulator (Figure 5.2) . Non-rechargeable batteries can last up to 5 years and may be conserved by turning stimulation off at night; the patient can do this using a magnet . Patients undergoing deep brain stimulation need to be followed up by a team able to monitor and adjust its effects . Tremor will cease within seconds of starting stimulation and reappears quickly on stopping . VIM deep brain stimulation appears not to be affected by age . The frequency of distal appendicular tremor and greater tremor indicates good control of tremor by VIM deep brain stimulation . Deep brain stimulation can reverse akinesia, rigidity and tremor but not many axial symptoms . Stimulation of the globus pallidus does not control tremor but has a good effect on akinesia, rigidity and dyskinesia, with a smaller risk of neuropsychiatric side effects than STN stimulation . Most studies have excluded patients over the age of 75 years . The researchers concluded that non-motor symptoms should be considered when choosing the target for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease; up to now, deep brain stimulation has primarily focused on motor symptoms . Effect on non-motor symptoms . A further study by Schupbach and colleagues examined the effect of deep brain stimulation on mortality in Parkinson's disease, by examining the records of 171 consecutive cases treated by deep brain stimulation of the STN . Nerve-cell transplantation . Over 500 patients worldwide have now received nerve-cell transplants into the brain . Retinal cell transplantation . 
Fibrinolysis entails activation of fibrin-bound plasminogen, resulting in clot lysis . Lysis is modulated by inhibitors of fibrinolysis, which are activated by thrombin or released by platelets . In reality, these processes tend to merge, with the activated platelet and endothelial cell membranes providing the foundation on which the clotting factors can become activated, and fibrin formed and lysed . Endothelial cells . The VWF tethers platelets to the endothelium, and glycoprotein VI binds platelets to subendothelial collagen . Platelet activation exposes the fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein alphaIIbbeta3, and there are also receptors for thrombin and thromboxane . Binding of these ligands to their receptors induces platelet activation and aggregation . Coagulation system . The coagulation factors are a series of plasma proteins synthesized by the liver that, when activated, generate thrombin and convert fibrinogen to fibrin via a sequence of complex reactions . At the site of injury, TF forms a complex with factor (F)VII (TF-FVIIa) on the surface of activated platelets . The TF-FVIIa complex activates FIX and FX, and the activated FX cleaves prothrombin to form small amounts of thrombin . Thrombin is a potent activator of platelets, which provide an enhanced catalytic surface on which further coagulation is promoted . The activated platelets release hemostatic factors (exempli gratia fibrinogen and VWF) and polyphosphate, which accelerate the activation of FXI by thrombin . Polyphosphate is also capable of activating FV, further enhancing thrombin formation . This occurs when protein C is activated and, together with protein S, inhibits activated FV and FVIII, as described below . Inhibitors of coagulation . The plasma contains a series of proteins that inhibit activated procoagulant enzymes and prevent excessive intravascular coagulation . Tissue factor pathway inhibitor binds FXa, forming a complex that rapidly inhibits the TF-FVIIa complex . Antithrombin is a potent and clinically very important inhibitor of thrombin, FXa, FXIa and the TF-FVIIa complex . The protein C pathway is a further mechanism by which intravascular coagulation is limited (Figure 1.4) . This pathway is initiated by thrombin when it binds to thrombomodulin on the endothelial surface and activates protein C bound to its receptor on the cell membrane . Activated protein C - along with its cofactor, free protein S - inactivates the activated coagulation factors Va and VIIIa by proteolysis . Protein Z binds to the Z-protease inhibitor and the complex inactivates FXa . This pathway consists of an initiator, tPA, which is synthesized and released from endothelial cells . Inhibitors of fibrinolysis . Fibrinolysis is inhibited by the following factors . Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and antiplasmin inhibit tPA and plasmin, respectively . Thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor is a carboxypeptidase that is activated by thrombin and cleaves lysine from fibrin, preventing plasminogen binding to fibrin . Defective thrombin generation, as in the various forms of hemophilia, impairs activation of this inhibitor, resulting in enhanced fibrinolysis and bleeding . Sequential steps activate specific procoagulants (identified by Roman numerals; a=activated), eventually culminating in thrombin generation and fibrin formation . However, as previously described, each step is regulated by clotting inhibitors . TF-FVIIa complex is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor . FIXa and FXa are inhibited by antithrombin . FVa and FVIIIa are inhibited by activated protein C and protein S . Thrombin is inhibited by thrombomodulin and antithrombin . For example, hemorrhages occur in hemophilia (deficiency of either FVIII or FIX) because tissue factor pathway inhibitor inhibits the alternative pathway for thrombin generation via the TF-FVIIa complex (see Chapter 6) . 
All doctors treating women with epilepsy should consider the following areas . The risk of breakthrough pregnancy is not insignificant . Up to 20% of women with epilepsy have abnormal ovarian function, including anovulatory menstrual cycles and polycystic ovaries . These problems may be more common in patients treated with sodium valproate (VPA) . Some women find that their seizures worsen mid-cycle or around menstruation, a phenomenon known as catamenial epilepsy . The fertility of women with treated epilepsy is one-quarter to one-third lower than that of the general population . However, when women do conceive, most can expect to undergo uneventful pregnancies and deliver healthy babies . Women whose epilepsy is well controlled usually remain seizure free during pregnancy and delivery . Conversely, those who continue to report seizures before conception may have increased seizures during pregnancy . Although it would be ideal to withdraw AED treatment in women contemplating pregnancy, for many this would result in recurrence or exacerbation of seizures that could be dangerous for both mother and fetus . These and other guidelines for managing epilepsy in women who are contemplating pregnancy are set out in Table 8.2 . The incidence of minor and major fetal malformations increases in women with epilepsy, even if they are untreated . Commonly quoted figures are 3-6% for women with epilepsy compared with 2-3% in the general population . The risk increases disproportionately with the number of AEDs taken, being approximately 3% for one drug (similar to background risk), 5% for two, 10% for three and over 20% in women taking more than three AEDs (Figure 8.2) . There are still insufficient data regarding the safety of other modern AEDs . The risk of intracerebral hemorrhage increases if the birth is traumatic . Women with epilepsy who become pregnant should call the toll-free number (1 888 233 2334) to enroll . Physicians cannot enroll patients; the woman herself must call as part of the informed consent process . This registry requires input from the attending clinician and not the patient . All physicians who care for women taking AEDs during pregnancy are invited to contribute . There is also an active prospective pregnancy register in the UK . Elderly patients . Old age is now the most common time in life to develop epilepsy . The number of elderly people diagnosed with epilepsy is set to rise further with the aging of the population . Nearly all de-novo seizures in elderly people are partial-onset with or without secondary generalization . Underlying factors can be identified in a greater proportion of elderly patients than younger patients, and include cerebrovascular disease, dementia and tumor . Diagnosis of epilepsy can be challenging and may depend on a witnessed event . Complex partial seizures presenting as confusion may be misdiagnosed as psychiatric symptoms . Postictal confusion can be prolonged in the elderly and may contribute to physical injury sustained during a seizure . AEDs are the mainstay of treatment, and are effective in most patients . Complete seizure control can be expected in more than 70% of elderly patients . Low doses are generally recommended in the elderly in order to minimize adverse effects . The patient, and often the spouse and children, must be convinced of the need for lifelong treatment . Sympathetic explanation and assured support will help an elderly person regain their self-confidence after epilepsy has been diagnosed and AED treatment established . In patients with multiple concomitant medications, AEDs that do not produce pharmacokinetic interactions are the preferred choice (see Table 4.6) . Few clinical trials of AEDs have been performed specifically in the elderly . Children who develop epilepsy should be re-evaluated during their teenage years, and AED levels should be monitored . AED doses may, therefore, need to be reduced as a child grows older . Falling AED levels may indicate imperfect compliance, a common occurrence in this age group . Patients with learning disabilities . Tonic-clonic seizures are common, but many patients also have partial and other generalized seizure types . Co-prescription of antipsychotic drugs may further reduce the seizure threshold . The home assessment should include . previous and current AED treatment . circulating AED levels if appropriate . Home video recordings can help to confirm or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy . Numbers and doses of AEDs should be minimized as much as possible . 
In over 100 studies published in the second half of the 20th century, fewer than one half of anorexic patients recovered on average, whereas one-third improved, and 20% remained chronically ill . In seven studies published since 2004, most patients with anorexia ascertained through outpatient settings had achieved remission by 5-year follow-up, but inpatient samples had lower remission rates . In these most recent studies, rates of continued anorexia at follow-up ranged from 2% in a 9-year follow-up of patients at a community clinic, to 18% at 12 years for individuals from an inpatient center; other participants who did not achieve remission over the course of follow-up had moved to a diagnosis of either bulimia or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) . One consistent finding across long-term studies has been that a large proportion of anorexic patients followed over time suffered from additional psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, affective disorders, substance-use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline or histrionic personality disorders; schizophrenia is only rarely observed at follow-up . There seems to be a critical threshold of duration of illness (of about 12 years) after which it is increasingly unlikely that patients will recover, regardless of the interventions used . More than one-third of patients have recurrent affective illnesses . Variables affecting outcome . In long-term outcome studies of anorexia nervosa, the findings regarding prognostic factors have also been very heterogeneous . Most studies indicated that a short duration of symptoms before treatment resulted in a favorable outcome, but findings are ambiguous regarding age at onset of illness . In contrast, a good parent-child relationship may protect the patient from a poor outcome . In addition, the data clearly show that chronicity leads to negative outcome, a finding that implies that there are cases of anorexia refractory to treatment . A cross-cultural study revealed that the outcome of an adolescent eating disorder is relatively similar across cultures, and that a later onset leads to a better prognosis . No definite conclusion can be drawn from the outcome studies as to the relevance of socioeconomic status . Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychological disorder . In a prospective 21-year follow-up study, 16% of 84 patients with anorexia had died from the disorder and its complications . Across studies published since 2004, the crude mortality rates have ranged from 0 to 8%, with a cumulative rate of 2.8% . These rates are lower than those previously reported, which may reflect improvement in medical stabilization of the patients and/or study recruitment from sources with less severely ill cases . If identified at this early stage, patients typically seek treatment and appear to be motivated to overcome the problem . Without treatment most patients experience a chronic fluctuation of binge/purge behavior . Although individuals with bulimia experience variations in their weight, they rarely approach the low weight ranges associated with anorexia . Recent data are available on the longitudinal course of bulimia from a total of 79 study series covering over 5000 patients followed between 6 months and 12 years . On average, close to 45% of the patients showed full recovery from bulimia, whereas 27% improved considerably, and nearly 23% had a chronic protracted course . Crossover to another eating disorder (most often EDNOS, more rarely anorexia) at the follow-up evaluation amounted to a mean of 22.5% . The data suggest a curvilinear course, with highest recovery rates between 4 and 9 years of follow-up, and reverse peaks for both improvement and chronicity before 4 years and after 10 years of follow-up . As stated above, the course and outcome for women with bulimia is generally more favorable than for those with anorexia . A study in the UK found that bulimia and binge-eating disorder among young women had different courses and outcomes . While the prognosis of those with bulimia was relatively poor, the majority of those with binge-eating disorder recovered during a 5-year follow-up period . Across outcome studies of bulimia, crude mortality rates have ranged from 0 to 2%, with a cumulative mortality rate of 0.4% . Adjusting for duration of follow-up, death appeared to be five times less likely to occur in bulimia than in anorexia across the studies reviewed . Course and prognosis . 
Treatment decisions depend on many factors but the risk category is at the core . It may be possible to build a prognostic picture using genetic markers of cell cycle progression . Promising results with the Prolaris genomic test (see page 54) suggest that it may add prognostic value to current methods . Other gene-based tests such as Oncotype DX and Decipher (see page 54) also offer considerable potential . Active surveillance . Active surveillance involves PSA measurement and a digital rectal exam (DRE) every 3-6 months . MRI and repeat biopsies are usually organized 6-12 months after diagnosis or if cancer progression is suspected . Curative-intent therapy is initiated if the cancer shows signs of progression and before it becomes incurable . Radical prostatectomy . The procedure used to be commonly performed via the retropubic route but it is now increasingly performed laparoscopically with robotic assistance . A perineal approach is also possible but this has fallen out of favor . Long-term studies have shown normal life expectancy in patients with complete excision of specimen-confined disease . Moreover, erectile dysfunction after surgery can now be treated quite effectively (see Chapter 9) . Table 5.5 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of radical prostatectomy . The difference was greatest in men under 65 years of age . A multimodal approach that includes adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered . However, advantages in terms of cancer recurrence or survival have not been demonstrated so this practice remains investigational . Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (Figure 5.2) has become the technique of choice in most centers . The operating time is somewhat longer, but blood loss and length of hospital stay are significantly reduced, and recovery is quicker; patients also return to work sooner . Open prostatectomy was associated with higher rates of complications and transfusion . The eligibility criteria for radiotherapy are shown in Table 5.6 . The principal side effects with EBRT are due to radiation damage to the bladder, urethra and rectum . Rectal side effects consist of urgency, frequency, tenesmus and bleeding . In the longer term there is an increased risk of rectal and bladder cancers . Similar improvements have been noted in other North American trials . It can correct for prostate movement, which helps to reduce irradiation of surrounding tissue . Patients tend to appreciate the short duration of treatment (usually only a week) . However, longer-term follow-up data are required before CyberKnife becomes an established treatment . Patient selection criteria are given in Table 5.7 . Watchful waiting . These men are counseled and reviewed regularly with clinical examination and PSA measurements . If disease progression is identified, palliative androgen deprivation is initiated and continued until death, rather than instigating curative therapy . Experimental techniques . A probe delivers HIFU transrectally to the prostate and achieves focal tissue destruction . The reliability and durability of this treatment is still uncertain . The urethra is protected by circulating warm water (44°C) through a catheter . MRI-ultrasound fusion-targeted cryotherapy . Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy of this approach using post-cryotherapy biopsy . Early results are encouraging but this technique is not yet used in the clinic . Further trials are needed to confirm these findings, and it may therefore be several years until this technique becomes widely available . Antiandrogen monotherapy . Hormonal therapy is discussed in full in Chapter 7 . A survival benefit of 35% was also observed in men receiving radiation with adjuvant bicalutamide . Use of an antiandrogen has the advantage of potentially preserving libido and sexual function (Figure 5.5) . If progression occurs, treatment with an LHRH analog may prove beneficial . Management of local complications . Locally advanced prostate cancer may cause any of several urologic emergencies . Acute or chronic urinary retention may require TURP . Care should be taken with this procedure not to induce stress or complete urinary incontinence, because the normal landmarks can be distorted by the tumor . Pelvic lymphadenopathy can also cause unilateral or bilateral leg swelling due to compression of the iliac veins, occasionally requiring venous stenting . 
Radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy . Radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is indicated for the treatment of . disease that is unresponsive to treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) . The surgery is associated with a very low rate of local pelvic recurrence in patients without lymph node metastasis . Removal of these lymph nodes is crucial for accurate staging and provides potentially curative treatment in patients with N1 or N2 disease . Almost two-thirds of patients will experience at least one complication following radical cystectomy, and up to one-quarter will require re-admission after discharge . Morbidity may significantly limit use of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery . ERAS protocols have demonstrated benefits in the post-operative management of patients undergoing radical cystectomy, with quicker return of bowel function and shorter length of hospital stay . Minimally invasive surgery . Peri-operative treatment for intermediate- or high-risk bladder cancer . Additional treatment approaches should be considered for the management of organ-confined cancer that is at high risk of local or distant recurrence . Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy are collectively referred to as perioperative systemic therapies . Adjuvant therapy refers to additional treatment given after definitive primary treatment, with the intention of destroying microscopic residual cancer cells in order to reduce the risk of local or distant relapse . Most patients who receive adjuvant therapy will not benefit from it: either the cancer has already been cured by primary therapy or micrometastatic disease exists that is already resistant to the planned adjuvant therapy . However, adjuvant therapy is curative in a subgroup of patients . Until these patients can be identified reliably, all eligible patients are treated and may experience the resultant side effects of treatment, even though only a minority will benefit . Neoadjuvant therapy refers to the use of systemic therapy before definitive primary treatment, in an attempt to downstage the primary tumor, eliminate micrometastatic disease or enhance the efficacy of the primary treatment . A large number of clinical trials have explored the benefits of perioperative therapies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer . Systematic reviews, pooled analyses and meta-analyses have been required to demonstrate the purported benefits . Current recommendations supported by practice guidelines indicate the following . All patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stage T2 or above) without distant metastases should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting . Patients considered suitable for systemic chemotherapy should be offered cisplatin-based neoadjuvant therapy . Adjuvant therapy should still be considered for patients requiring urgent surgical management . Patients who are unfit for cisplatin may expect smaller benefits, which may influence decisions about whether perioperative therapy is appropriate . There is no evidence that further postoperative chemotherapy adds benefit for patients who still have viable tumor at cystectomy after preoperative chemotherapy . All suitable patients should be considered for clinical trials, if available and appropriate . Multimodality and bladder-preserving therapy . Whilst radical cystectomy is the curative modality used for most patients with cancer that is clinically confined to the bladder, not all patients are medically suitable for this procedure, or choose not to undergo it . Medically unfit patients may derive better palliative benefit from more conservative therapy such as radiation therapy or best supportive care . Bladder-conserving definitive treatment can be considered for appropriate patients - generally those with smaller-volume cancers . This approach integrates systemic chemotherapy with radiation therapy, the former primarily acting as a radiosensitizer . Finally, some patients may benefit from multimodality approaches combining two or more of surgery, radiation therapy and systemic treatment . A large retrospective study of 348 patients with stage T2-T4a disease assessed outcomes after treatment with cisplatin and radiation therapy in the context of maximal transurethral resection of tumor, and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients were monitored with repeat biopsy, and subsequent treatment was guided by the initial tumor response . Patients experiencing complete remission received additional chemotherapy and a boost of radiation . Complete remission was observed in 72% of patients . Cystectomy was required in 144 patients with suboptimal response or recurrent disease; no patient required cystectomy for treatment-related toxicity . Current recommendations include combination chemoradiotherapy as a reasonable alternative to cystectomy for selected patients . 
Breakthrough CINV . Even with improved control of acute and delayed CINV and adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, breakthrough CINV within 5 days of chemotherapy administration (see page 17) remains a significant clinical problem . Breakthrough CINV usually requires immediate treatment or 'rescue' with additional antiemetics . Clinicians should provide patients with a prescription for rescue antiemetic treatment before the patient leaves the clinic or hospital, so that in the event of breakthrough CINV occurring, treatment can be started immediately . As patients may or may not derive some benefit from the original antiemetic regimen, this may or may not be continued . Agents that are found to effectively treat a patient's breakthrough CINV should be given routinely for at least 3 days rather than on an as-needed basis . The US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest treating breakthrough CINV with an agent from a drug class that was not used in the prophylactic regimen and recommend continuing the breakthrough medication if nausea and vomiting is controlled with that specific agent . The agents used prophylactically to prevent CINV have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of established CINV . Olanzapine and metoclopramide have been the only agents studied for the treatment of breakthrough CINV in phase III clinical trials . During 72 hours of observation, significantly more patients receiving olanzapine had no recurrent emesis (70% vs 31%) and no nausea (68% vs 23%) . On this basis, the NCCN guidelines state that patients who develop nausea or vomiting after chemotherapy (days 1 to 5) despite adequate prophylaxis should be considered for treatment with a 3-day regimen of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day . Refractory CINV . A change in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen should be considered for those patients who develop CINV during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy when antiemetic prophylaxis has not been successful in controlling CINV in earlier cycles . Few studies have examined CINV in this setting . If anxiety is considered to be a major patient factor in CINV, a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or alprazolam can be added to the prophylactic regimen . If the patient is receiving HEC, olanzapine (days 1 to 4) can be substituted for the NK-1 RA in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen . Mild to moderate sedation in elderly patients may be a potential problem associated with olanzapine . NCCN guidelines recommend the use of olanzapine, palonosetron and dexamethasone as an alternative first-line prophylactic antiemetic regimen for patients receiving HEC . This regimen may be useful in patients who experience refractory CINV and need a revision in their prophylactic antiemetic regimen . Anticipatory CINV . If CINV is effectively controlled during the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient is likely to have effective control during subsequent cycles of the same chemotherapy . If the patient has a poor experience with CINV in the first cycle, it may be more difficult to control CINV in subsequent cycles, and refractory and/or anticipatory CINV may develop . The earlier anticipatory CINV is identified, the more likely treatment will be effective . To prevent the occurrence of anticipatory CINV (see pages 17-18), patients should be counseled about their 'expectations' of CINV before the initial course of treatment . Patients should be informed that very effective prophylactic antiemetic regimens will be used and that 70-75% of patients have a complete response (id est no emesis and no use of rescue medications) . For optimum control of CINV during the first course of chemotherapy, each patient should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen based on the specific type of chemotherapy (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2, pages 54-7) and their individual risk factors (see Table 2.2, page 18) before the first course of chemotherapy . If anticipatory CINV occurs despite the use of guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics, additional antiemetic drugs do not seem to be effective . Behavioral therapy should be considered instead . 
The x -axis represents time (t) from randomization and the estimated probability of being event free at time t is plotted on the y -axis . The medians for both OS and PFS, for each of the treatment groups, are clearly identifiable by drawing horizontal lines at probability = 0.5 on the y -axis . Alternatively - to avoid breaking the y -axis - the curves can be plotted with the y -axis representing the probability of the event occurring by time t rather than the probability of being event free at time t . probability of the event = 1 - probability of being . occurring by time t event free at time t . Cumulative incidence curves . Consider the events 'death without progression' and 'progression' . probability of dying without progression by time t . probability of progression by time t . To display results in subgroups within a trial, enabling an assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect . To present results across trials in a meta-analysis . In this chapter, Figure 7.3 displays data from the ToGA trial, comparing the effect of trastuzumab and chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in terms of OS . As mentioned in Chapter 3, the power for a time-to-event endpoint is driven by the number of patients with events and not directly by the number of patients . It would be of value, therefore, within the forest plot (exempli gratia in the column headed 'Number of patients' in Figure 7.3), to give not only the number of patients in each subgroup but also the number of patients with events . An example of a forest plot for presentation of trial data in a meta-analysis is shown in Figure 7.4 . Data for a meta-analysis come from the summary statistics in publications identified as being relevant for a treatment comparison of interest . If the focus is only on published studies, this could result in a biased view of the experimental treatment effect . Waterfall plots can be used to display the change in tumor burden for each individual patient following treatment . Positive values correspond to patients whose tumor burden has increased, while negative values are recorded for patients whose tumor burden has reduced . Displaying waterfall plots for each treatment group, one on top of the other, or color coded on the same plot, can be a useful aid when comparing treatments . Swimmer plots also focus on individual patient data and display key events during treatment and follow-up, such as start of response, end of response, end of treatment, progression and death (Figure 7.7) . Box and whisker plots . Box and whisker plots are good ways to represent aspects of the distribution of an outcome . Finally, all data values outside of the lower and upper whiskers are marked on the plot and considered as outliers . Box and whisker plots are a useful way of displaying data over time or across visits . They can be used to compare an outcome across different tumor types or to highlight differences between treatments: for example, for a particular laboratory parameter (Figure 7.9) . For a laboratory parameter or vital sign measured over time, these medians can be joined across time within each treatment group to help pick up trends . Trends are much easier to identify in a plot than in a table, especially when comparing treatment groups . Relative risks for adverse events . The purpose here is to present key adverse event data in a single plot, which highlights where treatment differences lie (Figure 7.10) . The events displayed in Figure 7.10 are the most frequent adverse events in two treatment groups and are potentially those of greatest concern . The events are ordered according to the value of the RR, so the adverse events with an increased risk are immediately apparent . A shift plot displaying such data in a graphical way can make it easier to interpret the data, especially when data from both treatment groups are displayed in the same plot . In Figure 7.11, each patient can be represented by a single point, with the treatment groups identified using different colors/symbols in the plot . The shift plot in Figure 7.11 has the laboratory value at the end of treatment on the y -axis . Alternatively, it may be the maximum value on treatment that is the most critical value and the y -axis can be defined in this way . Network geometry plots (network meta-analysis) . A meta-analysis combines the results from a series of trials comparing two treatments, A and B . 
By definition, RA can start at any age from 16 upwards, although an equivalent disease also occurs in children (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis) . The overall prevalence of RA in adults is 0.5-1% in most Western populations . The incidence of RA varies by as much as tenfold between studies, and lies between 30 and 300 per 100000 population per year . RA occurs in all societies, with no clear geographic or climatic influence . Historically, RA has been considered a chronic disabling disease that does not shorten lifespan . Consequently, life expectancy in severe RA is reduced, on average, by 7 years for men and 4 years for women . Furthermore, the improvement in life expectancy seen in the general population over recent years does not appear to have extended to the RA population, resulting in a widening gap in mortality rates (Figure 4.1) . The causes of death are largely those prevalent in society as a whole, such as ischemic heart disease, infections and malignancies . RA patients are more than three times more likely to be hospitalized with a myocardial infarction (MI) than patients without RA and almost six times more likely to have a silent MI . RA patients are also twice as likely to develop heart failure, even allowing for traditional risk factors and ischemic heart disease . Subclinical vasculitis could also predispose to atherosclerosis in RA . Lung cancer is also increased in RA, presumably because smoking is a risk factor for the disease, whereas colorectal cancer is reduced, probably reflecting a protective effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) . Infection-related mortality is increased in RA . As well as predisposing to local infections and contributing to the enhanced lung cancer risk, interstitial lung disease per se is a cause of excess mortality in RA patients, as is peptic ulcer disease, the latter largely secondary to NSAID and corticosteroid use . Some recent studies have suggested that early intervention with antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate and TNF blockade has reduced the overall severity of RA, with a concomitant reduction in mortality . The economic costs of an illness are categorized as direct, indirect and intangible . Direct costs are the costs of medicines, and primary and secondary care . For RA, these include the costs of inpatient care, either for rehabilitation or for complications of the disease and joint surgery . Indirect costs represent the consequences of unemployment and reduced productivity . Intangible costs reflect the psychosocial consequences of RA that impact on psychological wellbeing and quality of life . A recent analysis by the UK National Audit Office estimated the annual direct costs of RA to be in the region of £560 million, and total costs up to £4.8 billion per year . The direct costs divide approximately equally between primary and secondary care, with an increasing proportion of spend attributable to biological therapies (£160 million annually) . Work disability in RA varies between studies, but functional disability invariably occurs in the absence of early and effective treatment . A UK-based study from the pre-biologic era, of patients with disease of an average duration of 6 months, reported only 33% of patients with normal function at presentation and 10% of patients with severe disability . By 5 years, 40% had normal function, but 16% had severe disability . Of those initially in paid employment, 27% were work-disabled by 5 years . Other studies suggest an even higher rate of work disability, with a third of patients ceasing work within 2 years of diagnosis, although early biological therapy has had a major impact on job retention and employment prospects . The cost-benefit equation . Several of the newer therapies for RA have been expensive to develop and are costly to manufacture; consequently, their price can exceed $15000 (£10000)/patient/year . Furthermore, some require intravenous administration, which entails additional costs . If efficacy is high, however, the need for other therapies and surgery should be reduced . If, in addition, function and employment are retained, total direct, indirect and intangible costs will be significantly reduced . A recent estimate from the UK National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society suggests that the loss of productivity when a patient stops work because of RA equates to almost £300000 . Thus, the cost-benefit equation for novel RA interventions is complicated and cannot be fully ascertained for several years after their introduction into clinical practice . Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and is a heterogeneous disease . 
Acute myeloid leukemia . Induction therapy . Some patients may need two courses of induction to attain a CR . Post-remission therapy . This may include two phases: consolidation and maintenance therapy . Relatively intensive treatment given soon after achieving CR is generally described as remission consolidation therapy . Treatment-related morbidity and mortality are lower with autologous transplantation . Chances of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection are reduced in well-matched recipients . Targeted therapies . Emerging therapies . Various epigenetic therapies targeting both DNA and histone are currently in preclinical or Phase I development . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia . In general, ALL treatment consists of four components . induction therapy . consolidation therapy . maintenance therapy . central nervous system prophylaxis . Treatment of adults . Principal factors that affect the prognosis are shown in Table 5.2 . Induction therapy . Standard induction therapy involves one of two regimens . Consolidation therapy . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Treatment of adolescents and young adults . However, clinical trial evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking . Treatment of children . The prognosis of ALL is better in children than adults . Typically, children with ALL are assigned a risk status depending on a number of characteristics, including . initial white blood cell count . ALL subtype . spread of disease . chromosome number . presence and type of translocations . speed of initial therapeutic response . In general, children at higher risk are given more intensive therapy than those at lower risk . Induction therapy . Central nervous system prophylaxis . Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Children achieving first complete remission are offered allogeneic HSCT . Treating relapse . New and emerging therapies . Chronic myeloid leukemia . Staging and how to treat . chronic stable phase, a relatively indolent condition that is easily controlled with oral agents . blast crisis (Table 5.4) - most long-term survivors are those who have received HSCT . Treatment options . Multiple factors will influence the choice of therapy in CML, including . the phase of CML . availability of a donor for HSCT . medical comorbidities affecting suitability for HSCT . Chronic phase . However, these trials have not demonstrated improvements in overall survival . Further consensus and recommendations are needed on this . Accelerated or blast phase . interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) with or without Ara-C . omacetaxine mepesuccinate (previously known as homoharringtonine) . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Staging and when to treat . There are two main staging systems for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) . The Rai staging system divides the disease into five stages; it is most often used in the USA . Asymptomatic early-stage disease . Early initiation of chemotherapy has failed to show benefit, and may even increase mortality . Symptomatic or advanced-stage disease . Pretreatment evaluation . testing for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C . chest X-ray to identify hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy . Treatment options . It has also been shown to have a role in consolidation therapy for the elimination of MRD . New and emerging therapies . However, its lack of selectivity potentially compromises its therapeutic index . B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia . Survival is usually 3-5 years even with therapy . Hairy cell leukemia . When to treat . symptomatic splenomegaly (common) or symptomatic lymphadenopathy (uncommon) . constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue or weight loss . Treatment options . Response should be formally assessed 4-6 months after the conclusion of primary therapy . 
Adaptive immunity . The immune system comprises two branches: the innate and adaptive immune response . The innate system has no memory, so both the initial and subsequent responses to antigens are similar . Here, we focus on the immunologic role of the T cell . T-cell pathophysiology . A number of recent studies support immunophenotyping even in early disease to assist in the understanding of treatment-specific options . This is particularly important as we move further into the age of targeted therapeutics . It is therefore important to distinguish erythrodermic MF from SS (Table 3.2) . Mycosis fungoides . The subsequent CCL-17/CCR4 ligand/receptor interaction signals the recruitment of epidermotropic lymphocytes . These are rare in early-stage MF, but common in plaque-stage disease . Epidermotropic lymphocytes, especially those larger than dermal lymphocytes, are a helpful diagnostic clue . However, these may be absent if recent topical treatments have been initiated (Figure 3.7) . Haloed lymphocytes are also helpful in differentiating inflammatory diseases from MF . Plaque-stage disease . Pautrier's microabscesses are usually more readily identified (see Figure 3.3) . Caution must be taken not to overdiagnose these biopsies as squamous cell carcinomas (Figure 3.14) . Variants of mycosis fungoides . Prominent perifollicular eosinophils and granulomas may be present . The destruction of the follicular units leads to clinically recognized alopecia, often termed alopecia mucinosa . Folliculotropism has been known to indicate a worse prognosis and should therefore be included in pathology reports . Syringotropism can occur in pagetoid reticulosis as well . Granulomatous slack skin is very rare . Although most cases of MF are CD7-, many inflammatory diseases that clinically mimic MF are also CD7 . Therefore, care must be taken in interpreting this marker . CD8+ predominant cytotoxic cases also exist (Figure 3.20) . Early-stage MF can present with CD8+ predominance in up to 20% of cases . Clinical correlation is necessary to rule out the clinically aggressive cytotoxic lymphomas . Some authorities perform flow cytometry even in patients with patch-stage disease, though others feel this is not necessary . If lymph nodes are fixed, clustered and/or greater than 1.5 cm, a nodal biopsy is warranted . A bone marrow biopsy should also be considered . Sézary syndrome . This phenotype is associated with central memory T cells . Histopathology of SS can be very difficult to interpret . It can only be distinguished from MF when diagnosed alongside the clinical picture . Laboratory work-up . By definition, patients with SS are at an advanced stage of disease and a complete systemic work-up must be performed . Patients with erythroderma should be screened for HIV and HTLV-1 . As with all CTCLs, interpretation of the data must include clinical correlation . Molecular testing . T-cell receptor polymerase chain reaction . Distinguishing between CTCL and inflammatory disorders has a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 74% . For these reasons, duplicate analyses are recommended to identify definitive clonality . TCR PCR can be particularly helpful if the histopathology is non-diagnostic or if there is a clinicopathological mismatch . With this in mind, the presence of matching clones in the blood and skin are more diagnostically informative and specific for a diagnosis of SS . Next generation sequencing/high throughput sequencing (NGS/HTS) may eventually replace TCR PCR, although it is too early to know for certain . The decrease and eradication of clonal populations seen on NGS/HTS has also been used to identify treatment response . Molecular genetics . For this reason, the molecular genetics of both diseases are discussed here . A novel CTLA4-CD28 fusion oncogene has also been identified in simultaneous studies in MF/SS . 
There remain a number of unmet medical needs in the treatment of ovarian cancer, including improving cure rates and overcoming acquired resistance to platinum . Clearly, novel approaches are needed that exploit critical oncogenic pathways controlling tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis and apoptosis . Precision medicine has become a key strategy in ovarian cancer as a result of advances in a number of areas, including pharmacogenomics, bioinformatics and molecular biology (Figure 8.1) . Ultimately, it is hoped that targeted therapies will offer improved outcomes . Approaches to targeted therapy . The first attempts at developing targeted therapies in ovarian cancer have revolved around the recognition that epithelial ovarian cancers have different prognoses and distinct molecular changes associated with different histological subtypes . By contrast, mucinous and clear cell tumors confer a significantly worse prognosis, and are more usually associated with KRAS and ARID1A mutations . These findings, particularly in tumors with poor prognostic histologies, offer opportunities to design clinical trials targeting these molecular pathways . Several different strategies have been advocated for targeted approaches to ovarian cancer, generally involving identification of a gene or protein that is overexpressed and can be reasonably targeted with acceptable toxicity (Figure 8.2) . If the breaks are not repaired, they accumulate, which in turn results in double-strand breaks leading to cell death . This can result in multiple replication errors leading to chromosomal instability and apoptotic cell death (Figure 8.3) . The inter-relationship between PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutations offers a novel therapeutic strategy, whereby the simultaneous perturbation of two genes results in cell death: this is known as synthetic lethality . As more critical genes and pathways are identified, this strategy is likely to become more widely used to treat cancers . Strategies to increase the number of patients who would benefit from PARP inhibition have led investigators to examine the role of other genes that influence DNA repair in the homologous recombination pathway . In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, a number of other genes such as RAD51 and PALB2 have been shown to play a significant role in the development of ovarian cancer, as described in Chapter 3 . Mutations or epigenetic alterations in these genes result in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) . PARP inhibitors . Four PARP inhibitors have been developed for use in ovarian cancer: olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib . Preclinical data have shown some differences such as the higher tumor penetration observed with niraparib versus olaparib, but the clinical implications of these data remain unclear . As a result, niraparib has received regulatory approval in the USA for maintenance treatment of all women with recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status . Veliparib is another highly selective PARP inhibitor that has been developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer . Current studies are investigating combinations of PARP inhibitors with anti-angiogenic therapies and immuno-oncologics (see below) . In addition, most PARP inhibitors are being assessed in earlier lines of therapy, including front-line treatment . Anti-angiogenesis therapies . There are a number of angiogenesis pathways that represent promising therapeutic targets; indeed, to date, inhibition of angiogenesis has been the most successful targeted strategy in ovarian cancer . The concept is that if the immune system can learn to recognize malignant cells as foreign antigens, a robust T-cell mediated response, among other pathways, could be induced . Cancer cells evade these tumor-directed T cells by subverting immune checkpoint pathways and other immune-regulatory mechanisms . This observation has led to the identification of numerous targets and therapeutic strategies with checkpoint inhibitors and other agents (Figure 8.4) . These agents have shown remarkable long-term responses in multiple solid tumors, and are approved in a number of cancers including melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and urothelial cancers . Given their mechanisms of action, these agents may show survival benefit without inducing a significant objective response . It should be noted that these agents can cause significant and life-threatening adverse effects, including inflammation of the liver, lungs and colon . It has been suggested that a combination of immune agents with PARP inhibitors might be beneficial, because tumor mutations and DNA alterations can generate neo-antigens that have been associated with an improved response to immune checkpoint therapies . 
Trigeminal neuralgia is an idiopathic paroxysmal recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal (fifth cranial) nerve (Figure 4.1) . Pain is usually caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal ganglion or its branches (Figure 4.2), but bony abnormalities or otherwise inapparent multiple sclerosis (MS) can also be associated with trigeminal neuralgia . Although up to 15% of people with MS have trigeminal neuralgia, it is only rarely (0.2%) diagnosed before MS . Rarely, a space-occupying lesion (exempli gratia tumor) in the cerebellopontine angle can be a cause of trigeminal neuralgia, particularly if there is loss of sensation in trigeminal territory - sometimes called atypical trigeminal neuralgia . About 5% of people with trigeminal neuralgia have other family members with the disorder, which suggests a possible genetic cause in some cases . Because there are no objective tests for trigeminal neuralgia, clinical manifestations are the mainstay of diagnosis . Trigeminal neuralgia is more prevalent in women than men by a ratio of 3:2 . It can occur at any age, but usually has its onset in individuals over 50 years old . Clinical features . Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal and recurrent attacks of facial pain that are sudden and unilateral, and that follow the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve . Pain is precipitated from trigger areas or by innocuous daily activities such as eating, talking, washing the face or brushing the teeth . Patients describe the severe, often excruciating, pain as sharp, stabbing or burning in quality, usually lasting between seconds and less than 2 minutes . A few progress to less intense persistent pain between paroxysms . Remission can be months and even many years, but generally the attacks become shorter over time . Attacks can occur up to 70 times daily, terrifying patients because of their severity and unpredictability despite their brief duration . Other diagnoses such as idiopathic (atypical) facial pain, muscular pain, dental pain or one of the headache syndromes (exempli gratia cluster headache or migraine) should be considered if the pain is bilateral or continuous and if there are no evident provoking factors . Rarely, a combination of trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headache may occur (cluster tic syndrome) (see Chapter 12) . In general, 1 in 3 individuals receiving carbamazepine will experience pain relief . Other options include the gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin), particularly in older people or in patients who are unable to tolerate carbamazepine . In patients with unresponsive pain, it may be necessary to use a systemic infusion of lidocaine (lignocaine), aiming for a blood concentration of 1-2 μg/mL . If medical management has failed and the patient can tolerate surgery, microvascular decompression of the trigeminal neural complex (also known as the Jannetta procedure) is the preferred treatment . This procedure directly treats the cause of the problem without destroying any neural tissue . Pain relief persists in more than 85% of patients at 5-year follow-up, with no risk of sensory loss . Many patients have complete abolition of pain - a result that is attainable for very few chronic pain conditions . In older patients, percutaneous radiofrequency lesioning of the affected components of the trigeminal complex is the method of choice . This is a rapid and highly controllable procedure that aims to minimize risk of sensory loss . However, pain tends to recur after about 3 years and about 5% of patients have painful sensory loss (anesthesia dolorosa) . Patients who elect to undergo repeat procedures should be informed of the increased risks . Because of the severity and unpredictability of episodes of trigeminal neuralgia, patients with ineffective treatment pain are at increased risk of suicide . Risk of suicide is discussed in Fast Facts: Depression . The authors of this text have treated many patients with trigeminal neuralgia who fail to respond to medical management or who have unacceptable side effects . Such patients must be given access to the invasive procedures described above, particularly microvascular decompression (MVD), in view of the high success rate . 
Acne often occurs at an age when an individual is experiencing significant psychological and social changes . It is therefore not surprising that acne often leads to loss of self-esteem, anxiety, problems mixing with peers and, at times, significant depression . It is common for acne to produce a loss of motivation in carrying out day-to-day activities such as shopping, socializing and going away for a weekend or holiday . Television commercials and the media may exacerbate this, as a cosmetically acceptable appearance is often portrayed as being inherently linked to social success . Acne may also be a predisposing factor for anorexia; vulnerable teenagers may adopt an extreme diet in an attempt to control their acne . Recognizing psychological distress . However, patients' parents or physicians do not always fully appreciate the psychosocial effects of the condition, which is frequently dismissed as merely a cosmetic problem . Health professionals need to be aware of the significant variation in the degree of psychological distress that acne causes in different people and to appreciate the differences in patients' coping skills . Clinicians may be dismissive about a mild case of acne, yet the patient may exhibit significant psychopathology . Assessing psychosocial effect . Adopting a QoL measure as an integral part of acne management is recommended . Acne scarring . Acne scarring (see pages 22-3) can cause significant disfigurement and correlates with psychological problems; it is also very difficult to treat . The identification of scarring is an important part of initial assessment . When scarring is evident, early and effective therapy must be implemented to minimize further scarring; this requires urgent specialist attention . Some patients will require additional support but securing this can be a challenge . Acne as a symptom of other psychological disorders . Body dysmorphic disorder . A small number of patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) have acne as their prime dysmorphic symptom . The acne is usually mild or non-existent and the patient's complaint does not correlate with the physical signs . These patients are often depressed or have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) behaviors, anxiety and depression . A significant risk of suicide in these patients has been reported . Patients with BDD require significant support and expert dermatological and psychiatric management, as many have global mental disorders . Patients for whom BDD is the only behavioral symptom may gain relief by treating their mild acne aggressively . Isotretinoin has been given in this context but relapse, either real or perceived, is common and requests for further isotretinoin are frequent . Acne excoriée is a self-inflicted skin condition in which the affected individual compulsively picks real or imagined acne lesions, predominantly on the face (Figure 4.2) . The disorder can develop into dermatitis artefacta . Acne excoriée is predominantly seen in adolescent girls and young women, although the incidence also appears to be increasing in mature females who have apparent late-onset acne . It is frequently seen in the context of anxiety and stress . A personality or psychological problem, such as OCD or body-focused anxiety, frequently underlies the condition . Evidence of linear erosions indicates self-mutilation, and underlying psychiatric disease should be suspected . An atopic background may be evident and patients often complain of significant pruritus in the lesions . The persistent trauma to lesions can result in significant scarring . If active acne is evident, treatment should be employed to reduce the lesions . However, a word of caution is necessary here, as sometimes topical treatment has a tendency to irritate and aggravate the problem . Doxepin and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline have also been reported as helpful . Hypnosis and habit reversal techniques may also be effective treatment options . Treatment for the facial scarring and ulceration resulting from acne excoriée has been improved using the 585 nm pulsed dye laser along with cognitive psychotherapy . Eating disorders . Acne has been reported in association with the starvation employed to reduce and maintain a low bodyweight in individuals with anorexia nervosa . Levels of serum growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have been shown to be altered in anorexia: serum growth hormone levels are raised, while IGF-1 levels are concomitantly low . 
This requires the assistance of all healthcare professionals and, most importantly, patients and their advocates . Once European biosimilars are approved, local implementation is up to member states, which formulate their own biosimilar policies . As there are different prices and reimbursement procedures, as well as incentivization of stakeholders, it is unsurprising that there are variations in biosimilar uptake . The European Commission has organized four large stakeholder meetings on biosimilars, from which several key themes have emerged . communicating with one voice . implementing policies to enhance uptake of biosimilars . redesigning pricing and reimbursement policies . Formulary committees need to recognize that communicating the safety of their decisions to all the stakeholders in that process requires education . To us, being confident about why biosimilars show no clinically meaningful differences to reference biologics comes from two sources . understanding the 'big science' that lies behind their development and regulatory approval . Communicating with one voice . This model was disrupted by the success of the Norwegian Health Service policy for introducing biosimilars of infliximab . Infliximab represented the greatest regulatory challenge for biosimilars for several reasons . It was the first monoclonal antibody . It was prescribed for at least six major indications requiring extrapolation for biosimilar approval . One key indication was rheumatoid disease, which is characterized by high rates of antibody formation against therapeutic antibodies; this is the most frequently identified reason for loss of efficacy in rheumatoid disease . Last, typical treatment schedules may cover many years, such that annual competitive drug tenders could drive regular brand switching for individual patients . gov NCT02148640) . Training and development of 'drug optimization pharmacists', who were hospital pharmacists, were key . Support materials . The EMA also now publishes a public-friendly summary of each European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains why each biosimilar medicine brand has been approved for use in Europe . All are available to use or adapt from one central website at the EMA (www . eu/en/medicines) . Medicines for Europe represents the interests of generic and biosimilar producers . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also begun to develop a similar role with central education through a national Biosimilars Action Plan . Implementing policies to enhance uptake of biosimilars . The Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE) explored drivers of biosimilar uptake and reported that approximately half of European countries have incentives for physicians to prescribe biosimilars . Prescribing targets and quotas have been used in the more centralized health systems of the UK, France, Belgium and Germany . In the more diverse insurance-based market of the Netherlands, limited reimbursement of reference medicines has been enforced by insurance companies . Austria and Norway rank choices about biologics with a clear best-value recommendation to follow unless the prescriber can provide a valid clinical reason not to use the cheapest product . In the USA, where biosimilars are a more recent option, there are less data to share . However, there are already established step-therapy biosimilar policies reported by Network Bulletin . Redesigning pricing and reimbursement policies . In contrast, the UK and Germany have no price controls but organize large competitive tenders, with competitive tenders and ceiling price limits in Norway, Malta and Serbia . In the Europe, drug tenders are covered by competition law that works to open markets . Furthermore, the pharmaceutical company may have bundled the reference biologic with other agents in deals to exclude biosimilar products from rivals . Differentiation by manufacturers . Manufacturers also have a business case for promoting biosimilars or, conversely, for slowing their uptake . In contrast, biosimilars are deemed by regulators to be either equivalent or not equivalent - a binary decision, with analytics being the dominant driver of that decision . This is a novel situation for many producers, for whom brand differentiation on clinical outcomes has been a mainstay of promotion . Formulary decisions about the choice of biosimilar would then be driven by price and convenience, as is the case for generic drugs . This offers little opportunity to claim technical superiority of one biosimilar over another, as all versions of a drug will have been determined comparable . The regulator requires only that equivalence has been shown in a suitably sensitive pharmacodynamic endpoint with the full approval based on the totality of the evidence . 
T cells acquire several identifiable markers during maturation . Precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma . The tumor is usually defined as LBL when there is no obvious blood involvement and only minimal bone-marrow involvement . Many cases of T-cell ALL/LBL will also stain for CD10 . In patients with ALL, fatigue, breathlessness, infection and bleeding are more usual . Both LBL and ALL are treated with leukemia protocols . In older adults, the disorder is associated with a very poor prognosis . Large granular lymphocyte leukemia . Most LGLs also express CD3, but a small proportion express NK markers only (Figure 7.2) . The clinical manifestations of LGL leukemia are diverse . Patients in whom LGL leukemia is an incidental finding may require no specific therapy . Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . The cells express CD4 and CD25 (IL-2 receptor) . Another unusual feature of this disease is the very high prevalence of associated hypercalcemia and, less commonly, lytic bone lesions . CNS involvement is a devastating complication that most often occurs on relapse . The prognosis of ATLL is generally poor and very few patients survive for more than 1-2 years . A small number of patients have disease with a more indolent course . The relatively high incidence of CNS involvement at relapse may be an indication for some form of CNS prophylaxis . Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified . Treatment is with CHOP or equivalent chemotherapy . Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma . The malignant cells are characteristically large and express the T-cell marker CD3 together with CD30 . ALK expression is due to a fusion gene produced by the t(2;5) translocation . This translocation juxtaposes the genes for ALK and nucleophosmin . The localized cutaneous anaplastic large-cell tumor does not usually express translocated ALK . The purplish/reddish raised skin lesions typical of the disorder will often undergo spontaneous regression and healing . Radiotherapy may occasionally be used for more stubborn or unsightly lesions . Angio-immunoblastic lymphoma . The histological appearance varies from 'reactive looking' to frankly and obviously malignant . The disease is usually very aggressive and the optimal treatment has not been defined . Although combination chemotherapy, such as CHOP, is used frequently, the results are poor and novel treatments are being evaluated . Enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma . Many patients succumb early in the course of disease because of their poor nutritional state . Initial management may involve surgical resection followed by combination chemotherapy, usually CHOP . Supportive care is crucial for such patients, because of their poor nutritional state . High-dose therapy may confer some benefit in patients who respond to initial therapy and who have a good performance status . However, the outcome is generally considered to be poor . Natural killer cell ('nasal') lymphoma . NK lymphomas are extremely aggressive tumors that characteristically arise in the nasal septum and adjacent structures . The tumors are locally destructive and difficult to treat . They appear to be more common in patients from Southeast Asia . The tumor expresses an NK phenotype (CD56+) and is almost always positive for Epstein-Barr virus . The tumor is often resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Most patients survive for only a few months . The etoposide regimen known as SMILE has been shown to have response rates of around 30% . Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome . Mycosis fungoides is the most common cutaneous lymphoma . The skin is infiltrated by CD4+ malignant lymphocytes with nuclei that have characteristic cerebroid morphology . Mycosis fungoides often starts as a single innocent-looking plaque, which is easily ignored by the patient . However, over time, more and more plaques appear, prompting a request for medical assessment . Simple plaque disease can be treated with topical corticosteroids or topical chemotherapy, such as nitrogen mustard . For more generalized skin involvement, phototherapy is the treatment of choice in combination with psoralens . 
Bleeding events such as nose bleeds, large bruises and heavy menses are often elicited by a thorough history . It is the clinician's responsibility to discern which patients actually have a clinically significant bleeding disorder that may predispose to excessive, troublesome or potentially serious bleeding . It is usually easy to distinguish clinically between a severe bleeding disorder and a mild bleeding disorder in that the former bleed frequently and spontaneously with minimal provocation, whilst the latter bleed only occasionally . It may be much harder to distinguish those with a mild bleeding disorder from those who are 'normal', even after extensive clinical and laboratory evaluation . The assessment of an individual patient is a two-stage process, comprising: history and focused clinical examination; and laboratory investigation . Laboratory investigation of the patient's blood involves screening tests, measuring the concentration of specific clotting factors and assessing platelet function . Taking the history . A full general medical history and examination should be undertaken, and the bleeding symptoms recorded in the context of the patient's overall health and lifestyle . Site of bleed . Duration of bleeding . Bleeding symptoms over a long period of time suggest a lifelong congenital bleeding disorder, while those of recent origin may be more in keeping with an acquired medical disorder (exempli gratia liver disease) . Bleeding that arises spontaneously reflects the presence of a more severe bleeding state than hemorrhage that occurs only after surgery or trauma . It can also be helpful to know when bleeding starts after surgery . Bleeding that starts immediately indicates a platelet abnormality or von Willebrand disease . Family history . A positive family history of a bleeding disorder can be helpful in directing investigations (exempli gratia hemophilia) . Furthermore, in a mild bleeding disorder the degree of bleeding symptoms may vary among different members of the family because of the co-inheritance of other causes of a mild bleeding state . Acutely ill patients often have multiple reasons for bleeding (exempli gratia septicemia, uremia and the effect of drugs) . Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) is widely used as an antithrombotic; it induces a mild predisposition to bleeding in most individuals and may unmask an underlying lifelong mild bleeding disorder . Assessment of children . Any child presenting with unexpected bleeding should be carefully and immediately assessed, especially in relation to any family history of a bleeding disorder or if the clinical circumstances suggest the possibility of non-accidental injury . Bleeding scores are being developed and evaluated as potentially useful quantitative clinical indices that summarize the number and severity of bleeding episodes . Weighted values are given for epistaxis, bleeding from minor wounds, gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia, muscle and joint hemorrhages and surgical bleeding . Superficial examination . Hemophilia is characterized by acute hemarthroses or evidence of previous joint damage from recurrent bleeds . General examination . If severe thrombocytopenia is suspected, the optic fundi should be examined for evidence of retinal bleeding . The extent of the investigations will depend on the likelihood of the patient having a bleeding disorder as determined by the history and physical examination . If the history is not particularly suggestive of a bleeding disorder, these investigations may be sufficient (and will exclude most severe bleeding disorders) . These features distinguish this disorder from the more common immunologic thrombocytopenias . If the platelet count and morphology are normal, but a platelet function disorder is suspected, further investigation is necessary . Bleeding time . In disorders of primary hemostasis the cutaneous bleeding time may be prolonged, but this is not always the case . Bleeding time is not a good test of platelet or VWF function (partly because it is invasive and very difficult to standardize), and is little used these days . Platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 test . It reliably reflects the effects of ASA (aspirin) on platelet function, but may be normal in patients with mild hemostatic defects; therefore, a normal test should not be used to exclude platelet function defects in individuals with a positive bleeding history . It should be noted that FXII deficiency is not associated with a predisposition to bleeding . These screening tests are only prolonged when a clotting factor is reduced to below about 25% of normal levels; therefore, if there is a high clinical suspicion of a mild bleeding disorder, the levels of individual coagulation factors must be measured . 
This chapter offers a broad overview of staging and management of a patient with lymphoma; Chapters 5-9 provide a more detailed discussion of the individual lymphoma entities, while Chapters 10 and give detail of treatment modalities and the management of treatment side effects . Nodal and extranodal lymphoma . Lymphomas can affect any organ of the body and are divided into . nodal lymphomas, affecting the lymph nodes or spleen . Recognizing that lymphomas may affect sites outside the lymph nodes is important, because it has a direct bearing on their management . Extranodal sites must be monitored during and after treatment to assess response to therapy . Management steps . The management of any patient with lymphoma follows the same path . initial therapy . restaging to determine response to chemotherapy . completion of therapy . Staging determines the site (Figure 4.2) and extent of a lymphoma . Staging and a general work-up are mandatory in all cases and should include the following . Bone-marrow biopsy and aspirate are a standard staging investigation for most types of lymphoma . Some centers routinely screen every new patient with lymphoma for HIV, while others restrict screening to patients with known risk factors . Staging system . From the results of imaging and bone-marrow biopsy, the lymphoma can be staged by the Ann Arbor system as follows (Figure 4.3) . Staging also takes into account the presence of 'B symptoms' . B symptoms are . night sweats that drench and wake the patient . Absence of B symptoms makes the patient stage A . It is important to provide the following . verbal and written information about the disorder and its treatment . chemotherapy (single agent or combination) . high-dose therapy with stem-cell support . Combination chemotherapy generally improves the response rate compared with single-agent treatment . Many drugs are active against lymphoma, but perhaps the best known combination is CHOP . In view of this, the treatment paradigm for patients with indolent lymphomas is changing . For younger fitter patients, the advent of new therapies has improved survival and a more active approach to therapy is typical for these patients now (see below) . Management of side effects . Mood changes are an important problem with corticosteroid-based chemotherapy . Some patients may become psychotic and require expert psychiatric management . Hair loss occurs with several chemotherapy drugs . The impact of chemotherapy on fertility is important and must be discussed before treatment starts . Both the type and the dosing regimen of chemotherapy determine the impact of treatment on fertility . Management of bone-marrow suppression . A very important aspect of the delivery of chemotherapy is the likely effect on the patient's normal blood count . Patients with low platelet counts can be given platelet transfusions . Patients who develop a fever following chemotherapy need urgent assessment and may need hospital admission to receive intravenous antibiotics . Response to chemotherapy . The response to chemotherapy determines the subsequent management of the patient . However, as new techniques emerge, response definitions change . The most recent response criteria adopted for lymphomas include the use of functional imaging, with PET scans for patients in clinical trials . In view of this, many clinical trials are exploring whether a change of treatment for patients who are 'PET-positive' will improve their outcome . One of the central dilemmas of lymphoma management is the interpretation of residual masses following chemotherapy (Figure 4.4) . Indeed, 60% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma are found to have residual masses on completion of chemotherapy . Clearly, if there is active lymphoma, the mass will usually have grown . Biopsy is usually recommended to ensure that the lymphoma has not changed . Biopsy must be followed by full staging . Patients who relapse after initial therapy will usually be given a different chemotherapy regimen . In this situation, patients will usually be offered platinum-based chemotherapy (see pages 55 and) followed by high-dose therapy and stem-cell rescue . For indolent lymphomas, relapse may or may not require active therapy . If required, treatment with a different class or combination of chemotherapy is administered . However, a more aggressive approach may be indicated in younger patients . 
Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist when indicated is essential if the potentially serious consequences of children's eye problems are to be avoided . Routine referral is appropriate for . a child with a head tilt or turn (possible congenital fourth nerve palsy) . Eye discharge or watering . Ophthalmia neonatorum . Causative organisms include gonorrhea, chlamydia and herpes simplex virus (HSV) type II, which can also cause meningitis, encephalitis and other systemic infections . For this reason, neonates suspected of having ophthalmia neonatorum should be managed as an emergency by both a neonatologist and an ophthalmologist . Conjunctivitis alone (without systemic infection) can also be due to common, less virulent bacteria . Congenital glaucoma is a rare but serious eye condition in which the child is born with persistent high pressure in one or both eyes . Congenital glaucoma does not cause red eyes, but does result in corneal and eye enlargement . Prompt surgical treatment can save the child's sight . Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is very common . It presents as persistent watering or sticky discharge from one or both eyes, without eye redness, photophobia, or corneal enlargement or clouding . This often corrects itself within the first year to 18 months of life . Nasolacrimal duct probing under general anesthetic by an ophthalmologist can be performed after this time if the problem has not spontaneously resolved . Children of all ages may develop the usual types of conjunctivitis (viral, allergic and bacterial; see Chapter 2) . Suspected poor vision . A normal and healthy infant usually makes eye contact with the parent in the first 8-12 weeks of life . Assessing children's vision before they can talk may be difficult, but you can present them with various toys of different sizes and note their reaction, and observe how well they visually fix and follow the targets, as well as observing their general visual behavior . If, however, the cause of poor vision (exempli gratia congenital cataract) is identified and treated urgently, permanent blindness from amblyopia may be prevented . The earlier a child with poor vision in one or both eyes is referred to an ophthalmologist, the better the chance of preventing permanent visual loss . In the case of a squint, amblyopia may often be partially or fully corrected by patching the 'good' eye under close ophthalmic supervision . For these reasons, the ophthalmic assessment of children with poor vision is a matter of some urgency . Abnormal red reflex or 'white pupil' . The normal red reflex seen with a direct ophthalmoscope in a dark room is a diffuse orange or red glow from both pupils . Do not forget that you see the red reflex by looking though the direct ophthalmoscope a few feet away from the patient . You can check both red reflexes at the same time in the same field of view because of this distance from the patient . This also allows a direct comparison of the red reflex in both eyes at the same time . If the red reflex on one or both sides is abnormal (Figure 10.1), a serious intraocular abnormality such as congenital cataract (dull or absent red reflex) or retinoblastoma (white reflex) is likely . Alternatively, you or the parents may notice that one or both pupils looks white or gray, rather than black . Squint ('turned eye', strabismus) . Any child with a squint should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist to determine its underlying cause . Children with squints usually do not (if they are old enough to talk) complain of double vision, because their brain 'switches off' the image from the deviated eye . Nystagmus (continually moving eyes) . Nystagmus in children can also occur for all the same reasons as in adults, including brain tumors or middle-ear disease . Optic disc abnormalities . Abnormal optic discs in children always require ophthalmic assessment . Swollen discs may represent papilledema due to a brain tumor or hydrocephalus . Pale discs may be associated with other congenital brain abnormalities or a tumor of the anterior visual pathway . 
Two in every 10 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) will experience a recurrence . This chapter we will address which etiologies that are more prone to recurrence and how to avoid it . Most patients with AP will have a complete recovery, but sequelae can develop, especially in moderate-to-severe disease . Prevention of recurrence . Correctly diagnosing the etiology of AP is important in guiding appropriate action to prevent the patient experiencing a recurrence . The etiology for most patients will be diagnosed during their index hospital admission by means of anamnesis (to determine possible drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse, etc . laboratory findings (hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia, etc . and conventional ultrasonography (gallstones) . Patients with an obscure etiology should undergo endoscopic ultrasonography, which can accurately diagnose gallbladder microlithiasis/sludge and pancreatic solid and cystic tumors . CT is also useful for detecting solid tumors, and MRI can diagnose cysts and ductal abnormalities . Genetic testing is usually performed in cases of otherwise idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis . Table 9.1 lists the imaging features that suggest autoimmune pancreatitis . Increased serum immunoglobulin G4 is associated with type I autoimmune pancreatitis but the sensitivity and specificity are far from perfect (frequent false-negative and -positive results) . Manometry to diagnose sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is seldom used, and is available only in some very specialized tertiary referral centers . Observational and experimental data therefore support same-admission cholecystectomy in cases of mild gallstone AP . Observational studies suggest that it still lowers the risk of AP recurrence and even mortality in this population . In patients with local complications, the timing of cholecystectomy is controversial . Based on these data, it is currently recommended that cholecystectomy should be delayed in patients with local complications . A follow-up imaging examination 1-2 months after discharge will help to plan the timing of cholecystectomy . Other obstructive etiologies . Endoscopic sphincterotomy is clearly indicated in cases of choledocholithiasis . Benign strictures of the main pancreatic duct can be managed initially by means of endoscopic dilation and stenting; in some cases, surgery will be needed . The role of ERCP in pancreas divisum with a narrow dorsal duct is yet to be determined . Alcohol and tobacco . Avoidance of alcohol is associated with a lower rate of recurrent AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis . The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on initial management of AP recommend a brief alcohol intervention during admission . Smoking is an independent factor for recurrent AP and chronic pancreatitis (see page 19) and smoking cessation seems to decrease the frequency of progression to chronic pancreatitis . For these reasons alcohol and smoking abstinence should be strongly advised . For the patients, it is usually easier to stop drinking than smoking . Diet, fibrates and other drugs are available for controlling triglyceride levels . Other etiologies . Specific treatment should be given to patients with hyperparathyroidism and autoimmune pancreatitis . There are no effective measures against recurrence in truly idiopathic AP . Late complications . Some patients will experience significant late complications following an episode of AP, including . diabetes mellitus . exocrine pancreatic insufficiency . progression to recurrent and chronic pancreatitis . Diabetes mellitus . The beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin, a key hormone that regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins . The inflammation and damage to the exocrine pancreas associated with AP can affect the gland's endocrine tissue . The incidence of diabetes increases with time (20% prevalence within 5 years, 37% when considering follow-up beyond 5 years) . Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency . Patients with clinical steatorrhea should receive pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment (PERT) directly . Fecal elastase-1 is very useful as a screening test for EPI in this setting . Recurrent AP and chronic pancreatitis . Male sex is also associated with an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis . 
The majority of patients will not benefit from antibiotic treatment, and it is thus not indicated . However, it is important to treat asymptomatic infections in a small number of patient groups, as summarized in Table 7.1 . Recurrent urinary tract infection . Anaerobic infections of the urinary tract are rare . In the elderly patient, mental changes, malaise and confusion may be the only presenting symptoms of a UTI . The majority of investigations, however, will be normal, and treatment should be on the basis of symptoms . Antibiotic treatment is recommended for patients with recurrent UTIs . However, urine culture before treatment is important, given the widespread resistance to antibiotics . Breakthrough infections should be treated with full doses of appropriate antibiotics . However, some patients may need to continue daily prophylaxis for life . An alternative to prophylaxis is to allow patients to self-medicate . Patients are provided with 3 days' full-dose antibiotic treatment to take when they experience the symptoms of acute cystitis; the symptoms of UTIs can be accurately identified by 85% of women . Bladder pain syndrome and interstitial cystitis . The diagnosis of IC is confined to patients with painful bladder symptoms who have characteristic cystoscopic and histological features . It is commonly accepted that IC predominates in women . These changes are generally considered to be late changes, and many patients with BPS/IC have no specific cystoscopic findings . The diagnosis of BPS/IC is based clinically on symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency and pain . Pain is an essential component of both conditions and is traditionally described as increasing pain on bladder filling that is relieved by voiding . Diagnosis of BPS or IC requires the exclusion of other causes of the bladder symptoms, such as infection, malignancy, radiation or drug-induced cystitis . These cystoscopic findings are not necessarily diagnostic, however, as not all patients with petechial hemorrhages have IC, and vice versa . There is some disagreement about the role of cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in the diagnosis of IC . Once the diagnosis of BPS/IC is made, the next decision is whether to initiate treatment or to consider a course of 'watchful waiting' . The natural history of the disorder is not fully understood, and the proportion of patients whose symptoms will resolve spontaneously is not known . Treatment is not always necessary if a patient's symptoms are tolerable and do not impact significantly on quality of life; there are few data to show that treatment will significantly alter the natural history of the disorder . However, patients who present with BPS/IC should receive behavior modification treatment, as described in Table 7.4 . Options for treatment are summarized in Tables 7.4 and 7.5 . A wide variety of foods has been implicated and special diets for patients with BPS/IC are provided in patient information . Not all foods affect all patients in the same way so it is important to advise patients to avoid only those foods that affect them . Modifying certain behaviors can improve symptoms in some IC/BPS patients and can reduce the frequency of voiding . Oral treatments . Tricyclic antidepressants used in the treatment of BPS/IC are listed in Table 7.6 . It has been used in the treatment of BPS/IC and is useful in the management of pain at a titrated dose of up to 75 mg daily . There is currently no role for antibiotics in the management of BPS/IC in the absence of a laboratory-proven UTI . Although this is the only oral agent approved for the treatment of IC, expert opinion of its efficacy is divided . Several drugs are available for intravesical therapy of BPS/IC . Agents are given weekly or every 2 weeks for a total of 4-8 treatments . Long-term remission will be achieved in some patients with this approach, but in most the condition will relapse eventually and require additional treatments . Treatment with intravesical agents does not require anesthesia or hospital admission, and some patients can be taught to self-administer the drugs . Invasive treatment should be reserved for patients with debilitating symptoms in whom conservative treatments have failed . It may be helpful for the symptoms of urgency and frequency but does not appear to improve pain associated with BPS/IC . However, results are generally poor for classic BPS/IC . Urinary tract infections and cystitis . 
Basic principles . The majority of patients (70%) initially present with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) . Intravesical chemotherapy with mitomycin and immunotherapy with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) are the most commonly used approaches . Treatment of NMIBC involves the multi-step interventional strategies summarized in Table 5.1 . Initial surgical management . Prognostic factors . Following initial surgical management and determination of stage and grade, the following additional risk factors are assessed . tumor size (< 3 cm vs >= 3 cm) . whether this is the first occurrence or a recurrent tumor . tumor focality (unifocal vs multifocal) . presence or absence of CIS . Prognostic groups . The European Association of Urology adds a highest-risk group which should be treated with radical cystectomy . The risk strata inform decisions about the use of adjuvant therapy and surveillance schedules . Power and Izawa have compared and contrasted current NMIBC guideline recommendations . A calculator based on European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer clinical trials (eortc . be/tools/bladdercalculator) is a useful tool for risk stratification . Low-risk tumors . Mitomycin is the most commonly used drug in this setting, and epirubicin is available in Europe . The recent report of the SWOG S-0337 trial provides additional level-I evidence for the use of gemcitabine . Intermediate-risk tumors . Small-volume Ta HG cancers are included in this risk stratum in the American Urological Association scheme (Table 5.2) . These patients should receive a course of intravesical therapy following resection (see below) . Mitomycin is the most commonly used cytotoxic drug . BCG induction plus maintenance for 1 year is also an option . Radical cystectomy is the standard of care, supported by multiple guidelines . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined a registration pathway based on a single-arm trial that has led to multiple ongoing clinical trials in this disease stage . Intravesical therapy . Historically, doxorubicin and mitomycin have been the preferred agents because systemic absorption is limited by their high molecular mass . BCG provides optimal therapeutic benefit for the eradication of CIS . Optimal delivery of mitomycin is achieved by doubling the dose and concentration compared with historical doses of 20 mg/20 mL sterile water . An 'optimized' treatment algorithm supported by level-I evidence includes the following additional measures . alkalinizing the urine by the oral administration of bicarbonate on the evening before and the morning of treatment . minimizing the residual urine after catheterization of the bladder . keeping the patient fasted throughout treatment in order to minimize urine production . These measures effectively doubled the 5-year recurrence-free survival, from 25% to 50% . The absorption of mitomycin may be optimized by the delivery of heat or iontophoresis . BCG is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that stimulates an immune response without causing tuberculosis . A disadvantage of BCG is its toxicity, which is greater than that of intravesical chemotherapy (Table 5.3) and may be substantial during maintenance courses . Given the success of BCG immunotherapy, several other immunotherapeutic agents have been investigated . The most clinical experience has been gathered for recombinant interferon alfa-2b (Intron A ®, Schering Plough) and bropirimine . Surveillance following initial diagnosis and treatment . Routine surveillance for NMIBC with cystoscopy can be risk adjusted . If recurrence is detected, the patient returns to the start of this schedule . However, they must be told that any future episode of hematuria requires investigation . Lifelong surveillance is usual in the USA but an optimal schedule has not been defined . Results are not available for several days, and some expertise is required to perform the test and interpret the results . Tumor markers . Various urinary markers for bladder cancer are being evaluated; these are compared in Table 4.1 . 
Clinical overlap can occur between these conditions and definitive laboratory testing can be time-consuming at a time when patients are usually critically ill and require immediate treatment . STEC-HUS (typical or diarrhea-associated HUS) . HUS is defined by the simultaneous occurrence of TMA with acute kidney injury . Renal involvement is typically much more severe than with TTP and the patient often presents with oliguria or anuria . Traditionally, HUS was divided into diarrhea-positive and diarrhea-negative, but this is now known to be inaccurate as patients with aHUS may also present with diarrhea . STEC-HUS is the most common form of HUS . It is primarily caused by STEC infection (E . It can occur at any age, but it usually affects children younger than 5 years . It can occur sporadically or as an epidemic and is associated with ingestion of contaminated food or water . The TMA most commonly follows recovery from the acute diarrheal illness . Treatment is usually supportive and includes intravenous fluids and transfusion support . Presentation can be similar to that of STEC-HUS, with acute renal failure and acute TMA findings . However, this has been shown to be unreliable in differentiating between the two, as patients with aHUS may present with neurological injury . A definitive diagnosis of aHUS can be confirmed by detection of complement gene mutations or antibodies to factor H if present, but up to 40% of individuals with aHUS may not have a detectable complement mutation . Drug-induced TMA . Most patients recover normal renal function within several weeks simply by stopping the drug and with supportive care . TMA can develop during the first few weeks of treatment and usually resolves with discontinuation of the drug . The following may present with acute TMA findings and may need to be excluded clinically before a diagnosis of TTP or aHUS can be made . DIC is characterized by thrombocytopenia associated with raised D-dimers . Fibrinogen may be reduced in very severe DIC . Systemic infections . Other than STEC, TMA can be seen secondary to severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection with either severe pneumonia or meningitis; it is usually seen in children . Solid organ and stem-cell transplant TMA . TMA may occur through a mixture of mechanisms, including drug toxicity from the immunosuppressing agents mentioned above, severe infections or, in the case of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease . A TMA associated with stem-cell transplant that is clinically similar to aHUS also occurs . These are usually associated with progressive or metastatic disease, commonly with hepatic involvement . Pregnancy-associated TMA . Systemic lupus erythematosus can present similarly to iTTP in rare cases . ADAMTS13 activity in these cases would be low and patients are treated as other patients with iTTP, with additional intervention for the underlying SLE . The diagnosis typically becomes apparent in infancy, but the condition can also occur later in older children and, rarely, in adults . To complicate matters further, aHUS can have accelerated hypertension as a clinical presentation . Laboratory findings include anemia, reticulocytosis and thrombocytopenia . Therefore, routine screening for B12 and folate levels should be undertaken in acute TMA presentations . Sickle cell disease . Immune-mediated TTP . The finding of ADAMTS13 activity below 10 IU/dL confirms the diagnosis of TTP . Congenital TTP is much less common than iTTP . Mutation studies can then be used to confirm a cTTP diagnosis . During early childhood, the differential diagnosis includes STEC-HUS, aHUS and secondary TMA associated with diseases of early childhood . Childhood ITP is usually acute, often occurring after a viral infection or vaccination, and usually resolves spontaneously within weeks to months . TMA is not a common feature and anemia is not pronounced unless there is significant bleeding . Neurological findings are not common unless there is intracranial hemorrhage, which can happen in severe thrombocytopenia . It is diagnosed by clinical history and is differentiated from TTP by lack of TMA findings . 
Inherited disorders . Mutations in membrane glycoproteins . Bernard-Soulier syndrome is due to mutations in membrane glycoprotein Ib-IX-V . It is characterized by excessive menstrual blood loss, bleeding from mucous membranes and major hemorrhage following trauma and surgery . Defects in platelet storage organelles or granules . Dysfunction of cytosolic enzymes and other platelet constituents . In addition, chronic blood loss may necessitate iron supplementation . Women usually require hormonal therapy to control menorrhagia . Patients should carry documentation describing the nature of their bleeding defect with them at all times . If platelet transfusions are needed, single-donor platelets are usually preferred . Acquired disorders . Minoxidil inhibits the synthesis of platelet prostaglandins . The black tree fungus, used in Szechuan cooking, inhibits platelet aggregation . Primary (essential) thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative disorder that results from a clonal proliferation of stem cells . JAK2 mutations are observed in 50-60% of patients . Bruises, bleeding gums and major gastrointestinal hemorrhage occur . Careful scrutiny of a freshly prepared blood film is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia . The first step is to confirm that the platelet count is truly decreased and then to detect whether other blood abnormalities are present . Examination of the blood smear will also provide information about platelet size . Once a diagnosis of thrombocytopenia has been established, it is imperative to ascertain an exact etiology . A careful history to determine recent exposure to alcohol, herbal medications or other tonics, quinine water or unusual foods and other drugs may implicate a culprit agent . If such features are absent from the history, an immune thrombocytopenia is most likely . The overall incidence is 2.5 per 100 000, but in those over 60 incidence increases to 4.5 per 100 000 . Detailed inquiry should be made about recent exposure to drugs or herbal medicines . However, all patients should be tested for hepatitis C and HIV . Table 4.5 shows some of the agents used for the management of symptomatic primary immune thrombocytopenia . Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) G . A lower incidence has been reported for more recent preparations manufactured without the addition of sucrose . Preoperatively, the platelet count is raised by administering high doses of corticosteroid . Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy (see Chapter 10) . Benign gestational thrombocytopenia does not require treatment; observation alone is adequate . However, primary immune thrombocytopenia during pregnancy may become more severe as pregnancy progresses . The thrombocytopenia usually resolves within 1-2 weeks . Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is discussed in Chapter 10 . Thrombocytopenia associated with hepatitis C virus and HIV . In the later stages of HIV infection, atrophy of the marrow may occur, with pancytopenia . Iatrogenic causes of thrombocytopenia . Drug causes are uncommon, with an estimated population incidence of 1-2 cases per 100 000 per year . Non-drug causes . Management of thrombocytopenia . All new medications or tonics should be discontinued and serial platelet counts obtained . If the patient is not bleeding, watchful waiting is appropriate . However, major or life-threatening hemorrhage necessitates platelet infusion . Platelet transfusions are indicated to . correct dilutional thrombocytopenia resulting from multi-unit transfusion of packed red cells in conjunction with surgery or trauma . marrow replacement by malignancies . marrow depletion by chemotherapy or radiation . marrow impairment associated with hematopoietic cell transplantation . One apheresis unit is equivalent to six random-donor units in terms of platelet numbers . Transmission of infectious agents may also occur; careful donor assessment and screening for viruses in the donation will substantially reduce this risk . Platelet products must also be screened for bacterial contamination . 
The joints most commonly affected are the . first metatarsophalangeal joint . OA is a syndrome of joint pain and stiffness with associated functional problems, which can have a substantial effect on quality of life . It is difficult to estimate the true global prevalence of OA as many studies consider only hip and knee OA . Estimates of incidence and prevalence also vary according to the definition of OA used; for example, symptomatic versus radiographic criteria . Radiographic OA is more common than symptomatic OA, and detection rates in a given joint may increase when more radiographic views are obtained . In the hand, the most common combinations of joints affected by radiographic OA are the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints with or without the carpometacarpal joint . However, because ultrasound can visualize the joint in three dimensions, studies using ultrasound have suggested metacarpophalangeal joint OA to be more common than radiographic studies suggest . Individual joints demonstrate a striking age-related rise in the prevalence of radiographic OA . About one-third of all adults have radiographic OA of the hands, with two-thirds over 75 years of age exhibiting OA of the distal interphalangeal joints . Radiographic OA of the knees has also been found in about a third of adults over 60 years of age (Table 3.2) . The prevalence of radiographic OA (particularly of the hand and knee) is higher in women than men, especially in individuals over 50 years of age . The prevalence of large joint radiographic OA in joints other than the hand is higher in African-Americans than in American whites . Symptomatic OA . Joint pain is common, but not all joint pain is attributable to OA (depending on the definition of OA and extra-articular causes of pain such as tendonitis); indeed, about half of those with radiographic OA report no symptoms . Women report more pain than men: worldwide estimates suggest that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women over 60 years of age have symptomatic OA . African-Americans tend to report greater pain and disability than Caucasians . Many people have multiple joint pains: a study in individuals over the age of 55 suggested a median number of four painful joints (though not all will be OA) . The most common combinations of joint pain are knee and foot pain, knee and back pain, and knee and hand pain . So, while knee pain affects about a quarter of the adult population, the prevalence of a painful disabling knee attributable to OA in the UK population over 55 years of age has been estimated at approximately 10% . Statistics from the USA put the prevalence of a painful OA knee in adults over 45 years of age at 16% . Impact on the individual . OA affects individuals in many complex ways, including . restricted participation in activities . Pain is the commonest reason for patients to present to their family physician; over half of all people with OA say that pain is their worst problem . Often the concepts of pain and stiffness are not clearly distinguished by people with OA . In a detailed survey (the UK OA Nation Report 2012) of 2001 individuals with OA, 79% reported having to give up or reduce activity because of their OA . Furthermore, when OA pain was 'at its worst', two-thirds struggled with stairs and around half had trouble getting out of a chair . These problems are much worse when people have multiple joint pain - for example, people with knee pain alone have three times more difficulty in walking than people without knee pain, but the combination of knee, back and foot pain results in 30 times the difficulty . Restricted participation in activities . People with OA report poor self-esteem, loss of independence and a considerable effect on close relationships . Studies suggest that the presence of such comorbidities magnifies the impact of OA on the individual; conversely, having OA may affect an individual's ability to manage some comorbid conditions . OA made up 22% of these visits, with joint pain contributing a further 36% . The costs to individuals with OA are significant . In addition, many Western societies have a substantial and increasing prevalence of obesity, which also increases the OA burden . 
The most fundamental differentiation is between primary intracranial lesions and metastatic tumors . Primary tumors can be further subdivided according to whether they arise from the brain parenchyma, meninges, pituitary region, pineal region or skull base . Neurological symptoms and neuroimaging provide information about tumor location, which is useful in developing a differential diagnosis (Table 1.1) . However, definitive diagnosis of primary brain tumors is based on the cell of origin and requires histopathological assessment . The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system is used widely (see Key references) . Most intracranial tumors arise from the brain parenchyma, primarily from glial cells (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes) . Primary neuronal tumors are uncommon . Meningeal tumors are the second most common type of intracranial tumor . Tumors also arise from a variety of other cell types, including some not ordinarily found in the brain (exempli gratia germ cells, lymphocytes and embryonic rests) (Figure 1.1) . Incidence and epidemiology . Brain metastases are much more common than primary intracranial tumors . Approximately 170000 people in the USA are diagnosed with brain metastases every year, while 62930 are diagnosed with a primary benign or malignant brain tumor . More than 13000 die each year as a result of a primary malignant brain tumor . In children and in men aged 20-39 years, brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the USA . Data from several studies suggest an increase in the incidence of both primary brain tumors, particularly primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, and brain metastases since the 1970s . This may be partly due to a true increase in incidence, but it is also a consequence of greater access to and improvements in neuroimaging techniques . Epidemiological studies of brain tumors are limited as a result of ascertainment bias, small sample size and retrospective design . The best data suggest an annual worldwide incidence for primary brain tumors of 3-4/100000 person-years . The incidence of primary brain tumors varies by sex, race, age and geography . Men have a higher risk than women of developing most brain tumors, with the exception of meningiomas . Similarly, brain tumors are more common in white than other ethnic groups, with the exception of meningiomas and pituitary adenomas . Brain tumors are more common in developed countries . Numerous other risk factors have been reported (Table 1.2) but the studies are generally small and their findings have not been confirmed . An increasing number of molecular genetic alterations have been described in association with particular primary brain tumors (Table 1.3) . For glioblastoma in particular, recent genetic studies have delineated at least three genetically distinct subgroups . In the majority of patients, it is likely that some combination of genetic and environmental factors leads to the development of a brain tumor . Developments in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics are resulting in an exponential increase in our knowledge about all types of brain tumors, and should lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies . 
Chronic infection with the hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) virus is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide (Table 7.1) . There are an estimated 300 million hepatitis B carriers worldwide and the prevalence of hepatitis B ranges from 0.1 to 20% . The prevalence of hepatitis C also varies geographically and ranges from 0.5 to 15% . Hepatitis is considered chronic when the infection is present for more than 6 months . The prevalence of hepatitis B infection varies worldwide; the highest rates are seen in Asia . Chronic hepatitis B is evaluated on the basis of serological profiles, liver function tests and, in some cases, liver histology . A number of patterns of disease are recognized . persistent replication with evidence of ongoing hepatitis . intermittent flares in viral replication, which may trigger episodes of hepatitis . Serological assessment of chronic hepatitis B can appear complex (Table 7.2) . HBsAg is present in all cases of chronic infection . Seroconversion from HBeAg to HBeAb may cause hepatitis-like symptoms; patients come to clinical attention during this process . Chronic hepatitis develops in 90% of infants and in 5% of adults acquiring the infection . The spectrum of liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis B includes . Many patients with chronic hepatitis do not develop significant liver disease during their lifetime . Once cirrhosis develops, 85% of patients remain stable for a further 5 years, but the risk of developing symptoms of liver failure increases significantly thereafter . The risk of developing HCC once cirrhosis has developed is 1-2% per year . Interferon clears the virus in about 40% of cases by increasing immune responsiveness to the virus . More recently, peginterferon has been used for the treatment of HBV infection . Liver decompensation associated with active viral replication has the potential to be dramatically reduced with effective suppression of viral replication, and patients apparently in need of liver transplantation can recover and defer the need for transplantation for many years . The overall burden of hepatitis B on transplant resources is therefore decreasing . In the absence of reinfection, the results of liver transplantation for hepatitis B are comparable to those for other patient subgroups . Hepatitis D (delta) virus is an incomplete virus that can exist only in association with hepatitis B infection . It can be acquired with hepatitis B or can be superimposed on established disease . The incidence of hepatitis D appears to be decreasing . Hepatitis C virus is an RNA virus . Intravenous drug use was associated with an infection rate of approximately 70%, and tattooing has resulted in infection with hepatitis C in up to 30% of cases . The prevalence of hepatitis C varies geographically and ranges from 0.5-1% in most Western countries to over 15% in parts of Africa . Serological assessment of hepatitis C includes . Hepatitis C is also associated with a phenomenon called quasi-species, which denotes the presence of many strains of the virus within an individual patient . The acute infection is rarely clinically identified and, in most cases, the likely timing of infection can only be determined from an assessment of the risk factors for acquisition of the virus . About 85% of those infected become chronic carriers . Infected individuals express a range of liver disease, ranging from mild hepatitis to cirrhosis . Patients over 40 years of age also have more aggressive disease . Once cirrhosis develops, the superimposed risk of developing HCC is in the order of 1-2% per patient-year . Liver transplantation . Liver disease associated with hepatitis C is now the most common indication for liver transplantation in most countries . Unlike hepatitis B, the burden of hepatitis C on transplant resources is increasing and is not expected to peak for another 10-15 years . The indications for liver transplantation are the same as for hepatitis B . Nevertheless, a proportion of patients who are HCV RNA negative at the time of transplantation following antiviral therapy do not develop recurrent infection . Developments in antiviral strategies are expected to be of special benefit to these patients, particularly the significant minority (20-30%) who were at risk of accelerated disease, with cirrhosis developing as early as 3-5 years after transplantation . As a result, the survival rate for hepatitis C was lower than for other indications 8 years and more after liver transplantation . 
The treatment for bulimia involves a stepped care approach, starting with primary care and/or self-help programs; this is followed, as necessary, by hospital outpatient or day treatment, then inpatient treatment in a general psychiatry unit or, preferably, specialist unit-based therapies . Recent studies on the treatment of bulimia have demonstrated that, for adults, cognitive interventions and antidepressants, especially selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are effective . The primary goals of treatment for bulimia are . to help a patient stop bingeing and purging . to address other psychological issues related to the primary diagnosis of bulimia . Non-pharmacological treatment . The most commonly used treatments for patients with bulimia are psychological and patient-led interventions . behavioral techniques . family and marital therapy . group therapy . support groups/stepped programs . Cognitive-behavior therapy comprises four distinct phases for patients with bulimia . Therapy is slowly tapered when the patient shows consolidated signs of progress . Patients with bulimia benefit from learning alternative means of dealing with negative emotions such as anxiety . Family and marital therapy . Two studies of the family environments of patients with bulimia showed that punishment contributed to overall outcome difficulties and was indicative of poor family functioning . There have been promising results in studies of adolescents with bulimia who still live with their parents . For example, a pilot study found that treatment of female patients (aged 14-17 years) with brief family therapy resulted in significant decreases in bulimic behavior at 1 year . Group therapy . Patients who demonstrate particularly poor social skills and who appear particularly susceptible to group or societal pressures toward thinness may benefit from group therapy targeted at bulimia recovery . Support groups/stepped programs . Some patients have found groups and programs such as Overeaters Anonymous to be helpful, in conjunction with initial treatments, for the prevention of relapses . These programs, however, should not be used as the primary treatment for bulimia . Further development of such programs may prove to be important in providing treatment to patients who otherwise would not have access to adequate care . IPT has not been systematically studied in young people . Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) . Pharmacological treatment . Although the mainstay of treatment for bulimia is non-pharmacological, more research has been conducted on the pharmacological treatment of bulimia than of anorexia . Antidepressants have been used in the treatment of bulimia with encouraging results, and about 30% of patients benefit from pharmacotherapy alone . Fluoxetine is commonly used for the treatment of bulimia; it is approved for use in bulimic patients in the UK and it is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this eating disorder . In general, higher doses of SSRIs are used for the treatment of bulimia than for depression, with careful monitoring of side effects . Care must be taken in patients with . Although there had been initial evidence supporting the efficacy of imipramine and desipramine for bulimia, these are now considered to be an outdated treatment for bulimia . Other medications . Numerous other agents have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of bulimia in double-blind placebo-controlled studies . Monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine have been used for the treatment of bulimia . It is not recommended because there are insufficient supportive data and understanding about the physiological outcomes in bulimia . Optimizing treatment . Up to 70% of patients with bulimia benefit from a combination of medication and cognitive-behavior interventions . In one study, CBT produced better results than treatment with fluoxetine, and although a combination intervention showed some benefit, there was a high rate of attrition . In another study, intensive group cognitive psychotherapy demonstrated greater efficacy than imipramine for the treatment of bingeing, purging and the symptoms of depression . Some patients find support groups helpful . Treatment of bulimia . Studies of treatment options for bulimia are more advanced than those for anorexia . The focus of the majority of these studies is on young adult populations . For patients suffering from bulimia, the most common modes of treatment involve psychological therapy, medication or a combination of both . 
The treatment of glioblastoma includes recognizing and managing a host of disease- and treatment-related complications . This chapter focuses on several of the most common conditions associated with glioblastoma . More than half of patients with cancer who experience fatigue never tell their doctor about it, but as it is one of the most common symptoms experienced by patients with glioblastoma it is important to ascertain whether it is a problem . It may help if the patient keeps a 'fatigue diary', including a note of activities that make the fatigue better or worse . If the patient is fit enough, then a light to moderate level of exercise or physical therapy should be encouraged . Steroids can be prescribed, but patients should be made aware of the likely short-term adverse events, including raised glucose, thin skin, easy bruising, gastric irritation and the increased risk of infection . A systematic review of 42 observational studies involving 4089 patients with primary cerebral glioma (varying stages) reported a median frequency of depression at clinical interview of 15% (range 6-28%) . Depression was associated with reduced physical function, cognitive impairment, reduced quality of life, caregiver distress and reduced likelihood of returning to work . The risk of depression was not affected by sex or older age, or with tumor location, histology, grade or extent of resection . The authors considered depression to be primarily a psychological response to the loss of health . A retrospective study reported that almost 22% of 160 patients with glioblastoma took a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor during treatment for glioblastoma without affecting the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy or compromising survival . Localization of high-grade gliomas to the temporal lobe or cortex may also cause seizures . Surgical resection may induce seizures if, for example, the tumor is localized to the temporal lobe . Conversely, resection may reduce the incidence of seizures if they are being caused by edema or the mass effect of the tumor . In a retrospective analysis of 103 patients with glioblastoma, 22% (all with IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastoma) experienced seizures . Patients with seizures had smaller tumors, which caused less edema than non-epileptogenic tumors . Glutamate carrier systems were significantly upregulated in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic tumors, resulting in 'oversupply' of glutamate . The authors concluded that epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic tumors were morphologically different . Antiepileptic drugs are recommended for patients who present with seizures, but prophylactic use outside the perioperative phase is not advised . Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with intrinsic brain tumors, with an annual incidence of up to 20% . Risk factors include glioblastoma molecular subtype (exempli gratia patients with IDH1 -mutant glioblastoma have a lower incidence of VTE than those with an IDH wild-type tumor), paresis, neurological deficits, immobilization, surgery and steroid use . The risk of VTE is increased by a tumor-induced hypercoagulable state . As there is no evidence that anticoagulation therapy prevents VTE in these patients, prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended, but vigilance for suspicious indicatory symptoms is required . Glioma is not a contraindication to standard anticoagulation in patients with established thrombosis . Steroids can be used to decrease tumor-associated edema and improve clinical symptoms . Physicians should make a clinical decision on the optimal starting dose of steroids after assessing the patient . Steroids are not indicated in the absence of edema-associated neurological deficits or if intracranial pressure is normal . Prolonged steroid use after resection is not recommended, and prophylaxis with steroids is not required during radiotherapy in asymptomatic patients . Prolonged exposure to steroids is not advised because of the potential for side effects . The dose of steroids should be tapered and discontinued where clinically appropriate . Monitoring of blood glucose during steroid therapy is advocated, given that in a retrospective study of 393 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide, a time-weighted mean glucose of 6.3 mmol/L was independently associated with longer overall survival (p > 0.005) . 
Causes of diagnostic delay . Common factors that lead to diagnostic delay include . failure to recognize initial symptoms . failure to recognize the progression of symptoms . referral to a specialty other than neurology . inappropriate spinal or peripheral nerve surgery . A pragmatic approach to diagnosis . Effective communication of this uncertainty requires experience and confidence . Hidden clues . Fasciculation or cramps without weakness . Positive voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies are found in 50% of patients with this condition . Neuromyotonia has a characteristic appearance on electromyography . Incidental spinal spondylosis . It is often erroneously referred for orthopedic intervention . Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy . Treatment is supportive . It only affects males, and it is much rarer than ALS . Gynecomastia may occur . Treatment is supportive . Dysphagia may occur in up to one-third of individuals . Progression is slower than in ALS . Treatment is supportive . Spinal muscular atrophy . The severity is determined mainly by the level of residual survival motor neuron (SMN) protein . Reflexes are usually absent, though not always . MMN is potentially reversible with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy . A trial may be warranted in the absence of demonstrable conduction block in a younger individual . Although such individuals may experience a subjective sense of benefit, it is short lived . Neuralgic amyotrophy . There may be a preceding viral illness or vaccination . Most individuals (95%) experience severe pain in the absence of trauma . However, rare painless variants also occur . It is followed by quite rapid quadriceps weakness and wasting that often becomes bilateral . It is almost exclusively seen in young men aged 16-25 years . Fasciculation is not prominent . There is no consensus on optimal management, but repeated extreme neck flexion and extension should be avoided . Invariably the weakness arrests over months with good functional adaptation . The pathology is thought to represent a secondary vasculopathy of the radicular vasa nervora . Limb muscles apparently spared by the previous infection may be involved . It has been suggested that this represents a decompensation of occult damage unmasked by natural aging . There is no evidence for virus reactivation and management is supportive . It is considered to be within the spectrum of neurodegeneration . MMND affects males and females equally . Mean survival is more than 30 years . The pathogenesis and histopathology are unclear . Recessively inherited and CNS-involved forms have also been described . A degree of urinary frequency with urgency is common . Clinical signs are usually bilateral . Solitary sclerosis of the cervical cord or lower brainstem should be excluded . Other neurodegenerative disorders . Parkinsonian syndromes . Some cases of ALS overlap with Parkinsonism . It has a male predominance . Metabolic myelopathies . It causes a slowly progressive myelopathy evolving over 10-20 years . Abnormal MRI signs may be absent . Treatment is supportive . The damage is permanent . Progressive bulbar palsy . EMG, including of the tongue, may be normal . Muscle biopsy is typically definitive . Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy . CK is often raised, though only modestly (300-1000 U/L) . Cognition appears to be unaffected . Treatment is supportive . More widespread clinical signs of neuromuscular dysfunction are absent . Routine MRI scans of the brainstem are usually diagnostic . Treatment is supportive . BVVL progresses to involve respiratory and limb weakness . A bibrachial diplegic variant has also been described . Paraneoplastic syndromes . Implausible differential diagnoses . Lyme disease . They do not resemble the clinical course of ALS . burgdorferi infection . 
A multidisciplinary approach is an absolute requirement for optimal care of the parkinsonian patient . Many patients find the support offered by organizations such as Parkinson's UK helpful (see Useful resources, (pages 161 -) . A Parkinson's disease nurse specialist (PDNS) can spend more time with the patient and can offer telephone support . Some patients may need specialist counseling to help them to come to terms with the diagnosis . Parkinson's disease nurse specialist . The PDNS is skilled in patient and carer assessment, differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and appropriate drug treatment, medicines management and communication . The role of the PDNS in the care of patients with Parkinson's disease has been reported in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), although the methods used in these studies have varied widely . The studies reported that PDNS care allowed a swift implementation of good clinical practice for Parkinson's disease, including home visits, and a high rate of patient satisfaction . Ongoing support . In the early stages, the main focus is often on drug therapy . Despite this, some patients will need a wheelchair outside the home . Other studies have addressed small numbers of patients only; for example, one randomized trial evaluated 8 patients in a 16-week aerobic exercise program . Home exercise programs are popular with patients with Parkinson's disease as they can be tailored to their individual needs and practiced within the safety and comfort of their own home . Adaptation of the home is often necessary when the patient becomes more disabled . Occupational therapists assess the safety of homes, particularly when the patient is prone to falling . Social services may need to be involved to make such changes and to assess the need for financial assistance . In the past, there has been little evidence to support the use of interventional occupational therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease; however, new studies have shown efficacy . Often the brunt of care falls on a patient's spouse or partner . Additional help may be needed to assist the patient with dressing, toileting or bathing . Consultations with the patient should include the carer, with attention given to the carer's mental and physical health and to whether additional support is needed . Patients who hallucinate or have dementia often provoke social crises and cries for help from carers . These are the most difficult problems for patients with Parkinson's disease and their carers, and occur in at least 30% of cases . Swift action is required, and the availability of a PDNS is often invaluable . The first step is to rationalize drug treatment, removing those drugs that are least effective or most likely to cause hallucinosis . Despite this, patients with dementia frequently cannot be managed at home and will need to be admitted to a nursing home, either for respite care or on a permanent basis . The PDNS can advise nursing homes on effective management of patients with Parkinson's disease who have dementia, and the importance of regulating their medication . Demented patients who are prone to wander may need a locked facility . Advice from a dietitian may be needed if a patient's nutritional intake is thought to be poor . An early warning sign is when the patient does not finish meals . A double-blind placebo-controlled trial reported good efficacy for Movicol in the treatment of constipation in patients with Parkinson's disease . Patients often ask how food interferes with drug treatment . Even without drug treatment patients often feel worse in the afternoon, which may be due, in part, to a fall in blood pressure after a large meal at lunchtime . Bladder symptoms . In elderly men, symptoms are often a result of both Parkinson's disease and prostatic hypertrophy . It is necessary to rule out additional urinary infection before any treatment . Skin care . Although skin problems related to parkinsonism are common, patients rarely complain about them . Sexual problems are not uncommon and are usually the concern of male patients; these issues need to be addressed with the patient as they are often important in terms of overall quality of life . Palliative (not terminal) care . The need for palliative care in Parkinson's disease indicates a stage when drugs are no longer well tolerated, the patient is an unsuitable candidate for surgery and there is considerable comorbidity . Usually, the Parkinson's disease nurse or specialist will recognize this stage of the disease process and support and initiate the appropriate care with specialist palliative care professionals . Respite for carers . 
Implantable cardiac defibrillators . Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the major predictor of outcome and sudden death . The complications are similar to those experienced with pacemakers . There is an increasing trend to avoid intravascular leads . Defibrillators in non-ischemic cardiomyopathies . Cardiac resynchronization therapy . There are two types of ventricular dyssynchrony . interventricular dyssynchrony in which the left and right ventricles no longer contract simultaneously . Right ventricular (RV) pacing is a well-established, safe and effective technology . The technology . The coronary sinus ostium is accessed using a specialized sheath system . Once the sheath is placed within the body of the sinus a balloon occlusive catheter is inserted . The leads are connected to a pacing generator . Types of device . Cost implications . Mortality was reduced by 32% in the CRT group (Figure 8.5) . Exercise capacity is significantly increased, as is quality of life . There is also a significant reduction in the readmission rate for decompensated HF . Possible contraindications are shown in Table 8.3 . Increasingly, CRT is used earlier in treatment . Identifying these patients has also been a challenge . AV and VV optimization . In addition, serious doubt has been cast on its reproducibility . Recent studies have shown a positive outcome comparable to echocardiographic assessment . Specific risks relating to CRT include . failure to implant the left ventricular leads (< 5%) . late lead displacement (8%) . phrenic nerve stimulation (< 10%) . Other risks are similar to those of any standard pacemaker implant . infection (early < 1%; late 1.5%) . lead dislodgment (1-5%) . Cardiac contractility modulation . The signal is timed to coincide with the absolute refractory period of the ventricle . Cardiac surgery . Outcomes were similar in both groups; the reduction in LV volumes did not confer an outcome advantage . Mitral valve surgery is covered in Chapter 3 . Left ventricle assist device . Available LV assist devices include . extracorporeal (pulsatile and non-pulsatile) . implantable (pulsatile and non-pulsatile) (Figure 8.8) . total artificial heart . The pumps are either hydraulic or electromagnetic, and based on either an axial or centrifugal design . The devices can deliver cardiac output of up to 10 L/minute . The pump rhythm is completely dissociated from ventricular rhythm . Complications are frequent and potentially life-threatening . They differ according to the time of implantation (Table 8.4) . 35% failure rate at 2 years (none after 1 year) . 28% device infection rate after 3 months . 42% bleeding rate after 6 months . Patient selection . It is currently used as a bridge to transplantation, but work continues to make it ready for potential destination therapy . A synthetic fully functional mechanical heart is one of the holy grails of medicine . While transplant recipients outnumber organ donors there will be a drive to develop this technology . The first mechanical heart was used as a bridge to transplant in 1969 . A number of versions of the device have been made since . Pulmonary infection is also common (up to 20%), as are neurological events (15%) . Cardiac transplantation outcomes have been steadily improving over the last 30 years . Although highly successful, the major limitation is the availability of donor hearts . Patient selection . Age is one of the most controversial exclusion criteria for transplantation (Table 8.6) . Those who are hemodynamically unstable are referred for mechanical support . Transplantation is a major psychological trauma, and family and social support are key to a successful outcome . A life-long commitment to therapy and follow-up is required . The commonest causes of morbidity and mortality after transplantation are listed in Table 8.7 . 
A biosimilar, as its name suggests, is highly similar to the reference biological product (see below), but it is not identical . Differences in formulation, presentation and the administration device are permitted, provided that these differences do not affect safety or effectiveness . As with all biological medicines, the challenge for manufacturers and regulators is to ensure that copies of biologics are similar in structure and function to the reference product and have no clinically meaningful differences in outcomes (Table 2.1) . The rationale for biosimilars is economic; the transition from small molecule drugs to biologics has markedly increased drug expenditure, although this has been accompanied by improved outcomes . The high prices of biologics are justified by manufacturers on the basis of the investment in discovery, development and production . An opportunity to reduce costs . While discussion of costs may make some clinicians uncomfortable, attention to the health budget is a reality of modern medicine . Given aging populations and the rising prevalence of chronic conditions and cancers for which biologics are used, biologics represent a major demand on healthcare budgets that are already under pressure, and rationing measures are inevitably applied . The substantial savings realized can improve patient access by allowing more patients to be treated from the same budget . Thus, biosimilars will enable stakeholders - including payers, clinicians and patients - to benefit from greater choice of treatment options, and more patients will have access to these treatments (Figure 2.1) . The potential to reduce medicine costs today is significant; of the 12 bestselling global medicines of 2018, nine were biologics and six of those with total sales of US$54 billion face biosimilar competition now or in the near future (Table 2.2) . If biosimilars of those six could be sold at 50% discount, savings would deliver US$28 billion a year to reinvest into global healthcare . Additional savings can be predicted - over the next 7 years a further 35 biologics face loss of patent and potential biosimilar competition . The 2018 European Commission meeting on biosimilars provided an opportunity to assess biosimilar impact after a decade of use . The first conclusion from the meeting was that lack of price transparency made data-driven economic assessments - such as those made by IQVIA (formerly Quintiles and IMS Health) - difficult . However, the potential savings associated with biosimilars under this level of discount are illustrated in Figure 2.2 . Opening markets to biosimilar competition could enable healthcare systems to realize savings of more than €10 billion in the EU's five major markets (EU M5; UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy) between 2016 and 2020 - based solely on direct competition for the originator molecule; further savings are possible through indirect competition for other in-class or therapy-area-specific product sales . Cumulative savings of €49-98 billion could be realized in the EU M5 and the USA combined for this period, although the extent of the actual savings depends on policy development and implementation across all stakeholders in the healthcare system . Brand switching and extrapolation of indications . Furthermore, as the market for the drug has already been created, promotion and marketing expenses should also be significantly reduced . Economics also sets the agenda for the evidence needed to use biosimilars in practice; while biosimilars must be clinically similar, they have no utility to health systems unless they can be economically different . The key driver of price reductions is competition between brands, with more brands marketed creating greater competition and thus discounts . To maximize price-volume discounts, pharmacy formulary managers will want to stock, ideally, only one preferred brand of each biologic; this mandates the use of biosimilars in extrapolated indications . Also, to maximize discounts over time, repeat tender process cycles will be needed - mandating that biologics and biosimilars can be switched between different brands as part of the typical 1-2-year competitive drug tender purchase cycle without excess risk to patients . Note that prescribing of biosimilars is entirely in keeping with the concept of rational prescribing, as defined by WHO: Medicine use is rational (appropriate, proper, correct) when patients receive the appropriate medicines, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost both to them and the community . To ensure effective uptake of biosimilars, clinicians and other healthcare professionals should be informed of the benefits and safety of biosimilars . Persisting concerns can also be addressed - there have been no efficacy or safety concerns during the first decade of biosimilar use in Europe . 
The immune system has evolved to protect the host against infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, and to detect and eliminate potentially harmful foreign material . An understanding of the basic elements of the normal and tumor-altered immune system is therefore key to understanding potential immuno-oncology therapies . The immune system consists of two components: innate immunity and adaptive immunity . Innate immunity . In addition to the physical barrier of skin and membranes, innate immunity is primarily conferred by phagocytic cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow . Phagocytes are attracted to foreign material, such as a pathogen, and engulf it in a process known as phagocytosis . The foreign material is then contained inside an endosome, and digested by enzymes and acids contained in organelles known as lysosomes . Phagocytosis is facilitated by the complement system (Figure 1.2), a cascade of plasma proteins that . form holes in the plasma membranes of pathogens, leading to cell lysis . label pathogens for destruction by coating the cell surface (opsonization) . recruit inflammatory cells to sites of infection or injury . eliminate antigen-antibody complexes . The role of inflammation in immune responses . Inflammation is a primary immune response to tissue damage resulting from infection or injury . Neutrophils in turn release cytokines that trigger the recruitment of further immune cells . redness due to local vasodilatation . heat (either localized to the site of injury or systemic fever) . swelling of affected tissues . Importantly, inflammation is a feature of almost all neoplastic lesions and has been recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer . These include . production of growth factors, proangiogenic factors and other agents capable of promoting tumor growth . activation of cell growth patterns leading to high-grade malignancy . production of reactive oxygen species and other potential mutagens . Adaptive (acquired) immunity . Adaptive immune responses are primarily mediated by lymphocytes, and may be categorized according to the type of lymphocyte involved . humoral immunity is mediated by B cells derived from bone marrow . Recognition of self and non-self . Cellular immunity . If this process is incomplete, autoimmune diseases may arise . There are two types of CD4+ T cell responses . Th2 responses are effective against extracellular bacteria and parasites, and are characterized by production of interleukin (IL)-4 and -5 . T reg cells regulate the immune response to common environmental allergens and prevent the development of atopy or undesirable inflammation . However, their role in maintenance of peripheral tolerance is also used by cancers to evade the immune system . To prevent extensive tissue damage during an infection, activation of CD8+ cells requires three signals (Figure 1.4) . binding of the antigen to the TCR . The antibodies bind to the antigen, rendering it more susceptible to phagocytosis and triggering the complement system . Inter-relationship between innate and adaptive immunity . There is a close inter-relationship between the innate and adaptive immune systems, which is mediated via cytokines and other messengers (Figure 1.6) . One well-characterized function of NK cells is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) . Development of immune tolerance . Immune tolerance is a state in which the immune system is unresponsive to a stimulus that would normally provoke an immune response . It is an important mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system . Immune tolerance may be central or peripheral, depending on where it is induced . central tolerance is induced in the thymus and bone marrow . peripheral tolerance is induced in lymph nodes or other tissues . Central tolerance is the principal mechanism by which the immune system learns to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self' . Some autoreactive B cells may be retained in a state in which they do not respond to stimulation of their receptors . Peripheral tolerance plays a key role in preventing hyperreactivity of the immune system in response to environmental agents such as allergens or gut microbes . Autoreactive T cells that are not eliminated in the thymus can be neutralized by nT reg cells, as described above .
