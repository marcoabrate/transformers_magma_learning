While it can be used as sole treatment, it is often integrated in a multimodal strategy with surgery and chemotherapy . Patient selection . Patients with interstitial lung disease are rarely suitable . Patients with poor lung function may still be eligible provided they have been adequately counseled about the long-term risks of breathlessness . Unsuitable candidates for radical radiotherapy should be offered other palliative options . Radical radiotherapy delivery . The target volume is defined using information acquired from diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans . Mediastinoscopy is required to aid nodal definition if the CT and PET findings are inconclusive . As the tumor can move, respiratory motion management is mandatory when planning and treating the patient . The planned target volume then accounts for any tumor excursion . Modern techniques used to deliver radical radiotherapy include three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) (Figure 4.1) . Conventionally, fractionated radiotherapy is administered, usually with a daily dose of approximately 2 Gy . Hypofractionated radiotherapy refers to dose fractions greater than 2 Gy and allows acceleration of treatment . Hypo- or hyperfractionated treatment have the potential for increased late toxicity . The principal schedules are . conventional fractionation: 64-66 Gy in 32-33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks . accelerated hypofractionation: 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks . continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART): 54 Gy in 36 fractions over 12 consecutive days . CHART shortens the overall treatment time but delivers three treatment fractions per day . Its implementation has been hampered by resource considerations and lack of evidence of superiority to contemporary radiation doses which are typically greater than 64 Gy . Side effects are predominantly lung related (Table 4.1) . Lung toxicity manifests as pneumonitis or inflammation in the lung (less than 6 months), usually presenting as a cough or dyspnea . Myelitis is rare . The fraction sizes are typically greater than 8 Gy per fraction . Methods of delivery are shown in Table 4.2 . It has been estimated that a dose greater than 84 Gy is needed to provide 50% tumor control at 3 years . A meta-analysis in stage I patients has confirmed equivalent survival to surgery at 2 years . The indications for SBRT over other radiotherapy techniques are shown in Table 4.3 and Figure 4.2 . Patients can be treated without histological confirmation if there is consensus at multidisciplinary meetings that the radiologically evident tumor shows incremental growth and abnormal PET avidity . Radical radiotherapy with chemotherapy . The sequential versus concurrent approach gives 5-year survival rates of 18% vs 23%, respectively . Dose intensification . The CHART regimen of hyperfractionated accelerated treatment has shown a survival benefit over standard radical radiotherapy delivery . This hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen, widely used in the UK, will form the basis of the control arm in the upcoming UK ADSCAN trial, which will assess dose intensification in sequential chemoradiation . Postoperative radiotherapy . A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials over 30 years found a 7% decrease in survival (48% vs 55%, p <0.001) when PORT was administered . This was attributed to cardiovascular and respiratory toxicity . An update in 2005 found no adverse effect in pN2 disease . The role of contemporary PORT in N2 disease is being assessed in the European LungART trial . Palliative radiotherapy . Radiotherapy provides effective palliation of symptomatic advanced intrathoracic disease and metastases . Three randomized trials conducted by the UK's Medical Research Council (MRC) have assessed fractionation for palliation of intrathoracic symptoms . Even when a single fraction is used, radiotherapy can produce complete resolution of symptoms in around 50% of cases . A dose of 36 Gy in 12 fractions is below spinal cord tolerance and therefore widely used as a safer alternative . 
What is addiction? . Drug addiction used to be thought of as a biological need for a drug that arises because of physiological adaptation to the presence of the drug in the body . The body becomes 'dependent' on the drug to be able to function normally . This 'physical dependence' model of addiction is no longer considered complete . However, in the great majority of cases, the addict returns to drug use later . There are almost certainly several mechanisms underlying smoking addiction, all involving nicotine in some way . One likely mechanism involves the development of a powerful 'habit' in which cues associated with smoking trigger an urge to smoke . Thus, smokers experience urges to smoke when confronted with smoking cues, but these need not stem from any anticipated pleasure from smoking or conscious decision-making process . At higher levels it is persistent and insistent, trying in some sense to motivate the smoker to do something to relieve it . It is a need . Thus, nicotine does not alleviate these problems in people who do not smoke . This means that smokers learn to associate adverse mood states and difficulty concentrating with smoking, and come to believe that smoking helps them to cope, even though it does so only because they are experiencing the problem because they have not smoked for a while . Unfortunately, as long as they believe that smoking helps to relieve adverse mood and other symptoms, smokers will be at risk of relapse when they try to stop . The sum of motivations . Different smokers probably experience each of these three elements of nicotine dependence to differing degrees . For some smokers the nicotine withdrawal syndrome is relatively mild, while others experience severe adverse mood states when not smoking . Of course, there is more to smoking than this: enjoyment of smoking, social rewards and attachment to the 'smoker identity' all play some role (Figure 5.2) . Recognizing an addicted smoker . Most smokers encountered by clinicians can be assumed to be addicted to some degree . Addicted smokers can be recognized or diagnosed in several ways . A simple indicator of dependence is smoking soon after waking . Natural history of quitting . Research shows, however, that smokers who smoke at all, even a puff, are extremely likely to relapse completely . This makes it imperative that smokers avoid any smoking, no matter how minor . Lapses are more likely when the smoker has been drinking, because smoking is associated with drinking and possibly because alcohol intoxication may undermine resolve . Exposure to other smokers or other smoking cues . The sight and smell of smoking naturally prompts craving, and proximity to smokers means cigarettes are readily available . It is therefore vital that smokers who are planning to quit anticipate these challenges and prepare coping strategies to deal with them . An unsuccessful attempt to quit does not doom a smoker to repeated failure . Most smokers are unhappy about their smoking and want to stop; in the USA and the UK, about 40% report having tried to stop in the past year . Contrary to what is popularly believed, younger smokers are more motivated to stop and try to stop more often than older smokers . Perhaps surprisingly, these seem less likely to succeed than when smokers take the plunge and stop in one go . What is more, these quit attempts are just as likely to succeed as ones that are planned in advance . the phase leading up to the quit attempt . the phase after the quit attempt has started . The phase leading up to the quit attempt is one in which a smoker struggles with the conflict between the knowledge of the harm that smoking does and continuing to smoke . A smoker experiences episodes of discomfort about his or her smoking when prompted to think about its harmful effects, excessive cost and feelings of stigma and so forth . At any one moment, the balance between the forces motivating restraint and the motivations to smoke determines whether the would-be ex-smoker accepts the offer of a cigarette, goes out and buys a packet of cigarettes or engages in some other activity that leads to smoking . It is not just passive motivation that determines the outcome at such critical moments . When faced with a temptation to smoke, and if equipped with adequate motivation to avoid smoking, smokers can actively cope with the urge in order to avoid smoking . If the would-be ex-smoker does smoke a cigarette in response to the immediate urge or need to smoke, usually he or she does not immediately abandon the quit attempt . Even after the quit attempt is abandoned, it can take weeks or even months before the previous pattern of smoking is re-established, and the smoker usually retains an interest in stopping at a future time point . 
Several of these symptoms are now recognized as possible prodromal features of Parkinson's disease . A mouse model suggesting a gastrointestinal route for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has also been reported . The cause of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease is unknown . excitotoxin- and xenobiotic-related cell death . Many studies have found complex 1 defects in patients with Parkinson's disease . Nigral cell loss . Additionally, microglial proliferation has been found postmortem in people with Parkinson's disease, suggesting ongoing neuronal death . In a 2-year study, 10% of these high-risk individuals showed deterioration in dopaminergic markers, and some developed clinical disease . A large study (the Parkinson's Associated Risk Study [PARS]), involving 7500 relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease, is under way to confirm these findings . While this model explains many of the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, there are several inconsistencies . The aging process is intricately related to the development of Parkinson's disease but is not solely responsible, as some patients develop the disease early in life . Furthermore, the type of dopamine-cell loss in normal aging differs from that in Parkinson's disease . Certain personality traits and environmental factors may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease developing . People with a family history of Parkinson's disease are also at higher risk of developing the disease (see Genetics, pages 31 -) . Welding-related parkinsonism . To date, the mechanisms by which genetic changes alter the risk of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood . Genetic investigation of Parkinson's disease is complicated by the same factors that influence the study of its epidemiology . The familial patterns of Parkinson's disease can be masked if affected family members die before clinical signs become apparent . Despite these limitations, significant progress has been made in our understanding of the genetics of the disease from familial aggregation studies, examination of large kindreds and studies in twins . Familial risk . Individuals with a positive family history have twice the risk of developing Parkinson's disease symptoms . The risk for siblings is increased significantly if there is an affected sibling with young-onset Parkinson's disease . The risk increases further to 12-24% if both a sibling and a parent are affected . Large kindred studies . Several families with Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism have been described . A landmark study, initially reported by Golbe et al . However, the SNCA and PARK3 mutations have not been found in many families with autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease or sporadic Parkinson's disease . The same genetic mutation has been found in European families in individuals with juvenile or young-onset Parkinson's disease . Studies in twins have been performed since 1967 . However, Parkinson's disease may be asymptomatic in the unaffected twin . studied 18-fluorodopa PET scans in sets of twins in which one of each pair had clinical Parkinson's disease . Therefore, it seems that some genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease is likely . A widely accepted approximate figure for the prevalence of Parkinson's disease is 200 per 100 000 individuals . Parkinson's disease has been found in all the ethnic populations studied; however, sporadic reports suggest that patterns of parkinsonism may differ between different ethnic groups . However, this is not widely accepted . Of more than 20 reports on Parkinson's disease and mortality, 11 reported mortality increases of 1.5-twofold, while the others reported increases greater than twofold . Several researchers have suggested that disability and mortality in Parkinson's disease show a sex difference, with significantly greater mortality in women . However, there are other studies suggesting a poorer prognosis in men . Berger reported relative risks of death of 3.1 for men and 1.8 for women with the disease, although these figures are much higher than those reported in other studies . A study by Japanese investigators suggested a mean age at death of 71.9 years in men and 74.2 years for women . In general, before the use of levodopa the relative risk of death with Parkinson's disease was about 3.0 . The confusion regarding mortality in Parkinson's disease may be partly because the disease itself is not a primary or direct cause of death . The cause of death in Parkinson's disease is most commonly a secondary comorbid disorder . A Japanese study showed that the most common cause of death for all patients, regardless of age, was pneumonia . 
Normal neuromuscular transmission . The high concentration of AChRs is crucial for efficient neuromuscular transmission . The ACh depolarizes the muscle endplate region, ultimately causing the muscle to contract (Figure 2.1) . Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the best characterized autoimmune disorder of the nervous system . The immune-mediated nature of MG was suspected as early as the 1960s when it was speculated to be caused by a dysregulated immune response, with antibodies directed against skeletal muscle . Acetylcholine receptor antibodies . Loss of AChRs results in impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness . Multiple pathological processes cause loss of functional AChRs in MG . complement-mediated lysis . accelerated internalization and degradation of AChRs . direct blockade of AChRs by antibodies . Complement-mediated lysis is thought to be the most important mode of loss of AChR, but the actual process that initiates the aberrant immune attack on the AChR is unknown . This results in lysis of the postsynaptic membrane, causing loss of the AChR (Figure 2.2) . In fact, elevated MAC levels have been demonstrated in the plasma of patients with MG . Accelerated internalization and degradation of acetylcholine receptors . This process is known as antigenic modulation . Direct blockade of acetylcholine receptors by antibodies . These antibodies block the binding of ACh to AChRs on the muscle endplate (Figure 2.4) . Impaired neuromuscular transmission . Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies . At present it is unclear how MuSK antibodies cause MG, but it is possible that MuSK antibodies alter AChR density or number . MuSK signaling is crucial for the development, long-term maintenance and stabilization of the postsynaptic portion of the NMJ . The antibodies in MuSK MG are largely of the IgG4 subclass and have been demonstrated in vitro to block the assembly and activation of MuSK . In animal models, administration of MuSK antibodies has resulted in reduced postsynaptic AChRs, disturbed synaptic alignment, reduced synaptic potentials and impaired muscle activation . Role of the thymus . Approximately 75% of patients who undergo thymectomy are found to have thymic pathology . Of these, 15% are discovered to have thymoma, and the remainder have evidence of lymphoid hyperplasia . MG can be classified in a variety of ways . by disease type . by antibody status . by disease severity . Classification by disease type . Classification by antibody status . Antibodies to AChR . As noted above, MG is most often caused by antibodies to the AChR . Antibodies to AChR may be of the binding, blocking or modulating type, with binding being the most common . Antibody titers may decline with immunosuppressive treatment within an individual, although the reliability of determining treatment effect is less robust . There is predominant involvement of the bulbar muscles, often with concurrent neck and respiratory muscle weakness . Ocular and limb muscle weakness is less common than in AChR-antibody-related disease but is certainly seen in this population . Most patients can actually worsen on treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine . Seronegative for AChR or MuSK antibodies . Other antibodies . Classification by disease severity . The most commonly used modification of the original classification scheme is as follows . Group I - ocular . Group IIA - mild generalized . Group IIB - moderate-to-severe generalized . Group III - acute, severe, developing over weeks to months . Group IV - late, severe, with marked bulbar involvement . This classification has several notable limitations, including the indistinct descriptive wording and lack of clear distinctions between groups . This classification system also fails to include a category for patients in clinical remission or those in crisis . A task force of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) subsequently developed a refined classification system (Table 2.1) that is more clinically descriptive and provides a clearer distinction between groups . 
The presentation of patients with glioblastoma overlaps with a range of other conditions . Histological diagnosis of glioblastoma is therefore mandatory and is usually obtained through stereotactic biopsy or after tumor resection . Morphological features . The initial step in the diagnosis of glioblastoma is morphological assessment of the tumor . High-grade gliomas are highly cellular, with varied nuclear morphology (Figure 3.1; also see Figure 1.3) . The matrix of these tumors is fibrillary, formed by processes of tumor cells and often involving underlying central nervous system (CNS) tissue that is overrun by tumor cells . A further characteristic feature of high-grade gliomas is the presence of necrotic tumor cells of varying form and shape . Palisading necrosis is typical in glioblastoma, but larger areas of sharply demarcated necrotic tumor are also commonly seen . When assessing gliomas, it must be borne in mind that some tumors with the molecular profile of a glioblastoma (see below) may not have all high-grade features . It is increasingly apparent that diffuse infiltrating gliomas may not have high-grade features when diagnosed early . Likewise, the histone H3.3 K27M-mutant gliomas may not have any histological high-grade features but are defined as WHO grade IV . Some tumors can be robustly diagnosed with these antibodies alone, particularly tumors with IDH and ATRX mutations and H3.3 K27M mutated tumors . Other markers . Many high-grade gliomas can be classified by a selection of the markers described above . This chapter focuses on the diagnostic use of imaging in patients with suspected glioma/glioblastoma . The role of imaging in the management of patients with glioblastoma is discussed in Chapter 4 . Computed tomography has a low soft tissue contrast, therefore its role in diagnosing glioma is limited . CT is commonly the first imaging test to be carried out when patients newly present with symptoms of glioblastoma; it is often sufficient to exclude the need for immediate neurosurgical intervention . Anatomic magnetic resonance imaging . All patients with suspected or confirmed glioblastoma should have an MRI scan . T2-weighted and FLAIR images are most valuable for estimating macroscopic tumor boundaries: FLAIR increases the overall contrast between the tumor and normal brain tissue, and may thus facilitate lesion detection, while the loss of grey-white matter detail, indicative of tumor, is well delineated on T2 images . For this reason, T2 imaging should always be reviewed when assessing the extent of glioma infiltration . Microscopic tumor infiltration, which is a typical feature of glioblastoma, remains occult on anatomic MRI . Similarly, imaging cannot reliably differentiate between peritumoral edema and infiltration . Numerous anatomic imaging features have been explored as biomarkers of glioma subtype, specifically glioblastoma . Distant metastases, however, are virtually non-existent, so staging can be achieved from brain imaging only . Structural features on imaging, particularly calcification, and younger patient age can support the identification of oligodendrogliomas (Figure 3.4) . DWI (b1000) and ADC must be interpreted in conjunction and are often assessed qualitatively in clinical practice by reporting the presence or absence of restricted diffusion as a tumor feature . In general, diffusion decreases as tissue cellularity increases . This feature can occur in glioblastoma, but malignant gliomas are more likely to exhibit diffusion values similar to or slightly greater than normal brain tissue . Other diffusion techniques . N -acetyl aspartate is the principal marker of neuronal integrity, which non-specifically decreases in glioblastoma . Lactate is not present in normal tissues, but accumulates in rapidly proliferating tumors as an effect of tissue hypoxia (Figure 3.7) . Lipids are markers of necrosis, which can also (non-specifically) increase in glioblastoma . MRS has limited accuracy for glioma grading and is preferentially used to distinguish tumors from non-neoplastic conditions . For this reason, FDG is not widely used in clinical glioma imaging . PET imaging is rarely indicated in clinical practice for untreated glioma characterization . 
Etiology and pathogenesis . pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors . pancreatic lymphoma . metastatic tumors . adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater . intrapancreatic bile duct adenocarcinoma . duodenal adenocarcinoma . The KRAS oncogene is frequently altered in pancreatic adenocarcinomas . Epidemiology and risk factors . Worldwide there are approximately 250 000 new cases each year: 70 000 in Europe and 32 000 in the USA . Tobacco smoking is the major risk factor . The second most important risk factor is a familial background (5-10%) . Peutz-Jeghers syndrome . familial breast and ovarian cancer . familial atypical multiple mole melanoma . hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer . ataxia telangiectasia . Li-Fraumeni syndrome . familial adenomatous polyposis . cystic fibrosis . There is also an association with diabetes mellitus, especially in older patients . Functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have their own particular modes of presentation (see Chapter 12) . Laboratory tests . Blood tests should be carried out for anemia, clotting profile, proteins and liver function . It can be elevated in benign disease and in the presence of obstructive jaundice or chronic pancreatitis . Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are relatively hypovascular, whereas neuroendocrine tumors are hypervascular . Transabdominal ultrasonography should be undertaken as an initial first step . Enlargement of lymph nodes per se is a poor prognostic indicator . CT may be supplemented by EUS, MRI and laparoscopy . Differential diagnosis . Secondary screening . Palliative treatment . Once the diagnosis is made or strongly suspected, the next objective is to stage the disease . If resection is not possible then non-surgical treatment should be undertaken . Stenting of the obstructed biliary tree . ERCP is the preferred method for drainage and stenting of an obstructed biliary tree to relieve jaundice . The stent is retrogradely inserted through the biliary stricture; expandable metallic stents are preferable . EUS-guided biliary drainage has also become a viable option for failed biliary drainage via ERCP . Surgical bypass . In younger, fitter patients, biliary bypass may be preferred as blockage of stents is avoided . Pain relief is not easy . Enzyme supplements are essential, as the main pancreatic duct is usually blocked, leading to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency . Further options include gemcitabine and erlotinib (an epidermal growth factor inhibitor) or capecitabine . Many trials are under way to find chemotherapy treatments that will improve survival . Radiotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy may be helpful in controlling pain in patients with locally advanced disease . However, it is not clear if survival is better than with chemotherapy alone . This approach is not universally adopted at this time . Curative surgical treatment . Preoperative biliary drainage may be used before surgery to relieve jaundice in cases with cholangitis and fever . There is increasing evidence of the benefit of neoadjuvant therapy in borderline resectable patients . A number of different types of surgery have been described . Total pancreatectomy is reserved for large tumors . Adjuvant treatment . Metastatic sites may also be palliated with radiotherapy . Future trends . Improved methods for early diagnosis to improve survival in this very lethal cancer . Improved chemotherapy regimens to improve survival in locally advanced and metastatic patients . Centralization of treatment in reference centers with multidisciplinary teams . Use of PET in conjunction with CT/MRI (fusion PET-CT/MRI) . This is an evolving technique that measures the metabolism in tumor cells . Novel biological therapies and cancer vaccination . Anticachexia drugs . Improved methods of pain control . 
Because of past harms associated with research involving human participants, there is an expectation and, in many cases, a regulatory requirement that an ethics committee review will take place in advance of the research commencing . These regulations were initiated in 1974 as part of the National Research Act . In the US, an IRB is required to have a minimum of five people, including scientists, non-scientists and someone who is unaffiliated with the organization . The IRB is responsible for reviewing research that involves human participants to evaluate compliance with federal regulations and application of ethical principles . The IRB also reviews the proposed research to make sure that participants selected to participate represent those most likely to benefit from its results . Moreover, the IRB wants to make sure that people who are invited to participate in research have a good understanding of the study purpose and what they will be asked to do . This process of sharing study information with a prospective participant is called informed consent and is a central tenet of biomedical research . Federal regulations and accepted ethical principles are in place to guide the conduct of research so that the science is rigorous and the participants are protected . In any research, an important step is to determine if people involved in the testing phase are considered to be human participants in the research . The federal regulations include definitions for what qualifies as 'research' and 'human subject' and address the responsibilities of the organization and research team . The IRB review and approval are usually needed if the activity is considered to be research and the people involved with testing meet the definition of a human subject (exempli gratia clinical or non-clinical research) . IRB review criteria and pathways . exempt from the Common Rule . expedited review . Exempt from the Common Rule . When a study is exempt, it means that the Common Rule does not apply to the research . Normally, the IRB decides whether a study meets the criteria for exemption, expedited or full committee review . Expedited review . However, studies that are designed to carry out safety and efficacy testing of a medical device are probably not eligible for an expedited review and will be reviewed by a convened gathering of IRB members . The only difference between an expedited and convened committee review is the number of people involved in evaluating the research plan . An expedited review can be conducted by a subset of the IRB membership, which is usually the IRB chair and one other member . Any study that does not qualify for exempt or expedited review is evaluated by a convened group of IRB members . For research covered by the Common Rule, documentation of informed consent is required, though this may be waived . IRB application . Once the type of review is known, an IRB application is developed by the research team that includes a detailed research protocol and a draft of the informed consent document . The protocol will briefly describe the scientific literature that the study is building from, as well as the study aims, procedures, participant inclusion criteria, risks, benefits, risk management, data management, investigator qualifications and informed consent details . The IRB will review this protocol application to evaluate whether the risks are appropriate in relation to the potential contribution to science and benefits to people like those who participate in the study . Application of ethical principles . Researchers have applied these principles and relied on IRBs to help shape ethical research practices for nearly half a century . While IRB approval is an important step in the process for identifying and mitigating risk in studies, it is truly the responsibility of developers, researchers and clinicians to be a part of the ethical decision-making process . Launched in 2015 at the University of California, San Diego, USA, the CORE initiative is a learning 'ethics' resource developed to support the digital medicine research community, including researchers and IRBs . The checklist prompts researchers to think about ethics, privacy, risks and benefits, access and usability, and data management (see) (Figure 5.2) . In addition, technology companies are increasingly involved in biomedical research . The MobileELSI project will develop recommendations to guide the conduct of unregulated digital medicine research . Ethics when an IRB review is not required . When research involves retrospective analysis of existing data or prospective observation, testing or experimenting with people to generate 'generalizable' knowledge, an IRB review is needed . However, those involved decided to publish the study results to share knowledge produced with the public . In this case, though, many users were outraged about being involved in research that they did not consent to . 
Involvement of a supportive care team including specialist nursing care is also mandatory in the palliative setting . News of a poor prognosis can be difficult to process initially . Patients need time to ask questions and receive honest answers . Surgery is the initial therapeutic approach for tumor debulking and to obtain tissue for diagnosis . The aim of surgery is maximum tumor resection while maintaining neurological function . Risk versus benefit . If surgical resection is not safe because of the tumor location or impaired performance status, a biopsy should be obtained if feasible . Surgical planning . MRI helps to estimate the operability of tumors and facilitates surgical planning . High-resolution 3D volumetric imaging sequences can help to assess tumor resectability and the optimal operative trajectory . Anatomic MRI can be integrated into surgical navigation software, where appropriate, together with functional and tractography sequences . Functional MRI (fMRI) measures dynamic blood oxygen level-dependent variations in brain activity . Most commonly, fMRI can assess language lateralization or motor cortical activation in relation to the tumor . These multidirectional data enable both the volume and the directionality of diffusion to be calculated . DTI tractography provides an approximation of the relations between the most eloquent white matter tracts and the tumor . More recently, it has been shown that IDH -mutant astrocytomas in particular benefit from near-complete resection . Postoperative care . Further imaging will confirm the extent of surgical resection . Furthermore, CT is useful for identifying and/or monitoring development of hydrocephalus . Anticonvulsants and steroids should be prescribed and tapered according to the patient's clinical status . Patients are usually advised to restrict the level of exercise in the immediate days after they leave hospital . This treatment is not usually administered until about 4 weeks after surgery when the craniotomy wound has healed . Doses above this are associated with increased toxicity with no additional survival benefit . Because of its small size and lipophilic properties, it can cross the blood-brain barrier . Temozolomide is administered orally at 75 mg/m daily during radiotherapy . Temozolomide acts by preventing DNA replication through alkyl group-mediated crosslinking of DNA . Clinical data . Survival did not plateau in the EORTC-NCIC CE3 study . However, there was no significant improvement in OS . Thus, six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide remains the standard of care . Managing treatment-related adverse events . Cytopenias, pneumonitis and opportunistic infections have also been reported . Prognostic factors . MGMT methylation status . At present, clinicians form their own opinions as to how to apply this in clinical practice . Follow-up . Serial magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred method of response assessment and long-term monitoring after surgery and/or adjuvant therapy . This process of imaging is fraught with complexity . Serial tumor measurements can vary according to scan angle and slice selection . A problematic issue is the overlap that exists between structural and advanced imaging features of viable tumor and necrotic tissue . However, several advanced imaging techniques are valuable in this context . However, overlap in diffusivity values and movement of tumor structures over time can hamper serial diffusion measurements in clinical practice . Other follow-up tests . Tumor recurrence after initial standard of care therapy is virtually inevitable . Surgery may be considered, particularly if the tumor exerts a mass effect . Repeat radiotherapy may be considered for recurrent small tumors, although there is a lack of prospective comparative trials . The evidence supporting use of stereotactic radiotherapy in the recurrent setting is minimal . Median OS was 13 months in the intent-to-treat population . Antiangiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab rapidly restore the blood-brain barrier . Despite the presence of viable tumor, this may markedly reduce lesion contrast enhancement on MRI ('pseudoresponse') . Palliative care . Mood and cognitive disturbances are also common . Improving quality of life at all stages of the disease is an important goal for the multidisciplinary team . Access to speech therapy and physical rehabilitation are also important . Elderly patients . 
Prevention versus treatment . Current therapy of osteoarthritis (OA) largely aims to treat existing disease by controlling its major symptom - pain - and maintain or improve joint and limb function and improve quality of life . While there are numerous therapies targeted against symptoms, at present no treatments have been definitively shown to modify the structural progression of OA . Currently, the best advice we can give on preventing OA relates to the following lifestyle modifications . avoid joint trauma . A healthy diet is important to aid weight control, but no diets or dietary supplements have been shown to prevent, or to modify the progression of, OA . Management of OA . There are many evidence-based guidelines from a variety of specialty societies for managing OA (see Key references, page 72) . These guidelines agree on several main principles for the treatment of the disease . People with OA should be involved in their own management, and should receive education about their condition and the range and safety of treatment options available . Therapies, particularly pharmacological ones, need to be tailored according to an individual person's comorbidities and risk factors . Exercise and weight management should be recommended to all patients . Table 6.1 summarizes the hierarchy of options that should be considered for managing individuals with OA . Remember, none of these therapies is mutually exclusive and patients who are not responding should be offered as many options as possible before surgery is considered . Therapies will need to be tailored according to an individual patient's comorbidities and preferences . intra-articular therapy, particularly intra-articular hyaluronans (see Chapter 9) . Very importantly, we should not confuse what clinicians advise or prescribe with how patients manage their own OA . There is little research on what patients actually do, but certainly compliance, perhaps more so with self-directed therapies, such as exercise, is often low . Clinicians therefore need to adapt the consultation to the needs of the individual patient to reach agreement on a suitable and sustainable management plan . The subsequent chapters give an overview of the rationale, evidence and clinical hints for using a particular therapy . Problems with interpreting the OA therapy literature . The practicing clinician may well be overwhelmed at times with the number of publications on a given therapy . However, some critical analysis of trial data is important . Some of the common problems in interpreting OA trials include . the use of different definitions (exempli gratia of OA) . the use of different outcome measures . the degree of clinical significance . Different definitions . Studies use different definitions of OA, focusing on symptoms, clinical features, radiographic findings, or a combination of these . For example, many studies of knee OA do not evaluate the patellofemoral joint, which is a common site of pain in OA of the knee, and few studies consider multiple joint involvement . Use of different outcome measures . The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Core Set (OMERACT) for OA recommends collecting data on pain, function and quality of life; however, there are many instruments for measuring these domains, and they have different performance metrics . As these tools may be used as averaged daily measures or at single time points, care needs to be taken when comparing studies . Most trials (of drugs in particular) tend to include relatively healthy patients and do not reflect the usual older OA population with a high frequency of comorbidities . In addition, trial participants may have only one painful joint, whereas large community samples suggest that, in practice, patients over 55 years of age may have an average of four painful joints . Degree of clinical significance . Many studies have reported a statistically significant difference between two trial therapies without reporting whether the result is important clinically . This may sometimes be expressed as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) . The MCID may vary depending on the measure used to estimate a patient's symptoms . Although the reader should look at specific data for individual outcome measures, in general, a treatment effect of at least 20% is desirable . Structured care pathways . With the massive rise of symptomatic OA due to the aging 'baby boomer' population and the increasing prevalence of obesity, healthcare systems are being placed under increasing stress to manage OA . Certainly, public and private systems will increasingly look at the structure and cost-effectiveness of OA care regimens . 
Most myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic conditions that remain clinically stable for many years; however, the condition may progress to acute leukemia in a minority of patients, referred to as MPN blast phase (MPN-BP) . This transformation most commonly occurs in patients with myelofibrosis, in whom transformation rates of 15-30% have been reported, compared with 1-4% for patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 4-9% for those with polycythemia vera (PV) . Typically, patients with ET or PV initially develop post-ET or post-PV myelofibrosis, which may subsequently undergo transformation to MPN-BP, although in rare cases these conditions may transform directly into MPN-BP without an intermediate myelofibrotic stage . Risk factors for the development of MPN-BP include leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and unfavorable karyotype (Table 9.1) . There are no specific diagnostic criteria for MPN-BP . The principal criterion is the same as for de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML): more than 20% blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood . Persistence is also important if only peripheral blood blasts are considered . Importantly, acceleration or progression of myelofibrosis is usually apparent before the development of overt leukemia . progressive and resistant splenomegaly . increasing numbers of blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood . In addition, recent evidence suggests that progression during treatment with Janus kinase inhibitors is associated with a risk of MPN-BP . MPN-BP is associated with a poor prognosis: median survival is 2-6 months, although this may be prolonged by intensive treatment and prompt recourse to stem cell transplantation (SCT) . There is no standard of care for MPN-BP, and many of the current treatment regimens (Table 9.2) are derived from experience in AML . Induction chemotherapy and SCT . In general, MPN-BP should only be treated with induction chemotherapy when allogeneic SCT is planned in eligible patients . The induction chemotherapy regimens are the same as those used in AML, and response rates are similar to those seen in poor-risk AML patients: typically, complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rates are 40-50%, although rates of approximately 70% have been reported with a combination of cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline . However, these responses are not durable, having a median duration of approximately 5 months . Eligible patients should therefore undergo SCT as soon as possible . The importance of this is highlighted by a study in which median overall survival in patients who completed allogeneic SCT following CR/CRi with induction chemotherapy was 47 months, compared with 9.4 months in those who achieved a CR/CRi but did not go on to SCT . Two-year overall survival rates were 47% and 17%, respectively . Achieving a CR is essential for successful SCT . In one study, 8 of 13 patients proceeded to SCT after induction chemotherapy and were followed for a median of 20 months . All five who achieved CR had returned to chronic MPN at the time of SCT but remained in remission, whereas 2 of 3 patients with persistent marrow or circulating blasts died . Patients with MPN-BP who are not eligible for induction chemotherapy or SCT may benefit from treatment with hypomethylating agents . In one study involving 54 patients with MPN-BP or a condition suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome, treatment with azacitidine resulted in an overall response rate (CR + CRi + partial response) of 28% after a median of 20 months' follow-up, and median overall survival was 8 months in the MPN-BP group . However, support for this approach currently comes mainly from small case series . 
Although there is a trend towards earlier detection of prostate cancer, many men worldwide still present with widespread metastatic disease . In contrast to localized or locally advanced disease, metastatic prostate cancer is associated with high mortality - approximately 70% within 5 years . Bilateral orchidectomy or bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy is performed through a midline scrotal incision (Figure 7.1) under local, regional or light general anesthesia . The procedure is simple and is associated with little morbidity . Clinical responses (decreased bone pain and reduced PSA concentration) are obtained in more than 75% of patients . LHRH analogs . These agents can be delivered via 1-, 3- or 6-monthly depot preparations, administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly . This may result in increased bone pain or worsening symptoms of bladder outflow or ureteric obstruction; spinal metastases may also be stimulated to expand, increasing the risk of spinal cord compression . However, the reduction in testosterone may induce features of the metabolic syndrome (see page 126) and reduce bone mineral density (BMD; see page 125) . LHRH antagonists . PSA decrease was rapid in both cases and was maintained in the long term . LHRH antagonists are particularly beneficial for patients with bony metastases, spinal cord compression or bladder neck obstruction, for whom rapid tumor control without testosterone surge is important . Recently, it has been suggested that LHRH antagonists carry a lower risk of cardiovascular side effects than the LHRH analogs, possibly because they maintain consistently low testosterone levels . Antiandrogens (taken in tablet form) do not alter the levels of circulating androgens . Instead, they inhibit the androgen receptor where testosterone or DHT binds . They may be steroidal or non-steroidal . Maximal androgen blockade . Androgen-independent cancer cell clones are selected out, and the mean time to tumor progression is less than 18 months and mean overall survival (OS) is 28-36 months . Persistent adrenal androgen secretion may contribute to this poor prognosis; there is evidence that adrenal androgens account for up to 15-20% of total androgen concentrations within the prostate . In addition, maximal androgen blockade may offer a slight advantage over monotherapy in a subgroup of patients with good performance status (id est those who are generally well) and a relatively restricted metastatic burden . Such treatment should therefore be considered in younger and fitter patients who are more likely to die from the prostate cancer rather than from a comorbid condition . However, the relatively modest benefits need to be weighed against the increased costs and the small but significant incidence in side effects from the antiandrogens . The timing of hormonal therapy . The appropriate timing of hormonal therapy has been the subject of vigorous debate and the evidence now favors earlier therapy rather than waiting for symptoms . It is clear that early initiation of hormone therapy in men with locally advanced or metastatic disease improves survival and decreases complications . It should be borne in mind, however, that earlier treatment with hormonal therapy increases the risk of side effects such as osteoporosis . Intermittent hormonal therapy . In this approach, hormone therapy is initially given for 6-9 months . If PSA levels become normalized, the LHRH analog/antagonist is temporarily discontinued . Such a regimen allows serum testosterone to return to normal, thereby stimulating atrophic cells and rendering them more sensitive to androgen ablation (Figure 7.4) . Two randomized trials have compared intermittent versus continuous treatment in men with advanced prostate cancer . Management of the adverse effects of ADT is described in Chapter 9 . Androgen deprivation in combination with chemotherapy . Men who had a high volume of metastases seemed to benefit the most . Spinal cord compression and pathological fractures . Spinal cord compression due to pathological fracture or collapse of the lumbar vertebrae is the most common reason for these symptoms (Figure 7.5) . The diagnosis may be confirmed by urgent spinal MRI . Early neurosurgical decompression is often advised, usually followed by external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and corticosteroids . Pathological fractures caused by prostate cancer metastases may also occur elsewhere, such as in the femur or humerus . Fixation by an orthopedic specialist is often required and should usually be followed by EBRT and androgen ablation . 
Conventional antiemetics are more successful at preventing emesis than nausea . Current data from multiple large studies suggest that neither first- nor second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT) receptor antagonists (RAs) are effective in the control of nausea in patients receiving either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC or HEC, respectively), despite marked improvement in the control of emesis . Multiple large phase III trials have also shown that although the neurokinin (NK)-1 RA aprepitant is effective for the control of emesis, it is not effective in controling nausea in patients receiving MEC or HEC . Similarly, phase III clinical trial data indicate that the new neurokinin (NK)-1 RAs netupitant and rolapitant are not effective antinausea agents,, although rolapitant may have some effect in patients receiving cisplatin HEC . These studies suggest that the serotonin (5-HT) and substance P (NK-1) receptors may not be important in the mediation of nausea, despite their important role in chemotherapy-induced emesis (see page 11) . New studies using novel agents and using nausea as the primary endpoint need to be performed . Olanzapine appears to have high potential for the control of both emesis and nausea in patients receiving MEC or HEC (Table 6.1) . Phase III studies suggest that olanzapine may be an important agent in the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea . Olanzapine is known to affect a wide variety of receptors including dopamine D, 5-HT 2C, histaminic and muscarinic receptors . At present, there is still a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced nausea, and any or all of these receptors may be important mediators . The addition of olanzapine to the 5-HT RA azasetron and dexamethasone has been shown to improve nausea and emesis compared with azasetron and dexamethasone alone in patients receiving MEC and HEC . Olanzapine, palonosetron and dexamethasone has been shown to improve the control of nausea compared with aprepitant, palonosetron and dexamethasone in patients receiving HEC . Breakthrough nausea and emesis was controlled with olanzapine in patients receiving HEC and guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics . The addition of olanzapine to aprepitant, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone significantly improved nausea and emesis compared with aprepitant, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone alone in patients receiving HEC . Olanzapine is available as a generic . Other agents . Preliminary small studies with gabapentin have demonstrated some effectiveness in the control of chemotherapy-induced emesis, but the control of nausea has yet to be determined . More studies with the use of cannabinoids need to be performed before it is known whether this class of agent is clinically efficacious in the control of CINV . The studies performed to date do not support the use of ginger as an effective agent in the prevention of CINV . Few randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of non-pharmacological measures to prevent or treat chemotherapy-induced nausea . Table 6.2 summarizes measures suggested by case reports . 
Acne vulgaris is the most common type of acne . non-inflammatory lesions . inflammatory lesions . Microcomedones, the precursors of all acne lesions, may develop into whiteheads or blackheads . Patients may think that these resolving lesions are active acne lesions and may have the erroneous impression that their acne is not improving . It is important to reassure patients that these dark areas are healing lesions and not active acne . Other forms of acne . acnes) only . Acne with solid facial edema . Adult female acne . Adult acne, particularly in women, is worthy of special note; many adults have a prolonged course of acne beyond teenage years and in some cases acne may present for the first time in adulthood . Although it is generally less severe than teenage acne, acne in adult women is challenging to treat . If an adult woman has sudden-onset severe acne, acne accompanied by signs of hyperandrogenism or acne that is refractory to conventional therapy, a medical history and physical examination directed towards eliciting symptoms or signs of hyperandrogenism should be performed . Acne excoriée (also known as acne excorie or 'acne de jeune filles') is described on pages 46-7 . Acne mechanica . Repetitive rubbing or friction can sometimes exacerbate acne . Acne mechanica tends to occur in cases of moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne and less often in cases of mild acne . Treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying acne and minimizing the mechanical stress on the skin . Occupational acne . Exposure to certain industrial agents can lead to the development of acne . Drug-induced acne . A number of drugs cause or worsen acne or can induce an acneiform eruption (Table 3.5) . In contrast, most drug-induced 'acnes' represent acne-like eruptions embracing monomorphic inflammatory lesions in the absence of comedones, often presenting abruptly outside the most frequent age range for acne and extending over areas not commonly affected by acne . Lithium can worsen existing acne or cause acne de novo . The acne presents 2-3 months after starting therapy . Comedonal lesions are the most frequently seen lesions; inflammatory lesions are usually sparse . If 'acne' is triggered the drug should be withdrawn; response is variable and systemic therapy and physical treatment of the comedones may be required . Estimates suggest that acne is a side effect in as many as 43% of users . Acne may be exacerbated by progestins and has been reported with use of the Mirena coil . Exacerbation or new onset of acne have been described with vitamin B, 5-10 mg/week . Women are almost exclusively affected, with acne developing within the first 2 weeks after the injection . The acne-inducing dose of vitamin B has not been established . acnes cultures promoted the production of porphyrins, providing a potential mechanism of action, as porphyrins induce inflammation in acne . Conventional acne therapies are usually unsuccessful but the acneiform rash settles within 8-10 days of withdrawing the vitamin B therapy . The severity of the reaction also appears to correlate with the response to therapy . A drug-induced skin reaction occurs in more than 50% of patients, often within a few weeks of receiving therapy . Comedones are not seen . Most reports suggest that topical acne therapies, oral tetracyclines and topical or oral corticosteroids are effective . It often occurs in adult women, especially in the context of stress . Assessing acne severity . Defining acne severity helps with the selection of the most suitable initial therapy and enables response to treatment to be monitored . There are many scales available for assessing the severity of acne, but no consensus on a gold standard . Acne can be classified as comedonal, mild, moderate or severe based on the type of lesions (Table 3.6) . Alternatively, an assessment tool such as the Leeds Revised Acne Grading System allows grading of severity based on photographic comparisons of acne on the face (Figure 3.18), back and chest . Table 3.1 outlines the key elements in developing an accurate acne history . 
The same is true of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the spine . Duration of pain is an important characteristic . Importantly, the structure of the central nervous system has not been modified . When the injury has healed, the affected area returns to its usual status . These alterations result in increased sensitivity to painful stimuli . Psychological factors affecting pain . Back pain occurs in an individual with a combination of physical, social and emotional concerns . Back pain is, in the truest sense, psychosomatic . Anatomic structures involved in generating pain . The multifidus is the most medial . The gluteal and piriformis muscles are shown in Figure 3.1 . This is accompanied by a palpable localized region of deep, tender muscle induration . There are no negative consequences of this, however, unless unnecessary surgery is performed . These events occur when an individual lifts an object too heavy for the paraspinous muscles to support . The reflex signal from the brain tells the injured muscle to contract to facilitate healing . Simultaneously, reflex signals are sent to surrounding muscles to contract to protect the injured muscle . Treatment for muscle strain is gradual movement, NSAIDs and muscle relaxants . Other ligaments (Figure 3.3) are the following . The posterior longitudinal ligament, in contrast, is not attached to the vertebral body . In flexion, the anterior annular fibers are compressed and the posterior fibers stretched . The annulus and the facet joints share 80% of torsional stress . Healing of any injured tissue is a three-phase process . repair of the injured tissues . remodeling of the damaged tissue, to the extent that this is possible . A majority of individuals (80% or more) can resolve a disc herniation without surgical intervention . Over a number of months, the gel can be resorbed and the nerve returned to normal function . Non-surgical therapy can include NSAIDs, muscle relaxants and analgesics (see Chapter 4) . The lumbar spine supports the torso and permits flexion, lateral flexion and extension . The vertebrae slip over each other, and so the disc must also slip . grade 1: 25% or less slippage . grade 2: 25-50% slippage or overlap . grade 3: 50-75% overlap . grade 4: the superior vertebra almost completely or completely overrides the lower one . Other bone pathologies . They include . Sacroiliac joints . The bursae can be overloaded, however, and become inflamed . Bursal tenderness of the subgluteus-medius bursa is less common . The sensory fibers consist of . large, rapidly conducting type A fibers that transmit touch, pressure and proprioception . small unmyelinated type C pain-transmitting fibers . Spinal stenosis . Similar but unilateral symptoms may be caused by nerve root canal stenosis . The upright posture decreases volume in the spinal canal . Neurogenic claudication depends on time and posture, but not on activity or energy utilization . peripheral arteriosclerosis . current or previous sciatica . osteoarthritis of the hips or knees . peripheral neuropathies . Paget's disease . spinal cord tumors . Vascular components . Congenital and developmental abnormalities . In addition, it is not always congenitally fabricated properly, nor does it always develop correctly during growth . Ligaments, tendons and fascias . The universal assignment for the ligaments is to hold the various skeletal structures together . It is more common in females than in males . Spinal rigidity . Examination will reveal restricted movement and a flattened lumbar curve . Traumatic factors . Lumbar fractures are usually related to trauma and are quite straightforward to diagnose . See Fast Facts: Osteoporosis . Pain is typically brought on by sitting or changing position . Other pathologies . renal disorders, exempli gratia carcinoma or calculus . pancreatic disorders, exempli gratia tumor or pancreatitis . 
Long-term complications develop in virtually all patients taking continued levodopa therapy . disease severity . Table 7.1 shows the clinically most important indicators, both motor and non-motor, for defining advanced Parkinson's disease, and the functional impact those symptoms are likely to have on the patient . Initial treatment with levodopa will reverse parkinsonian symptoms consistently during the day without fluctuations . Established/unstable Parkinson's disease . Within 2-3 years, most patients begin to experience fluctuations (Table 7.2) . In advanced disease, the improvement in parkinsonism correlates with the level of levodopa in the bloodstream (Table 7.3) . Advanced disease . Fluctuations become increasingly unpredictable over a period of years and are difficult to relate to dopa dosage . 'On/off' syndrome becomes the focus of their lives and is a challenging problem for clinicians (Table 7.4) . Dyskinesias are hyperkinetic states mostly seen in patients with levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease . In the early stage of the disease, these states are often not noticed by patients and are a good sign of dopa responsiveness . Dyskinesias may be related to 'off' or 'on' periods, but as the disease advances they become a continuum and difficult to classify . Reducing dopaminergic drugs will diminish dyskinesia, but may lead to a return of Parkinson's disease symptoms . Dementia is an important cause of comorbidity in parkinsonism; when cognition declines, mortality increases . Dementia is a bad sign and will often lead to the breakdown of support networks . Estimation of the incidence of dementia has proved difficult . This can lead to a false estimation of cognitive function unless time is spent carefully assessing patients . Global intellectual decline (dementia) is usually a feature of parkinsonism in the elderly, with more than 30% of patients over 70 years affected . Memory disturbance may be a warning sign, although younger patients may complain of short-term memory problems for many years . Hallucinosis is particularly worrying and often presages dementia (Table 7.5) . The cause of parkinsonian dementia is unclear . Management of dementia is difficult and requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team (see Fast Facts: Dementia) . Wandering can be a problem; if confused, the patient will need constant supervision . Depression and anxiety . Depression/anxiety is a marker for dementia in older patients . However, depression must not be mistaken for dementia . Pseudo-dementia can be mistaken for Parkinson's disease dementia . A syndrome of apathy distinct from depression, anxiety and fatigue is increasingly recognized in Parkinson's disease . Psychosis causes gross impairment in reality testing . Psychotic patients evaluate their perceptions abnormally, leading to incorrect interpretation of external reality . Overstimulation of mesencephalic-limbic dopamine receptors causes limbic system dysfunction, leading to psychosis . The management of drug-induced psychosis is outlined in Figure 7.2 . Sleep problems in Parkinson's disease are common and may affect 60-98% of individuals at both early and late stages of the disease . The cause of restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease remains unclear, although it occurs around twice as commonly as in the general population . REM behavior disorder in particular has emerged as an important symptom that may predict the motor diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by years . Autonomic problems . Autonomic problems occur with increasing frequency in advanced disease, as has been shown in the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) study . Sensory problems . Sensory problems associated with the disease mainly comprise pain syndromes and akathisia, usually in the 'off' state . Declaration of non-motor symptoms . Early recognition of non-motor symptoms is important, as studies show that the burden of non-motor symptoms as a whole is the key determinant to quality of life . An international study showed that large numbers of patients do not declare these symptoms unless specifically asked . This can lead to a shocking neglect of symptoms that may be treatable, even in well-established centers of Parkinson's disease care . The NMSQuest (see Figure 3.5) empowers patients to declare their non-motor symptoms to health professionals (see Figure 3.6) . 
Neurocognitive impairments . Neuropsychological assessment . Eye-tracking abnormalities . What is the pathophysiology? Neurocognitive impairments may reflect the involvement of specific brain regions or neural circuits, or a more global involvement of the brain . The pattern of predominant impairments suggests the relatively selective involvement of frontotemporal areas . The results of functional imaging studies are also consistent with the selective involvement of frontotemporal areas, although this may be due in part to the nature of the cognitive tasks studied . These studies also implicate the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of these impairments . How do deficits relate to symptoms and outcome? Patients with negative symptoms are more likely to exhibit clinically significant neurocognitive impairments than patients without these symptoms . Patients with negative symptoms have also exhibited the most impairment on tasks requiring self-generated, rather than stimulus-driven, activity . The relationship of neurocognitive impairments to the broad range of symptom and functional outcomes suggests that the development of effective treatments for these impairments would have far-reaching beneficial effects on people with schizophrenia . This can be seen in the lower than expected activation of the ventral striatum on functional MRI . Functional imaging . Whatever else underlies the symptoms and deficits of schizophrenia, there is plainly a disturbance of brain function . Schizophrenia research has, therefore, been quick to use imaging techniques that demonstrate disturbances in brain function . Similar changes of lesser magnitude also occur in brain regions executing a complex cognitive task, such as solving a puzzle . These changes can be used to clarify which areas of the brain are being used to do specific tasks . Molecular imaging . Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were the first true functional brain-scanning techniques . Functional imaging . The safest and most widely used technique is functional magnetic resonance (fMR) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) imaging . This produces a map of regional cerebral blood flow and brain activity from the natural change in paramagnetic properties of hemoglobin as it deoxygenates . Image analysis involves two general approaches . In the top-down 'region of interest' approach, functional images have to be mapped precisely onto structural scans ('coregistration') . Using this approach, images from groups of subjects, or from the same subjects during and after a cognitive challenge, are transformed into identical brain shapes . Chemical imaging . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows the assessment of brain biochemistry . Imaging brain function is more difficult than imaging brain structure . A common method of investigating the abnormal brain function underpinning a cognitive deficit is to first scan a control subject before and during the execution of a relevant task . By subtracting the brain activity map as it was before the task from the map during the task, the specific areas of the brain involved in the task will be highlighted . The same brain activity maps are then produced for people with schizophrenia before and during the same task, which can then be compared with the pattern in control subjects . Resting state fMR studies are increasingly being used, with advanced image analysis that detects correlations in activity between brain areas . This abnormal pattern has also been found in unaffected relatives . Mapping symptoms . Functional imaging has been informative at the level of understanding individual symptoms, symptom clusters and specific cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (Figure 7.2) . The three overlapping syndromes outlined in Chapter 2 correlate with particular cognitive deficits and with distinct patterns of brain function (Tables 7.3 and 7.4) . Among positive symptoms, auditory hallucinations, rather than delusions, have been most extensively studied . During auditory hallucinations, increased blood flow is seen in Broca's area in the left hemisphere . In a healthy brain, a connected area of cortex in the superior temporal gyrus is deactivated during inner speech . Functional imaging shows that this does not occur in hallucinating patients, suggesting that hallucinations may actually be misinterpreted inner speech . In some cases, the link between a specific symptom and a functional abnormality emerges only under particular conditions . Patients with auditory hallucinations show right-sided temporoparietal and parahippocampal deficits during inner speech tasks, which again suggest an internal monitoring problem . The disorganization syndrome correlates with increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus, a region involved in selective attention . 
Essentially, M0-M5 describe stages of myeloid maturation; M6 and M7 describe erythroid leukemia and megakaryocytic leukemia, respectively . The FAB classification has been superseded by the WHO classification (Table 2.3) and the ELN risk stratification (Table 2.4), which include highly relevant cytogenetic and genetic aberrations . However, morphologic description using the FAB terminology is still a common feature of clinical discussion among clinicians and with patients . Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells provides important independent prognostic information and is a feature of both the WHO and ELN systems . The prognostic categories using cytogenetics are 'favorable', 'intermediate' and 'adverse' risk, based on the presence of structural and/or numeric chromosomal abnormalities . The prognostic value of cytogenetic analysis is discussed in further detail in Chapter 5 . Conversely, TP53 mutations (typically, but not exclusively, observed in the setting of complex karyotypes) are associated with adverse risk . The number of genes mutated in AML that are known to have (or suspected of having) prognostic or therapeutic relevance is growing . Mutations beyond those used in the WHO and ELN systems are beyond the scope of this book; WHO is expected to add further genetic mutations in its 2018 update . Novel drugs that inhibit/modulate aberrant pathways activated by some of these genes (exempli gratia IDH1, IDH2, KMT2A) are currently being evaluated in clinical trials (see Chapter 6) . The mutation is most commonly an ITD . FLT3 -ITD is an adverse prognostic factor, associated with an increased risk for relapse and poor survival outcomes (see Chapter 5) . Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain are less common (8% of patients) and have uncertain prognostic significance . Clinical presentation . Typically, the onset of symptoms is no more than 3 months before diagnosis . Fatigue is a common first symptom (Table 2.1), often accompanied by anorexia and weight loss . Fever or infection is the initial symptom in approximately 10% of patients, and 5% have signs of abnormal hemostasis (beyond minor bleeding and easy bruising) . Bone pain, lymphadenopathy, non-specific cough, headache and diaphoresis (excessive sweating) may also occur . Bone pain, typically vaguely localized to the pelvis or back, is also a frequent symptom . Physical findings . Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy may also be present but are relatively uncommon . Hemorrhagic complications are most commonly and classically found in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) . Thrombosis is a less frequent but well-recognized feature of APL . Bleeding associated with coagulopathy may also occur in monocytic AML, or with extreme degrees of leukocytosis or thrombocytopenia in other morphologic subtypes . Retinal hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia and extreme leukocytosis is detected in approximately 15% of patients . Hematologic findings . Red blood cells . Hemorrhage may rarely contribute to the anemia . White blood cells (WBC) . The predominant WBC is the myeloid blast . Extreme leukocytosis (> 100 000/μL, 'hyperleukocytosis') occurs in about 20% of cases . For example, the myeloblasts in APL are classically hypergranular with clusters of Auer rods (called faggot cells) with a bi-lobed or reniform nucleus . Differential diagnosis . Myeloproliferative disorders with bone marrow fibrosis can also present similarly . Examples include solid organ cancers with extensive marrow involvement, and granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis . However, acute leukemia is the appropriate diagnosis in patients with circulating blasts visualized on light microscopy . The circulating myeloid blasts contain Auer rods . Auer rods are not seen in lymphoblastic leukemia; their presence confirms a diagnosis of myeloid leukemia . Pretreatment evaluation . Initial assessments should evaluate the functional integrity of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic and renal systems, and patients should also be evaluated for infection and DIC . 
Despite initial treatment, ovarian cancer will recur in nearly two-thirds of women who originally presented with advanced disease . In this situation, the aims of treatment change from achieving cure to . preserving quality of life by mitigating treatment-related adverse effects and ameliorating symptoms of the recurrent disease . Recurrent ovarian cancer may present in a number of ways, and may be asymptomatic or symptomatic . With asymptomatic (chemical) recurrence, disease may be minimal and the value of treatment in this situation has been challenged . Imaging studies may be ordered if CA125 is not used to monitor for recurrence, but this approach is costly and exposes the patient to significant radiation over time . Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of imaging is suboptimal in ovarian cancer, because patients often exhibit numerous postsurgical changes; moreover, recurrences can occur with small-volume disease . Many clinicians reserve imaging for patients who present with symptoms or physical examination findings that are suggestive of recurrence . Some patients with recurrent ovarian cancer may present with abdominal symptoms such as bloating, early satiety, pain or a change in urinary or bowel habits, or with more systemic symptoms such as fatigue . The choice of treatment in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer will depend on a number of patient-, drug- and tumor-related factors (Figure 7.1) . Nevertheless, the traditional definitions of platinum resistance or sensitivity remain relevant in guiding treatment (Figure 7.2) . Platinum-sensitive patients are generally treated with platinum-containing regimens . Patients in whom recurrence occurs more than 6 months after primary platinum treatment are often subdivided into two groups . highly platinum-sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs more than 12 months after primary platinum treatment . intermediately sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs 6-12 months after primary treatment . Platinum-resistant patients, in whom recurrence occurs within 6 months of primary platinum treatment, are generally treated with non-platinum options; these usually include single agent chemotherapies with or without bevacizumab . Some clinicians define patients who actually progress on front-line treatment as platinum-refractory . They are often treated similarly to platinum-resistant patients, although some clinicians recommend continuing the platinum backbone while substituting the taxane with an alternative chemotherapeutic . The prognosis and probability of response to subsequent treatment correlate directly with the time from the previous platinum or other treatment (Figure 7.3) . It should be emphasized that any patient who can potentially participate in a clinical trial should be offered this option as the preferred treatment . Chemotherapy for platinum-sensitive disease . The initial treatment decision for a patient with platinum-sensitive disease is whether or not to perform surgery (see page 54) . Chemotherapy options for platinum-sensitive disease have continued to expand . Many platinum-sensitive patients will respond to numerous regimens; as described above, some clinicians treat patients with recurrence at 6-12 months differently to those with recurrence more than 12 months after previous platinum treatment . This is especially true when the recurrence is close to the 6-month cut-off, because many such patients have a response and prognosis similar to those who are platinum-resistant . Key Phase III clinical trials with chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease are summarized in Table 7.1 . Biological therapy for platinum-sensitive disease . Bevacizumab represents another option for platinum-sensitive patients . As discussed in Chapter 8, PARP inhibitors confer an excellent response in platinum-sensitive patients, and their role appears to be expanding beyond patients with biomarkers such as BRCA mutations . The challenge for clinicians will be to decide upon the best use of these agents as either treatment or maintenance options in platinum-sensitive patients . Chemotherapy for platinum-resistant disease . Patients with disease that recurs within 6 months of primary platinum treatment are generally treated with single agents, with or without bevacizumab . An important decision for clinicians is how best to use bevacizumab for the treatment of ovarian cancer . In some regions, bevacizumab is used in the front-line setting, while in others it is restricted to platinum-sensitive patients . Both the AURELIA trial in platinum-resistant patients, and the OCEANS trial in platinum-sensitive patients, yielded identical hazard ratios of 0.48 for PFS . Appropriate patient selection is crucial (see Chapter 5) . 
Obesity is associated with reduced lung volume, which is linked with airway narrowing . For children, obesity at the time of diagnosis is a major risk for OSA persisting after treatment, regardless of the severity of initial disease . OSA is associated with an increase in motor vehicle- and work-related accidents . Central obesity is associated with an increased risk of non-atopic asthma . Obese patients with asthma are less likely than non-obese patients to achieve optimal control of their disease . Weight reduction and physical activity reverse the respiratory complications of obesity . Weight reduction and increased physical activity should be priorities in obese patients to improve insulin sensitivity . Gastroesophageal reflux disease . Obesity is associated with an increase in symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hospitalization for GERD-related complications . Gallbladder disease . Obese patients are at increased risk for biliary disease, with a higher incidence of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis and cholesterolosis . The incidence of gallbladder disease is increasing in children and adolescents concomitant with the increasing incidence of obesity . Weight loss does not benefit patients with biliary disease, and cholecystectomy is usually required . Table 4.2 lists the reproductive consequences of obesity . Erectile dysfunction is a marker of cardiovascular risk . It is a consequence of visceral obesity and the associated metabolic abnormalities that induce endothelial dysfunction . OSA is also associated with erectile dysfunction . Weight loss through a lifestyle modification program is associated with improvements in erectile dysfunction in obese men . Weight gain and central adiposity in adulthood are particularly associated with an increased risk of LUTS . Obese men may have fewer sertoli cells than men of normal weight . The presence and severity of urinary incontinence in women are associated with increasing body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference . Urinary incontinence also has an adverse effect on sexual function in obese women . Induction of labor is more likely to be required and there is an increased risk of cesarean section, which in itself is associated with greater risk in obese women . Obesity also increases the risk of complications from surgery and radiation therapy . There is no current consensus regarding appropriate dosing of chemotherapy in the obese patient . Obesity may impact on the risk, detection and outcome of prostate cancer . Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and also cancers with worse pathological features and higher biochemical relapse rates . Breast cancer . The relationship between obesity and breast cancer risk as well as the clinical behavior of the disease is complicated . In postmenopausal women, particularly the elderly, obesity is positively associated with risk for breast cancer, whereas before menopause increased bodyweight is inversely related to breast cancer risk . The mechanisms by which bodyweight and obesity affect risk have been related to estrogenic activity in both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer . Obesity has also been related to advanced disease at diagnosis and with a poor prognosis . Bodyweight and BMI increase the risk of colon cancer in men, but not in women . Obesity increases the risk of RCC among women irrespective of fat distribution, whereas low hip circumference is related to increased risk of RCC in men . Alcohol, tobacco and obesity interact to increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma . Joint replacement surgery . Moderate obesity does not appear to affect the outcome of hip or knee replacement surgery in patients with arthritis . Obesity does not appear to confer an independent risk for hip or knee revision procedures . Obesity increases the risk of plantar fasciitis, achilles tendon rupture, meniscal tears, carpal tunnel syndrome and peripheral edema . However, the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity, most commonly depression, is increased in patients seeking treatment for obesity (40-60%) . Extreme obesity is associated with an increased risk for depression, and obese individuals in weight-loss trials experience reductions in symptoms of depression . Obesity in adolescence may be associated with depression in young adulthood . The syndrome is most frequently seen in women and is strongly associated with obesity and a recent increase in weight . Surgery and anesthetic risk . All surgery, but abdominal surgery in particular, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the obese . Table 4.3 shows the main complications of surgery in obese patients . 
Established antiepileptic drugs . Problems likely to be encountered in everyday clinical practice are highlighted . The first clinical studies in epilepsy were not carried out until 1963 . Side effects . Clobazam (CLB) . Twice-daily administration is preferred for doses exceeding 30 mg . Side effects . Nevertheless, depression, irritability and tiredness have been reported . The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established . Serum concentrations less than 40 mg/liter are usually ineffective . A transient leukopenia has been described . PB may also be used for myoclonic seizures . Side effects . The half-life of PB is 4 days . Phenytoin (PHT) . It is available in oral and intravenous forms . PHT is associated with rash in approximately 5% of patients . PHT may also be a teratogen . PHT is metabolized in the liver . Serum concentrations should then be checked after 1-2 weeks . Enteral feeding has been reported to decrease PHT absorption . Therefore, it is primarily used as adjunctive therapy . Side effects . Like PB, PRM is a powerful enzyme inducer . Sodium valproate (VPA) . It also facilitates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA . Side effects . Modern antiepileptic drugs . The dose can be titrated further to 1200 mg once daily . Limited safety information is available for patients over 65 years of age . Side effects . ESL is generally well tolerated . Its half-life ranges from 15 to 24 hours . It may exacerbate myoclonic jerks and generalized absences . Side effects are generally mild and transient . Its half-life is 6-9 hours . A useful serum concentration range has not been established . LCM is also available as a syrup and intravenous injection . Side effects . LCM does not inhibit or induce hepatic metabolic enzymes . The drug seldom causes sedation . Daily doses of up to 4000 mg appear to be well tolerated . Side effects . LEV is generally well tolerated . Some patients complain of headache, anorexia and nervousness . Idiosyncratic skin rash with LEV has been rarely reported . Early data suggest that this drug may be safe in pregnancy . Children clear LEV faster than adults . PER is taken once daily . Side effects . PER undergoes rapid absorption with near optimal bioavailability . Many patients experience weight gain, particularly at high PGB doses . Peripheral edema has also been noted occasionally . The absorption of PGB is rapid, linear and almost complete . Side effects . Its administration may increase serum digoxin concentration . Side effects . Status epilepticus was reported during the clinical trial program . Side effects . Asymptomatic neutropenia was occasionally observed . Routine monitoring of plasma levels is not required . TGB is rapidly and completely absorbed . Food reduces the rate, but not the extent, of absorption . VPA levels may drop slightly by an unknown mechanism . A useful effect on generalized absences has yet to be shown . It is administered in two divided doses and should be introduced slowly . Concentration monitoring of TPM is unnecessary . Acute glaucoma has been reported . Vigabatrin (VGB) . It can worsen myoclonic jerks and generalized absences . Children with coexistent tuberous sclerosis often demonstrate a particularly favorable response . Few show further improvement at higher doses . Side effects . Paranoid and psychotic symptoms can develop . VGB can cause hyperkinesia and agitation in children . No idiosyncratic reactions have been reported . There is no evidence that VGB is a human teratogen . ZNS has proven efficacy for drug-resistant partial seizures . Patients with renal dysfunction have lower rates of clearance . Antiepileptic drug treatment guidelines . 
Lower urinary tract symptoms become more prevalent with age . Management of the symptoms can be challenging, as the elderly are less likely to tolerate surgical or pharmaceutical treatments, and their symptoms are often secondary to multiple causes . Urinary incontinence is a frequent cause of institutionalization in the elderly . Finding the cause of urinary incontinence is more important in the elderly than in younger patients . The elderly are more likely to have multiple coexisting symptoms and may have multiple pathologies to account for them . Empirical treatment based on symptoms and a frequency/volume bladder record can be unsatisfactory . Cystometry is well tolerated in the elderly . Also, in the elderly patient, antimuscarinic drugs may be more likely to cause drowsiness and cognitive impairment . The risk of postoperative urinary retention is relatively high in the elderly because of their reduced detrusor contractility . Nocturia is particularly common in the elderly and is discussed in Chapter 8 . Poor detrusor contractility is common in the elderly and can impair voiding even in the absence of bladder outlet obstruction . Urinary retention . Urinary tract infections are common in elderly women, occurring in up to 46% over the course of a year . Treatment of UTIs in elderly women with no identifiable pathology is with low-dose vaginal estrogen and prophylactic antibiotics, as described in Chapter 7 . Polypharmacy (the use of multiple medications concurrently) is common in the elderly, and incontinence is frequently a result of medications prescribed for other conditions . Lower urinary tract symptoms are common during pregnancy, and childbirth is often cited as a cause for subsequent urinary, colorectal and genital dysfunction . Bladder filling symptoms . Between 45% and 90% of women will develop urinary frequency as pregnancy progresses . Urgency is a common symptom in pregnancy, reported by up to 70% of women . Nocturia is common in pregnancy and is rarely pathological . Urinary incontinence . Stress urinary incontinence in pregnancy is common - it has been reported in up to 85% of pregnant women . It therefore seems likely that both pregnancy and any mode of delivery can cause pelvic floor dysfunction . Voiding symptoms . During pregnancy one-third of women report hesitancy and an inability to empty their bladder completely . However, these symptoms are rarely associated with voiding disorders on urodynamic testing . Management involves bladder drainage and manual reduction of the uterus . The most common cause of postnatal voiding disorders and urinary retention is the use of epidural and spinal anesthesia during labor and delivery . However, all women are at risk of urinary retention, and careful surveillance during and after delivery is important . Urinary retention requires prompt catheterization . It should be noted that many women have reduced bladder sensation after delivery, and urinary retention may not present with pain . It is more common on the right side . Hydronephrosis is largely asymptomatic and does not require treatment, and will resolve spontaneously on delivery . Urinary tract infections . Fistula-related incontinence . A fistula is an abnormal communication between two epithelialized structures . The urinary tract fistula most commonly responsible for urinary incontinence is the vesicovaginal fistula (VVF; Figure 10.1) . If the fistula is large, the patient may not void normally at all and may have continuous leakage of urine into the vagina . It is important to distinguish VVF from other causes of urinary incontinence; investigations should include a full examination . Examination under anesthesia may be required to determine the presence of a fistula . It is also important to assess the mobility of the tissues and the accessibility of a fistula for surgical repair . Although IVU is not particularly sensitive in the diagnosis of VVF, knowledge of the upper urinary tracts may be important when considering treatment . The initial management of most urinary tract fistulas is generally conservative . Surgical management . There is some debate as to the timing of surgical treatment of urinary tract fistulas . Early treatment is advocated by some because of the social and psychological benefits to women who are already distressed . It is therefore important not to be pressured by the patient into operating on a fistula too soon, as this may jeopardize the surgical outcome . The fistula is identified and its tract excised . 
Clinical gene therapy is a very active field, with a large number of clinical trials, approaches and disease targets . Newer technologies such as gene editing will undoubtedly shape the design of future gene therapies . In the meantime, there are already a number of promising candidates in early-phase clinical trials that may add to the success of those more advanced gene therapies summarized in chapter 4 (Table 6.1) . Neuromuscular and neurological disorders . Although results from more patients and longer-term follow-up data are still emerging, initial clinical trial results are quite remarkable . Approximately half of these children die within the first 1.5 years after birth . In a first clinical trial, nine patients aged from 8 months to 6 years were treated by systemic administration of a high dose of AAV8 vector, with the hope of widely transferring the MTM1 gene to muscle cells . Substantial restoration of myotubularin levels and improvements in muscle fiber development were observed on muscle biopsy . Some patients were able to vocalize sounds for the first time and eat food . These advances were presented at the 2019 annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy . Mutations in the ABCD1 gene cause an enzyme deficiency called adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) . Impressively, these patients showed persistent therapeutic levels of aldolase protein for at least 3 years . Demyelination of the CNS was halted, resulting in stabilization of disease without any major safety complications . Cerebral ALD affects boys between ages 4 and 10 years, causing permanent disability; death occurs within 4-8 years of disease onset . As of early 2018, 29 individuals had received the gene therapy . While the CAG segment is normally repeated 10 to 35 times within the HTT gene, people with 40 or more repeats nearly always develop disease . These areas are affected by neuropathological changes at different stages of the disease . Using this approach, sustained lowering of huntingtin protein levels and functional improvements have been demonstrated in a mouse model of the disease . Lysosomal storage disorders . Glycogen storage disease type Ia . The hypoglycemia that results from the disease can be life-threatening . An investigational gene therapy is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial, based on systemic delivery of an AAV8 vector with hopes of achieving stable expression and activity of G6Pase-alpha under control of its native gene promoter . In preclinical studies, this gene therapy was particularly effective in reducing hepatic glycogen levels . Improved glucose control throughout the day and the ability to decrease daily cornstarch intake are further encouraging signs that the therapy is effective . Muscle disorders . Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the X-linked lethal muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin . Individuals with deleterious mutations in dystrophin typically show signs of muscle weakness at 2 to 3 years of age, followed by substantial deterioration of muscle function by 7 years of age . Correction of the disease by gene transfer is substantially complicated by the large size of the dystrophin gene (covering 2.3 mb, making it one of the largest known genes) and the need to correct a large number of muscles throughout the body . The dystrophin protein is made up of 3685 amino acid residues . For instance, dystrophic muscles may be inflamed, and T-cell responses against therapeutic dystrophin have been observed in some patients in prior clinical studies . Still, the field is cautiously optimistic that these problems can be solved and that a lasting therapeutic effect can be accomplished in this challenging disease . Mutations in globin genes can cause various forms of anemia . No ideal treatments are available, making these diseases major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide . Gene therapy based on lentiviral transduction of HSCs should be a route to a cure for these diseases . However, there is no selective advantage for gene-corrected cells, and obtaining sufficient levels of the globin transgene product has not been easy to accomplish . Myeloablative conditioning was performed to create space for the gene-corrected cells . The first patient treated in this manner gained independence from blood transfusions by 1 year after gene therapy . Sickle cell disease . This individual no longer required red blood cell transfusions and had a substantial clinical improvement that has been stable for at least 4 years . 
Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition . In high-income countries, approximately 6 per 1000 people will develop epilepsy during their lifetime, and 45 people per 100000 will develop new-onset epilepsy each year . These figures are nearly twice as high in low- and middle-income countries, possibly as a consequence of more primitive obstetric services as well as the greater likelihood of cerebral infection and head trauma . Incidence varies greatly with age, with high rates in early childhood, low levels in early adult life and a second peak in people aged over 65 years (Figure 1.1) . In recent years, there has been a fall in the number of children affected as well as a sharp rise in epilepsy in the elderly . Indeed, old age has now become the most common time in life to develop the condition . Most patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis . In many people - particularly children - the condition will remit, although a substantial proportion will have epilepsy all their lives . Overall, 60-70% of patients become seizure free after the start of treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) . Some of these patients become and remain seizure free on the initiation of the first AED, while in others the disorder appears to follow a more fluctuating course . Some patients can remain in remission after subsequent drug withdrawal, implying that the epileptogenic causes have truly remitted . The other 30-40% of patients continue to have seizures with varying degrees of frequency and severity . It is also increasingly recognized that some patients can have a 'remitting-relapsing' course, fluctuating between periods of seizure freedom and recurrence . Factors that indicate a poor prognosis for seizure control include . poor response to the initial AED treatment . symptomatic cause . high seizure frequency before AED treatment . family history of epilepsy . The standardized mortality ratio (the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths) for patients with epilepsy is two to three times above that of the general population . In many cases, the cause of death is related to the underlying etiology, but sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is believed to account for up to 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths . SUDEP has been defined as 'sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, non-traumatic and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, with or without evidence of a seizure, and excluding documented status epilepticus, in which postmortem examination does not reveal toxicological or anatomic cause of death' . The reported incidence of SUDEP ranges from 0.35 to 10 per 1000 patients per year . It is higher if the seizure disorder remains uncontrolled, suggesting that the majority of SUDEP is related to seizure activity . Other associated causes of death include drowning, burns, aspiration, pneumonia, status epilepticus and suicide . 
Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) . conservative care and symptom control . dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis) . kidney transplant (from a living or cadaveric donor) . In general, all patients should be offered all suitable choices, and be fully counseled as to the advantages and disadvantages of each . In reality, however, not all options are available in all centers, and patient-related factors can be limiting . Conservative care . Dialysis may not improve quality of life in patients with extensive comorbidities . Conservative care does not represent an absence of renal support, but rather the active medical (non-technological) management of the complications of kidney failure . It is clearly important that patients participate fully in these discussions wherever possible . A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial and should involve nurses, doctors, counselors and family members . Raising the dialysate calcium above the serum concentration, for example, can increase serum calcium in patients with hypocalcemia . A separate biophysical process, ultrafiltration, is used to regulate the distribution of water between the blood and dialysate . Patients need excellent vascular access, and access problems are a major cause of morbidity (Table 12.1) . Dialysis is usually performed three times each week for about 4 hours . Dialysis and ultrafiltration occur across these capillaries . This can be achieved with glucose or other large-molecular-weight solutes in the dialysate . The glucose load can cause problems of its own, such as poor diabetic control and weight gain . The waste solutes are removed by exchanging the peritoneal fluid for a fresh solution (Figure 12.3) . Peritoneal dialysis is carried out by the patient at home, at work or while on holiday . It therefore allows the patient a high degree of independence and control over their own illness . However, patients must not be allowed to become isolated, and still need considerable support . Intra-abdominal adhesions and abdominal wall stoma are absolute contraindications for peritoneal dialysis, and obesity, intestinal disease, respiratory disease and hernias are relative contraindications . The complications of peritoneal dialysis are listed in Table 12.2 . When to start dialysis . The question of when to start dialysis remains controversial . There is no good evidence that starting dialysis earlier is of any benefit to patients . Nevertheless, there are excellent data suggesting that earlier referral for nephrological care before renal replacement therapy is required can significantly delay the need for dialysis, and reduce early morbidity and mortality . Dialysis and pregnancy . Most women with ESKD on dialysis are infertile, and pregnancy is extremely uncommon . Fertility often returns rapidly after a successful kidney transplant (see below) . If women on dialysis do become pregnant, the outcome is usually poor with a very high risk of miscarriage, severe hypertension, small babies and prematurity . Only 47% of women have a successful obstetric outcome . A transplant can come from a cadaveric donor, from a living relative or from an unrelated living donor (often called emotionally related) . The sale of organs for transplantation is prohibited in almost all countries, but nevertheless continues, mostly because of the severe shortage of organs . Age itself is not a major determinant of outcome, though the presence of comorbid disease adversely affects survival (Table 12.3) . Over 90% of transplants should be working 1 year after surgery . A cadaveric transplant should have a mean survival of 15 years and a living transplant about 18-20 years . These drugs must be taken for life and require careful monitoring (Table 12.5) . Common complications . Routine postoperative problems, such as deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, can occur . Patients should be followed up for life and undergo annual screening for cancers, drug toxicity and cardiovascular disease in addition to routine clinic visits . Most patients with a transplant will die from cardiovascular disease, which should, therefore, be aggressively managed . Some immunosuppressants (exempli gratia mycophenolate mofetil) also pose a risk to the fetus . 
Social norms . Cigarette smoking is markedly influenced by social norms and other environmental influences . In cultures in which smoking is taboo for women, few women smoke . Smoking prevalence has declined as smoking has become more marginalized in sections of western society . The influence of social norms is also manifest in regional variations in smoking prevalence within countries . In the UK, for example, smoking prevalence increases with 'northerliness', even controlling for social class . Psychiatric disorders . There is a strong link between smoking and many psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, schizophrenia and substance abuse . Smoking is also prevalent among homeless people, many of whom suffer from mental health disorders . It is widely thought that smoking is particularly closely linked to schizophrenia, but in fact the dominant factors are the severity of the psychiatric disorder and whether the patient is institutionalized (Figure 3.1) . Thus, discussion about whether specific links exist between smoking behavior and the mechanisms that underlie schizophrenia or its treatment are somewhat premature . It is, however, clear that there is no evidence for deterioration overall in mental health when people with psychiatric disorders stop smoking and in some cases there may be an improvement . Alcohol intake and other drug-related disorders . Smokers are particularly likely to experience problems with illicit psychoactive drugs and alcohol . The link with alcohol abuse and alcoholism is particularly strong, leading some to suggest that heavy smokers should be screened for alcoholism . Smokers with alcohol use disorder find it harder to stop smoking; if they do stop, it does not adversely affect their prospects of recovery from that disorder, and may improve it . Criminality and antisocial behavior . Adolescents who engage in antisocial behavior, truant from school and express antisocial attitudes are more likely to smoke than those who do not engage in antisocial behavior . In adulthood, there is a strong correlation between having a criminal conviction and being a smoker . Government actions . Probably the greatest impact on smoking prevalence can be achieved through large-scale social and governmental policies . Table 3.1 summarizes the options and their likely effects . Taxation is the most clearly established of the many ways in which governments can influence smoking . A 10% increase in the price of cigarettes relative to earnings is linked, on average, to a 4% reduction in consumption by adults . In teenagers, the effect is greater, with a 10% increase in cost linked to a 10% decrease in consumption . In countries such as the UK, smokers support these kinds of policies, presumably because they recognize that they can provide an added incentive to stop - which is what they mostly want to do . Taxation has to be linked to effective countermeasures against illicit supply . It is important to structure it to prevent tobacco companies using pricing policies to undermine its deterrent effect . Not all of the decrease in consumption involves smokers giving up altogether; in some cases smokers merely reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke . The health benefits of this action may be undermined, however, because smokers tend to smoke each cigarette more intensively . It is also not fully known how reductions in consumption translate into health benefits . Nevertheless, it is clear that increasing the cost of smoking is, potentially, an important public health measure . Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence . The size of the effect is related to the intensity of the campaign (as indexed by viewing numbers) and whether it is sustained . Bans on tobacco advertising . Tobacco companies spend many billions of dollars annually promoting their brands . In many countries, including the USA, tobacco advertising is banned from television but is permitted in print media . For this reason, and because of moral concerns over permitting promotion of a product that is addictive and often lethal when used as intended, several countries, including those in the European Union, have implemented a total ban on tobacco promotion . An international treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (see Chapter 8) mandates this and other tobacco control measures . Plain packaging . Several countries have implemented legislation requiring cigarette and tobacco to be sold in standard plain packages carrying graphic health warnings and the brand name in a standard font with no brand imagery . The effect is expected primarily to be on take-up of smoking - with cigarettes becoming less attractive to adolescents . Indoor smoking bans have been introduced in public indoor areas in many countries, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and in most jurisdictions in the USA . 
Anorexia nervosa is characterized by the refusal to maintain a bodyweight equal to or above a minimally normal weight for the individual's age and height . Bodyweight is at least 15% below the norm . The weight loss is self-induced by several means . use of laxatives or diuretics . self-induced vomiting . excessive exercise . Individuals with anorexia exhibit an overwhelming fear of putting on weight and a distorted view of the size and shape of their body . Postmenarcheal females experience amenorrhea, id est the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles, or if the menstrual cycle occurs it does so only as a result of hormone administration . There are two subtypes of anorexia . restricting type, in which the individual does not regularly engage in binge-eating or purging behavior . Binge-eating is characterized by eating large amounts of food in a discrete amount of time and feeling a sense of a lack of control . Purging behavior includes self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas . The specific diagnostic criteria for anorexia from the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 - Diagnosis . Definition of bulimia nervosa . Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of significant binge-eating - eating large amounts of food in a discrete amount of time and feeling a sense of a lack of control - followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain . There are two subtypes of bulimia . purging type, in which the individual regularly engages in purging behavior, such as self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas . non-purging type, in which the individual does not regularly engage in purging behavior, but uses other inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as fasting or excessive exercising . Those who suffer from bulimia use their binge and purge cycles to prevent weight gain and to regulate other emotional difficulties . Unlike anorexia, bulimia does not generally result in significant weight loss and in many ways is a very secretive disease . The shame and isolation experienced by individuals suffering from this disorder can hinder recovery . The specific DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for bulimia are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 - Diagnosis . Definition of eating disorders not otherwise specified . DSM-IV classifies both anorexia and bulimia under a specific diagnostic category entitled 'Eating Disorders', which also includes a third classification entitled 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' ('atypical eating disorder' in the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision [ICD-10]) . This last category includes binge-eating disorder and night-eating syndrome, discussed in Chapter 9 of this book, and may be used to describe eating disorders that meet some but not all of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia or bulimia: for example, an individual with almost all of the symptoms of anorexia but who still has a normal and regular menstrual cycle and/or a normal body mass index, or cases with overevaluation of weight and shape associated with purging behaviors at least twice a week but no binge-eating episodes ('eating disorder not otherwise specified' [EDNOS] purging type) . Patients that present with subsyndromal criteria should be monitored in order to identify the development of a full-syndrome eating disorder . Primary care physicians should conduct a comprehensive assessment to uncover any significant risk factors in the patient's life that could rapidly lead to a full-syndrome eating disorder . The primary care physician may invite the patient for serial assessments to track symptoms over time, consulting or referring with a specialist if needed . 
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy to affect men of middle age and beyond in most developed countries and, increasingly in developing countries, it is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths in men . The lifetime risk of developing clinical prostate cancer in western countries is about 1 in 8 . Approximately 80% of men aged 80 years have prostate cancer at autopsy . However, many of these cancers grow slowly and the risk of developing clinically detectable cancer is about 13%; the lifetime risk of actually dying from prostate cancer is approximately 3% . However, prostate cancer primarily affects men over the age of 50 years, so the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer is predicted to increase substantially over the next two decades as a result of the worldwide trend towards an aging population . Despite the high incidence of prostate cancer, relatively little is known about the underlying causes . Age is the greatest factor that influences the development of prostate cancer . Clinical disease is rare in men under the age of 50 years but the incidence increases markedly over 60 years of age . Marked geographic and racial variations are seen in the incidence of clinical prostate cancer (Table 1.2) . In the USA, the risk is higher in black men than in white men, and black men also appear to develop more aggressive disease earlier . The incidence of prostate cancer is lowest in Chinese and Japanese races, although the prevalence is now increasing in both . The incidence of latent (clinically insignificant) disease is similar in all populations studied . The incidence of prostate cancer in men who emigrate from a low- to a high-risk area increases to that of the local population within two generations . This suggests that environmental influences such as diet and lifestyle factors may have a profound effect on the development of prostate cancer and on the progression of latent to clinically detectable cancer . Family history/genetic risk . Epidemiology studies show that heritable factors account for a small proportion of prostate cancer risk but a higher proportion of early-onset disease . However, a host of studies have suggested the existence of prostate cancer susceptibility genes . Family history is a strong risk factor for prostate cancer: the risk of a man developing prostate cancer is increased approximately 2.5-fold if he has a first-degree relative who is affected . The relative risks for developing prostate cancer based on family history are shown in Table 1.3 . The high incidence of familial prostate cancer prompted a search for germline mutations . The strongest evidence for direct causality comes from families who develop cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome - the risk of developing prostate cancer is elevated twofold for those carrying the abnormal gene . However, the incidence of prostate cancer increases with age, while serum testosterone levels decrease . In addition, men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer often have a lower average testosterone level than men of a similar age who do not have prostate cancer . Early studies showed an increased risk of prostate cancer in obese men whereas more recent studies indicate that levels of detected prostate cancer are in fact lower in obese men . A recently published study on risk factors for prostate cancer reported that being obese was associated with a 44% increase in the risk of prostate cancer diagnosis . Prostate cancer mortality is significantly higher in men who are obese . A number of studies support links between the intake of saturated fat and red and processed meats in particular and the development of prostate cancer . There is also some evidence that alpha-linoleic acid, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, increases the risk of prostate cancer and of developing advanced disease, which may be the result of oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage or the development of obesity . Omega-3 fatty acids from marine sources may, however, decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer . The risk of dying from prostate cancer is related geographically to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and men with prostate cancer have lower levels of vitamin D . Most prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas . However, these microscopic tumors often grow very slowly, and many never progress to clinical disease . The Gleason grading system is widely used for grading prostate cancer (Figure 1.4) . If the tertiary grade has a high score (4 or 5), the patient has increased risk of disease progression even if the primary and secondary grades are lower, and the tertiary rather than the secondary grade informs the score . Patterns of disease spread . The tumor stage (T1-T4) describes the pathological development of the tumor . T4 represents advanced disease, where the tumor has invaded neighboring organs (Figure 1.6) . 
Individuals are often able to date the onset of symptoms to a specific month . Occasionally, an individual with ALS will perceive that the initial symptom came on overnight . More rarely, an individual with ALS will report transient remission of weakness . Individual symptoms depend on the region affected and the relative burden of upper and lower motor neuron disease . Lower motor neuron (LMN) disease causes more overt weakness, loss of muscle bulk (atrophy), muscle twitching (fasciculation) and cramps . More unusual presentations of ALS include respiratory-onset disease, with weight loss and orthopnea, and cognitive or behavioral change . Limb symptoms . Most people with ALS first develop symptoms in the limbs . This is called spinal-onset ALS . Individuals with ALS may report a weak limb, hand or foot as 'dead' despite normal sensation, so it is important to clarify such language . Lower limb symptoms . LMN disease in the legs presents as weakness, most commonly starting in the ankle dorsiflexors . The individual finds it difficult to lift their foot and presents with frequent tripping or stumbling due to foot drop . Upper limb symptoms . They are often worse after prolonged exercise . Those with ALS also have frequent, disabling cramps . However, in the presence of progressive muscular weakness it is a common and important sign in ALS (see Case report 3.1) . Fasciculation without weakness, especially in someone under the age of 40, is rarely due to ALS, but muscle weakness is always pathological . Bulbar symptoms . Bulbar symptoms initially comprise changes in speech and, later, problems with swallowing . More specific UMN symptoms include frequent gagging due to hypersensitivity of the gag response, and laryngospasm . A less obvious but frequently encountered UMN bulbar symptom is pseudobulbar affect (PBA) . Excessive yawning is a frequently concurrent symptom . Weakness may be an LMN sign or a UMN sign . LMN weakness often has associated atrophy . Tongue atrophy in ALS is invariably symmetric (unlike atrophy in the limbs) (Figure 3.2) . Individuals with ALS usually do not report fasciculation (unlike those with benign fasciculation) . Muscle tone is reduced in LMN disease . This is not commonly a useful sign, as it only becomes apparent when weakness is advanced . Lower motor neuron weakness in a limb characteristically affects muscles supplied by more than one peripheral nerve or nerve root . When onset is in the leg, the ankle dorsiflexors are often involved early . The eyes should have a full range of movement in all but very advanced cases of ALS . Neck flexion and extension is an important test; a degree of weakness in one or both directions is a common finding in ALS . Upper motor neuron weakness typically affects a limb in a pyramidal pattern . Sensation is normal in ALS . Less common presentations . Respiratory-onset ALS . Signs of respiratory insufficiency (Table 3.3) should be sought whenever a diagnosis of ALS is suspected . Rarely, they are the presenting symptoms (approximately 3% of ALS cases are 'respiratory onset') . Weight loss is a key symptom and may be prominent (Case report 3.3) . In respiratory-onset ALS, it is predominantly due to the increased caloric demand from the sheer work of breathing . Both dyspnea and weight loss in ALS are frequently incorrectly associated with either cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or to occult malignancy, respectively . It is therefore important to be alert to ALS as a possible underlying cause and to examine the individual carefully for signs of motor neuron involvement (see Case report 3.3) . Individuals with respiratory-onset ALS often have associated weakness of their axial muscles . ALS-FTD presentation . It was previously thought that cognition was unaffected in ALS . When FTD is the presenting feature of ALS, motor features are often recognized soon after the cognitive or behavioral changes . Primary lateral sclerosis presentation . Weakness is far less prominent a symptom than in typical ALS . The symptoms most commonly start in the legs . In a minority with an initial bulbar presentation, common symptoms include a strained or forced voice and marked emotional lability . 
Diabetic pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome for the fetus, but there is little excess mortality among diabetic women . Pregnancy may be complicated by type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and, increasingly, by type 2 diabetes . Occasionally, both types 1 and 2 may be diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy . Of all pregnancies in the USA, 3-10% are complicated by diabetes (90% are cases of GDM) . The fetal morbidity associated with diabetes is shown in Table 12.1 . There is a miscarriage rate of 9-14% among women with pre-existing diabetes . The risk of a structural anomaly in the fetus is four to eight times the rate in the normal population . The congenital malformation rate in diabetic pregnancy is 5.1-9.8% . Diabetic pregnancy is linked with the development of large-for-gestational-age babies, but growth restriction in patients with pre-existing type 1 diabetes may also occur, particularly when the diabetes is associated with vascular complications . Fetal macrosomia (affecting 15-45% of babies born to diabetic women) is a frequent complication of diabetic pregnancy and increases the likelihood of birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus trauma . Perinatal mortality has fallen greatly in diabetic pregnancies but remains approximately twice that observed in non-diabetic pregnancies, with serious congenital malformations accounting for a large proportion of fetal loss . Management of a diabetic pregnancy . The management of existing diabetes must start in the preconception period . Women should take folic acid, 5 mg daily, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects . After conception women should be seen as soon as possible in a combined diabetic/obstetric clinic with access to a dedicated diabetes physician, obstetrician, diabetes specialist nurse, dietitian and midwife . Metformin can be continued throughout the pregnancy by a woman with type 2 diabetes, though most women will require additional insulin . Women with type 1 diabetes should be advised of an increased risk of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness in the first trimester . Insulin-treated women are best managed by an insulin pump regimen during labor or Cesarean section . Effect on complications . Pregnancy may be hazardous to women with pre-existing complications of diabetes . A successful outcome of pregnancy is unlikely when the serum creatinine exceeds 250 µmol/L . Hypertension and pre-eclampsia are more common in diabetic mothers . GDM is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy . The large multinational Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study has demonstrated a linear relationship between maternal hyperglycemia and birth weight, with no apparent threshold effect between maternal glycemia and pregnancy outcome . The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has attempted to achieve an international consensus on screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes . It recommends a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all women who are not known to be diabetic at 24-28 weeks . Women should be screened for risk factors at booking . For high-risk women, a one-step approach could be used by proceeding directly to the 100 g 3-hour OGTT . However, at present, the American Diabetes Association is planning to consider adoption of the IADPSG diagnostic criteria . GDM usually appears after the middle of the second trimester and much of the perinatal morbidity in GDM is associated with the delivery of a large-for-gestational-age baby . The risks associated with GDM are listed in Table 12.2 . All women should receive dietary advice from a dietitian and be encouraged to take physical exercise . When glucose targets are not met, and particularly when fetal ultrasound shows incipient fetal macrosomia, insulin therapy should be started . Advising women . Women with GDM need to be informed that the condition confers an increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes and should be strongly advised to reduce this risk postnatally by reducing weight and taking regular exercise . Neonatal care involves the detection of hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress, polycythemia and other complications consequent to maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy . Babies born to diabetic mothers are at increased risk of developing obesity and diabetes . 
In the context of cancer, the term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic targets . Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science . What types of tumor are potentially susceptible to immuno-oncology? . Cancer is characterized by an accumulation of genetic mutations, many of which result in the expression of cancer-specific antigens that can bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the cancer cell surface . Potential targets for cancer immunotherapy . A variety of cancer immunotherapy strategies are currently being investigated, or have already entered clinical practice . Passive immunotherapies . Tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically target malignant cells are among the best characterized forms of cancer immunotherapy . inhibition of signaling pathways in tumor cells . CAR-T therapy . Such T cells are genetically modified to express a transmembrane protein consisting of a synthetic T-cell receptor that targets a predetermined antigen expressed by the tumor . Following infusion of these cells, the patient's immune system actively surveys and engages specific cancer cells that express the antigen . Oncolytic viruses are non-pathogenic viruses that specifically infect cancer cells . Such viruses may kill cancer cells in two ways . an innate cytopathic effect resulting from overloaded cell metabolism in response to viral infection . expression of potentially lethal gene products . Clinical trials of T-VEC are ongoing for a variety of cancers, either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors . Active immunotherapies . Preventative antiviral vaccines . These relationships also create the potential for antiviral vaccines to be used to prevent cancer . Therapeutic vaccines . Dendritic cell-based immunotherapies . There is currently no consensus on the optimal approach to dendritic cell-based immunotherapy . Peptide- and DNA-based vaccines . Anticancer vaccines could potentially be either peptide-based or DNA-based . Similarly, no DNA-based vaccine has yet been shown to be beneficial in clinical trials . Whole-cell tumor vaccines are another potential anticancer vaccination . The attenuated tumor cells are then combined with an appropriate adjuvant and injected back into the patient, triggering an immune response . Cytokine antibodies and targeted agents . It is also important in regulating T helper cell function . In cancer, IL-6 is also important in . regulation of self-renewal of cancer stem cells . the development of cancer cachexia syndrome . Therapeutic antibodies to IL-6 have also been trialed in cancer patients, including studies in the management of cancer cachexia syndrome . Other cancer therapies target the JAK/STAT signaling pathway . A number of PRR agonists have been approved for use in cancer patients, including . The anticancer effects of BCG result from the recruitment and activation of immune cells, including CD4+ T cells, which eliminate cancer cells that have internalized BCG . Inducers of immunogenic cell death . Assessing the benefits and risks of immunotherapy in cancer . Assessment of the benefits and risks of cancer immunotherapies can be challenging, as the criteria used for conventional therapies cannot generally be extrapolated to immunotherapies . response after an initial increase in tumor burden . Combining immuno-oncology drugs and other treatments . As experience with immunotherapies in oncology accumulates, attention is turning to the possibility of combining immunotherapy with other treatment modalities . Combining different immunotherapies . Combinations of immunotherapies acting on different immune pathways offers the potential for additive or synergistic antitumor activity . Combining immunotherapy with targeted therapies . Combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy . As described above, certain forms of chemotherapy can sensitize tumors to immunotherapy by promoting ICD . This provided the basis for accelerated FDA approval of the chemo-immunotherapy combination for patients with untreated advanced NSCLC . Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy . Although this effect is not sufficient to overcome immune tolerance in cancer cells, the combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy may be beneficial . 
Patients with mild acute pancreatitis (AP) (65% of cases) have an uneventful disease course, with initial severe pain that improves quickly . In general terms, these patients are easily managed . In contrast, patients with moderate-to-severe AP may be challenging: they may require aggressive fluid resuscitation and they have prolonged pain and sometimes intolerance to oral refeeding . These patients may develop organ failure (OF) and be prone to late complications . This chapter addresses the early management of AP, focusing on the evidence underpinning each intervention . For this reason, monitoring patients to enable early detection of OF is particularly important . In general terms, likely causes of OF in AP include the following . Respiratory failure is the most frequent form of OF associated with AP . Urine output is especially important for the early detection of renal failure and patients in need of aggressive fluid resuscitation . There is no specific treatment for OF in AP . With no effective pharmacological therapies for treating AP, early management currently relies on supportive care . Fluid resuscitation is considered a cornerstone in the management of AP because patients have several factors that tend to decrease intravascular volume . Paralytic ileus and local complications are associated with fluid sequestration . AP is associated with vascular leak syndrome (increased systemic vascular permeability with extravasation of fluids and protein into tissues), which further increases fluid sequestration . Each patient therefore has different fluid requirements . Hypovolemia and fluid sequestration are associated with the severity of AP, so patients with mild disease may have little or no fluid sequestration, but local and systemic complications (which define moderate-to-severe AP) are closely linked to it . Fluid rate and volume . In 1998, a case-control study compared hematocrit among patients with necrotizing versus mild AP . The authors suggested that hemoconcentration was the cause of pancreatic necrosis through impaired pancreatic blood flow and recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation to improve outcomes in all patients with AP . In the following decade, guidelines and reviews addressing AP recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation as the standard of care . In both trials, the more aggressive approach was associated with worse outcomes, including decreased survival . These studies suggested that vigorous resuscitation is dangerous in patients with severe AP . Currently, it is clear that fluid volumes and rates need to be tailored to individual patient requirements . Fluid type . For the time being, it seems that lactated Ringer's solution is a good choice for fluid resuscitation in AP . Opioids are widely used for the management of pain in AP . However, specific studies are lacking . Epidural analgesia is an option for managing refractory pain and in patients with severe disease . Some observational studies suggest that it may improve outcomes and RCTs are currently being performed comparing epidural versus conventional analgesia in AP . Oral refeeding and nutritional support . Almost all patients with AP initially suffer abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and in most cases of mild AP these symptoms are the only impediments to oral refeeding . In moderate-to-severe disease, several factors influence the reintroduction of oral feeding and the need for nutritional support . Local complications may be associated with early satiety and/or gastric outlet obstruction in a small proportion of patients . Moderate-to-severe AP seems associated with hypermetabolism and negative nitrogen balance with negative energy balance . Patients with persistent OF are usually sedated, so oral refeeding is not possible . Nutrition in mild AP . Therefore, oral refeeding in patients with mild AP should be initiated after pain has resolved . Nutrition in moderate-to-severe disease . As a consequence, parenteral nutrition was considered a standard of care in patients with predicted severe disease . In the 1990s, several RCTs compared nasojejunal tube-based enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition in patients with predicted severe AP . The study showed that on-demand oral feeding was not associated with worse outcomes, and only 31% of patients needed a nasojejunal tube . Early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography . Patients with AP and acute cholangitis may benefit from early ERCP, as the first studies (those showing better outcomes for early ERCP) included patients with this complication . 
Starting treatment . What is the chance of recurrence? . What are the potential adverse effects of treatment? . After a single seizure . After more than one seizure . An informed choice . Reasons for taking prophylactic therapy should be discussed at the outset . Similarly, the regulations regarding driving should be raised and documented . The importance of total compliance with medication should also be stressed . These issues often require further emphasis at subsequent visits . The provision of written material can be a useful way to ensure that nothing important has been overlooked . Principles of drug selection . The issues discussed below should be included in the decision-making process . It is therefore also likely to be more cost-effective . Efficacy and tolerability . AED effectiveness is a function of efficacy and tolerability . Titration and monitoring . An additional benefit of a cautious approach is that it allows the development of tolerance to sedation or cognitive impairment . These ranges should be regarded, therefore, purely as a guide to prescribing . This can be a particular problem with LTG . Certain epilepsy syndromes have been found to be particularly responsive to specific therapeutic agents . The recommendations are based on the current literature and UK and US treatment guidelines . There is a possible small benefit of CBZ over VPA for partial seizures . Side effects . Safety concerns include idiosyncratic reactions, long-term complications and teratogenicity . Drug labeling has been amended by manufacturers accordingly . TPM and ZNS, on the other hand, often produce weight loss . LEV can particularly produce emotional agitation and aggression . An association with facial clefts has been reported with TPM . Cognitive impairment may occur in children who were exposed to VPA in utero . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . For instance, VPA has traditionally been used in bipolar affective disorder . It is also effective prophylaxis for migraine, an indication for which TPM has also been approved . LTG has been licensed for bipolar disorder . Bone health . Both enzyme-inducing and non-enzyme-inducing agents are implicated, and the effects may be additive . They should be advised against smoking and excessive intake of alcohol or caffeine, all of which can exacerbate bone loss . Risk factors for osteoporosis include . prolonged AED therapy . exposure to multiple drugs . a non-ambulatory lifestyle . concomitant corticosteroid therapy . People at risk are advised to take calcium and vitamin D supplements and undergo regular DEXA scans . The number of possible two-drug regimens is growing rapidly . Some useful combinations are listed in Table 4.8 . Drug-resistant epilepsy . security of the diagnosis . accuracy of the seizure and/or syndrome classification . results of brain imaging . compliance with medication . the presence of negative lifestyle factors, such as erratic sleeping habits or covert alcohol or drug abuse . Data to guide further pharmacological management are lacking . In short, they will have a better chance of fulfilling their potential . Eventually, many patients can have their medication withdrawn and remain in remission . Some patients do not equate taking medication with normal health . There are no data to guide the length of the seizure-free period . In children, 2 years of seizure freedom is reasonable before considering AED withdrawal . Even complex partial seizures can disappear after a long period of freedom from seizures . The highest probability of remaining seizure free can be seen in patients with the following characteristics . seizure free for many years . normal neurological examination . no structural lesion on brain imaging . There are no standard protocols defining optimal regimens for tapering medication . Most specialists advise slow reduction by increments over at least 6 months . Referral to a specialist . Often, they do not have direct access to the necessary investigational techniques . Dose adjustments can be undertaken later by the primary care physician . The patient should be referred back to the epilepsy specialist if . treatment causes significant side effects . a pregnancy is being planned . he or she is considering stopping therapy . 
The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) each present their own therapeutic challenges, and treatment should be tailored to the individual . However, the following principles apply to the management of all MPNs . low-dose aspirin should be considered unless contraindicated . cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or dyslipidemia should be treated aggressively, and smoking cessation actively promoted . Aims of treatment . Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is characterized by vascular features, including both thrombosis and paradoxical bleeding . Stratification of treatment according to risk . As described in Chapter 3, the risk of thrombosis in ET is assessed on the basis of age and previous history of thrombosis . The choice of treatment depends on the patient's risk level . Low-risk patients with JAK2 mutations, or cardiovascular risk factors in the absence of JAK2 mutations, should perhaps be treated with aspirin . The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the management of ET are summarized in Figure 4.3 . Management of low-risk patients . Smoking cessation should be actively promoted because cigarette smoking has been shown to be an independent risk factor for thrombosis in patients with ET . Higher doses of aspirin (up to 500 mg daily) may be required in patients with acute erythromelalgia . Management of high-risk patients . First-line treatment . Hydroxyurea should be considered as first-line therapy, aiming to achieve a normal platelet count . The rationale for this comes from a landmark randomized trial in which the addition of hydroxyurea to aspirin significantly reduced the incidence of thrombotic events, from 24% to approximately 4% (p = 0.05) . Adverse events associated with hydroxyurea include neutropenia, macrocytic anemia, fever and mucocutaneous events such as skin lesions (including skin cancer) and leg ulcers . IFN may be considered as first-line therapy in younger patients (< 65 years) and in certain situations, such as pregnancy (see Chapter 8), but toxicity is a potential concern . The most common adverse events are fevers and flu-like symptoms . Anagrelide (see below) is also approved as first-line therapy in some countries . Second-line treatment . Furthermore, compared with hydroxyurea, anagrelide was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological and constitutional adverse events . Anagrelide is frequently used in combination with hydroxyurea and is generally well tolerated in this setting . These studies highlight a risk of bleeding when anagrelide is combined with aspirin . Busulfan can cause prolonged pancytopenia and must therefore be used with caution; it is often given as either a single bolus or a short course of 1-2 weeks, or for several weeks until the blood count begins to fall . The efficacy of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in ET has recently been investigated in the MAJIC trial, which involved 110 patients with refractory disease or who were intolerant of hydroxyurea . After 1 year, there was no significant difference in complete response rates with ruxolitinib and best available therapy (46.6% versus 44.2%, respectively, p = 0.40) . Similarly, rates of thrombosis, bleeding and transformation at 2 years did not differ between the groups . Moreover, ruxolitinib was associated with higher rates of grade 3/4 anemia and thrombocytopenia . Management of extreme thrombocytosis . Extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1000 x 10 /L) may be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome, signs of which are present in most patients with ET or PV . Aspirin should be used with caution because of the increased risk of bleeding . It is recommended that such patients are screened for ristocetin cofactor activity (a measure of von Willebrand factor function), and withdrawal of aspirin considered if this activity is less than 30% . A platelet count above 15 000 x 10 /L is regarded as an indication for treatment . Recognizing treatment failure . It is important to recognize developing resistance to standard therapy - hydroxyurea in particular - because of an increased risk of disease transformation . 
Effect on development of prostate cancer . Diet and lifestyle are clearly linked to the development of prostate cancer . The effects of obesity and a western-style diet as risk factors for the development of prostate cancer were mentioned in Chapter 1 . A large number of studies have evaluated the effects of dietary manipulation/supplementation in reducing the incidence of prostate cancer; the current evidence is summarized in Table 2.1 . Although randomized clinical trials have provided some indication that selenium and vitamin E have a protective effect, a large chemoprevention study (the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]), designed to determine whether they reduced the likelihood of prostate cancer when used singly or in combination, was ended prematurely because of disappointingly negative results . Cohort studies show that lycopene (in tomatoes) and isoflavonoids (found in soy products) may be associated with a decrease in the incidence of prostate cancer . Evidence for other dietary supplements is weak . A recently published but slightly dubious cohort study on risk factors for prostate cancer reported that having more than seven sexual partners increased the risk by 100%, and having more than five orgasms per month increased the risk by 59% . However, there is no evidence that reducing these factors reverses the risk! . Chemoprevention refers to the use of drugs to reduce the risk of cancer . The 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride has been shown to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer by 24.8% compared with placebo over a 7-year period, although at the cost of a small but significant increase in sexual side effects . However, this is counterbalanced by the finding that a small proportion of cancers in the finasteride group tended to be more aggressive than those in the placebo group, although this may have been an artifact of taking biopsies from the smaller prostates in the active treatment arm resulting from the shrinkage effect of finasteride . A 2013 study reported that there was no difference in the overall survival (OS) rate, or survival after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, between the placebo-treated and finasteride-treated patients after 18 years of follow-up . Another 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, has been evaluated for its effect on the occurrence of prostate cancer in the REDUCE study (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) . Dutasteride resulted in a 23% reduction in the development of prostate cancer, mainly by suppressing the well-differentiated cancers, with only a slight (statistically insignificant) increase in Gleason pattern 7 or 8-10 poorly differentiated tumors . It also effectively treated the symptoms arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . Neither of these compounds were approved by the regulatory authorities for chemoprevention . Statins have also been reported to have some chemopreventative properties although the evidence is weak and conflicting: a recent review found that only eight of 43 studies reported a positive association between statin use and a reduction in the development or progression of prostate cancer . Effect on progression . Very few trials have investigated the effect of diet and lifestyle change on prostate cancer progression . Table 2.2 outlines the current body of evidence . It must be remembered that cardiovascular disease is still the primary cause of death in men, with or without prostate cancer, and heart-healthy lifestyle choices will reduce mortality in men with prostate cancer . These include improving lipid profiles, decreasing obesity and increasing physical fitness . A healthy diet and regular vigorous exercise may help protect the individual against various forms of cancer, in addition to decreasing the risk of death from cardiovascular causes . Evidence for a beneficial effect of exercise on prostate cancer-specific mortality is also increasing, and post-diagnosis recreational activity has been shown to significantly lower prostate cancer-specific mortality . The mechanism many not be merely related to decreased sedentary activity, however, as there was no association between sedentary activity and increased mortality . 
The biliary and pancreatic ducts . The main pancreatic duct joins the bile duct to form the common channel or ampulla of Vater (also known as the major papilla) . In 90% of people, the embryonic dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts are fused to form this pancreatic duct, meeting in the head of the pancreas . In the other 10%, the ducts drain separately into the duodenum (pancreas divisum) and the dorsal duct (known as the accessory duct) drains through the minor papilla . Small sphincters around the ends of the main bile and pancreatic ducts control the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, respectively; the sphincter of Oddi controls the outflow from the ampulla of Vater . The gallbladder is tucked under the right liver lobe in the gallbladder fossa and is connected via the cystic duct to the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct . Bile acids, essential for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, are made in the liver and travel in canaliculi to reach the bile ducts . The intrahepatic bile ducts drain into the right and left hepatic ducts, which fuse to form the common hepatic duct . Epidemiology of biliary tract disease . Gallstones are prevalent worldwide and are a considerable cause of morbidity and mortality . They may cause acute biliary colic, acute cholecystitis or chronic cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis or cholangitis . Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and the most common GI cancer in Native Americans . Incidence and mortality are very high in certain Latin American countries, especially Chile . Of the most commonly seen GI cancers in the USA, Europe and Australia, gallbladder cancer is the least common compared with other parts of the world . In most EU countries (with similar trends in the USA and Australia), mortality rates for gallbladder cancer have declined by approximately 30% among women and 10% among men, but mortality is still high in central and eastern Europe . Bile duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, may arise in the intra- or the extrahepatic biliary system, usually in people between 50 and 70 years of age . Sclerosing cholangitis affecting the biliary system may occur in association with diseases such as ulcerative colitis and in secondary form due to conditions such as AIDS . The gallbladder and the biliary system may also be affected by dyskinetic conditions such as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and gallbladder dyskinesia . The pancreas . The pancreas is the shape of a small flat fish, 6-8 inches long and salmon pink in color . It lies behind the stomach, stretching between the duodenum on the right, to the center of the spleen (hilum) on the left (Figure 1.1) . It is conventionally divided into the head, uncinate process, neck, body and tail . The pancreas is important for the production of . digestive enzymes - from the acinar cells . bicarbonate - from the duct cells (to neutralize gastric acid) . insulin - from the cells of the islets of Langerhans (essential for glucose control) . Epidemiology of pancreatic disease . In the year 2000 there were 1.15 million patients with non-malignant pancreatic disease in the USA . Each year 125 000 North Americans present with acute pancreatitis, 100 000 present with chronic pancreatitis and at least 45 000 die from diseases of the pancreas . Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal cancer and ranks fourth among cancer-related deaths in the USA . In a study of a well-defined German population, the incidence rates for acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer per 100 000 inhabitants/year were found to be 19.7, 6.4 and 7.8 respectively . For acute pancreatitis, the highest incidence rates are in the USA and Finland . The incidence rate in Finland is 73.4 cases per 100 000 people . Similar incidence rates have been reported for Australia . 
Several specific issues arise in the assessment of older brain tumor patients (Table 12.1) . The number of patients taking multiple (five or more) medications is highest among those aged 65 and older . Nutritional status is often poor in the elderly and may merit assessment . Social considerations such as marital status, income and housing are equally important and have been shown to influence treatment decisions in older cancer patients . Glioblastoma occurs most often in people 65-84 years of age . Several studies have shown that the likelihood of receiving surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy decreases with age; however, older patients with glioblastoma can benefit from combination therapy . Surgical resection of glioblastoma may extend survival and improve quality of life in older patients who are in good health . Radiotherapy extends survival over best supportive care in older patients with glioblastoma . It may be reasonable to use a modified radiotherapy regimen in some older patients . Several studies suggest that a shortened course of radiotherapy delivered over 2-3 weeks has efficacy similar to that of the standard 6-week regimen and this may have practical benefits for some patients . Temozolomide is currently approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma and is started during radiotherapy . The trial leading to approval of temozolomide excluded patients over the age of 70 . However, several studies have now shown that temozolomide is effective in older patients both in terms of tumor response and extended survival . However, there may be an increase in acute toxicity in older patients . Also, older patients receiving temozolomide during radiotherapy may have treatment-induced neurological decline . Several studies suggest that this drug may be particularly effective in older glioblastoma patients and merits further study . The current recommended standard of care for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimen followed by consolidative whole-body radiotherapy in select patients (see Chapter 10) . However, in the elderly patient, concern is often raised about the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate . Delayed neurotoxicity has been described as a consequence of whole-body radiotherapy following high-dose methotrexate, particularly in older patients, which raises a concern about appropriate use in the elderly . The major limiting toxicity of high-dose methotrexate is renal toxicity . Several studies have specifically looked at delivering high-dose methotrexate to elderly patients with PCNSL (Table 12.2) . Radiographic response rates of 90% or higher have been described and one study showed no difference in acute toxicity associated with methotrexate in older patients . Elderly patients with PCNSL treated with whole-body radiotherapy as consolidation following methotrexate have a significant risk of delayed neurotoxicity - estimated to be as high as 90% . This syndrome is characterized by progressive cognitive decline that begins within months of completing whole-body radiotherapy . Most patients require assistance with activities of daily living and have a poor quality of life . There is no effective therapy for this syndrome . Recognition of the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate and treatment-related neurotoxicity has led to the recommendation that whole-body radiotherapy should be avoided for elderly patients, and that methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone should be used as standard treatment . Results from specific studies of the elderly are not available to guide treatment for most other brain tumors . Older patients who are healthy with limited comorbidities and full function should be offered the standard of care . Those patients with moderate comorbidities and/or limited independence should be considered for standard treatment with possible modifications to limit side effects . Geriatric neuro-oncology . Population studies suggest that increasing age is often associated with decreasing treatment . While this may be appropriate for some elderly patients, other patients over the age of 65 remain in excellent health with a good quality of life and the potential to respond to appropriate treatment . Recent advances in the management of brain tumors raise a number of issues for older patients . First, older patients are often underrepresented in those clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of a new therapy and thus it is not known if the same benefit can be expected in the geriatric population . Finally, the assessment of long-term toxicity associated with new therapies is often limited at the time of initial development and may present differently in older patients . 
Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder . Adjustment disorder . Although features vary, they include one or a combination of depressed mood, anxiety or worry . The effects do not persist beyond a 6-month period, and the precipitating stressful event does not include bereavement . Bipolar disorder . The individual may therefore not get the correct treatment for bipolar disorder (mood stabilizing medication) over this time . The treatment of bipolar depression is different from that of major depression . The response to antidepressants is poor and there is the risk of 'switching' to an episode of mania or hypomania . For this reason, it is generally recommended that any antidepressant medication is accompanied by a mood stabilizer . In bipolar II disorder, the person experiences an episode of hypomania rather than mania . Additionally, at least one major depressive episode must have been experienced . Although the diagnostic criteria specify a short minimum duration of elevated mood, this usually lasts for between 2 weeks and 5 months, with a median duration of around 4 months . See also Fast Facts: Bipolar Disorder . Problems defining depression . It is characterized by low mood and the absence of positive affect (id est loss of interest and enjoyment in everyday activities), together with a range of emotional, cognitive, physical and behavioral features . There are then fundamental problems in the notion of depression as a psychiatric disorder . Defining the boundaries of depression . The validity of the concept of depression is questioned on a number of counts . Depression, like most psychiatric disorders, is defined by its symptom profile . Rather than being based on 'hard' criteria related to a clear causal mechanism, with associated biological markers, this differentiation is based on clinical characteristics . Delineating depression from other mental disorders . In the community, as well as in primary care settings, the most prevalent mood disorder is a combination of depression and anxiety . The benefit of defining depression . It is inconceivable that these activities could persist in the absence of clear criteria for this condition based on the presence of particular symptoms . A consensus exists that the many benefits of applying the classification system for depression, as for other psychiatric conditions, outweigh the disadvantages . There is a consensus concerning the symptoms of depression . The criteria used by these classification systems are broadly similar, although the symptom thresholds differ . Major depressive disorder . Single episode or recurrent . A generation ago, standard psychiatry texts typically considered depression as an acute illness best managed by specialist treatment . Severity is clarified from the number and intensity of symptoms, with categorization as shown in Table 2.2 . Psychotic features . The presence of psychotic symptoms is a strong indication that specialist multiprofessional management is required, possibly including inpatient assessment and treatment . Melancholic features . Melancholia used to be known as 'endogenous' depression . It is an important subtype of depression as it has a more neurobiological basis and requires pharmacological treatment . There is a pattern of the depressed mood that is substantially worse in the morning (diurnal variation) . Sleep is disturbed, with the person waking early in the morning and being unable to get back to sleep . Psychomotor retardation or agitation is likely to be pronounced, and significant appetite and weight loss and excessive or inappropriate guilt are characteristic of this subtype . In DSM-5, the diagnostic features include anhedonia and non-reactivity along with at least three of the following . distinct quality of depressed mood . depression worse in the morning . early morning awakening . marked psychomotor change . significant anorexia or weight loss . excessive or inappropriate guilt . Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) occurs when depression recurrences follow a seasonal pattern . DSM-5 criteria for this particular pattern of recurrent major depressive disorder specify that . depressive episodes occur repeatedly at a particular time of the year . remissions between episodes occur at a particular time of the year . Although the geographic distribution of SAD has not been rigorously studied, evidence suggests that SAD is more prevalent in northern latitudes . The validity of SAD is less well accepted in Europe than in the USA, and the ICD-10 has only provisional criteria for research . Around 10-15% of women may be affected . Persistent depressive disorder . 
The chronic complications of diabetes mellitus are shown in Table 9.1 . Indirect costs related to reduced productivity, early retirement, absenteeism etc . appeared to stand at €98.4 billion, thus actually exceeding direct costs . Diabetic neuropathy . The precise cause of diabetic neuropathy is not completely understood . Acute painful neuropathy . Fortunately, this type of neuropathy is relatively uncommon . Fortunately, most individuals recover spontaneously within a year . Good glycemic control is important to achieve this . The onset is usually gradual but it may, in certain cases, be abrupt .

Only 16% of this large cohort proceeded to stem cell transplantation . Treatment options . For these patients the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend either multi- or single-agent chemotherapy for salvage . Patients who are not candidates for transplant should receive single-agent therapy to provide palliative benefit with minimal toxicity . Gemcitabine-based regimens have also shown activity, including GDP, GVD and GemOx . Single agents . All patients also received vitamin B12 injections every 2 months and folic acid daily .

HF is a disease of inappropriate adaptation to injury . The body has a limited range of compensatory responses to circulatory impairment, mainly vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention (see below) . In general, however, these adjustments to hypovolemia are poorly suited to pump failure, and increases in the preload and afterload of the failing heart lead to worsening HF (Figure 2.1) . Neurohormonal pathways activated in HF include the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the natriuretic peptide (NP) system . Sympathetic nervous system . Sympathetic activation of the adrenergic system leads to vasoconstriction, which increases the resistance to blood flow and helps to maintain arterial pressure in the early stages of HF when cardiac output is reduced . However, vasoconstriction also increases the afterload on the heart, leading to a worsening of HF (see Figure 2.1) . Enhanced sympathetic outflow also activates the RAAS (Figure 2.2) . Angiotensin II causes systemic vasoconstriction and acts on the adrenal cortex to produce aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention . Sympathetic stimulation also releases antidiuretic hormone, which leads to retention of free water and contributes to dilutional hyponatremia . Natriuretic peptide system . NPs, mainly BNP, lead to increased sodium excretion and vasodilation, especially in the early phases of HF . BNP also has anti-remodeling properties . It is postulated that HF is a state of relative BNP deficiency caused by both lack of biologically active peptide and resistance at a receptor level . In end-stage HF, the peptides may not be released because of myocyte loss . Other pathways also reflect an inappropriate response to injury . Cytokine release is increased in HF, leading to a variety of consequences including apoptosis . The role of these as contributors to the progression of HF, rather than a correlate, is debated . Global and local responses to maladaptive stimuli lead to myocardial remodeling, namely increased myocardial volume and mass and a net loss of myocytes . This is not a response that can keep occurring indefinitely - eventually a loss of LV function will occur due to reduced interaction between contractile elements, caused by their separation . The increase of sympathetic tone associated with HF leads to disturbance of the autonomic reflexes . Insulin resistance is an important metabolic sequel to HF . It contributes to the disturbance of myocyte energy metabolism, leading to the description of the failing heart as 'an engine out of fuel' . Causes of insulin resistance include the underlying etiologies of HF (central obesity, diabetes mellitus) and loss of skeletal muscle (see below) . Peripheral vasoconstriction, as described above, symptomatically may contribute to cold sensitivity . Loss of skeletal muscle is an important manifestation of HF, reflecting inactivity, consequences of circulating substances such as tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta and reduced cardiac output . In its most advanced manifestation, loss of skeletal muscle may lead to cachexia . The consequences of this process include contributions to insulin resistance as well as loss of the skeletal muscle circulatory bed . Reduced renal perfusion in HF (due to reduced stroke volume and vasoconstriction) is an important contributor to sodium and fluid overload . More marked disturbances of renal function, leading to coexisting renal failure, may also occur and pose problems for volume control . Clinical stages and functional classes . The clinical syndrome of HF represents the final manifestation of advanced disease . It is important to distinguish these from functional classes, as described in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which is based on severity of symptoms and exercise capacity and can be used to assess response to treatment (see Table 2.1) . ACC/AHA stages A and B are preclinical; these patients fall into NYHA functional class I . ACC/AHA stage C reflects patients with symptoms or signs of HF, so these patients may be classified functionally in any of the NYHA classes I to III . The functional status of patients in ACC/AHA class D (with marked symptoms and signs of HF) is usually limited (NYHA class II to IV) . The association between functional class, cardiac function (LVEF) and prognosis is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9 . 
Discussion with patient . A summary of the questions frequently asked by patients are shown in Table 8.1 . It is important to reassure patients that acne is common, will not last forever, and that effective treatment is available . Myths about the disease should be dispelled in a frank and thorough discussion with the patient . For example, certain foods do not cause acne, acne is not infectious and excessive washing does not help manage the disease (see Table 8.1) . Inform about treatment duration and response . It should be stressed that acne is a chronic disease and that no response will be seen before a minimum of 4 weeks of therapy . Patients must be informed of the potential duration of treatment . For mild disease, topical treatment may be required for up to 4 years . Treatment with oral isotretinoin may last for 6-12 months according to the severity of the disease and the clinical response of the patient . It is important that patients receive clear instructions on how to use their treatment, and are made aware of the potential side effects . Such information is helpful, but is not a substitute for an adequate discussion with the patient . Choosing the right treatment . For this reason, combination therapy is the mainstay of acne treatment . Early treatment of acne is likely, although not proven, to prevent or modify development of the disease; thus, early use of appropriate topical therapy in mild acne (see below) may well prevent development of moderate acne . Mild acne . In general, 40-80% of patients with non-inflammatory or mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne respond to topical therapy; this minimizes potential adverse effects associated with the use of systemic agents . Moderate acne . For these reasons, combining topical and oral antibiotics is not recommended . Oral antibiotics . Second-generation tetracycline antibiotics (see pages 59-64) should be the systemic treatment of choice for those patients who can tolerate them . Patients who crush their tablets because they are unable to swallow entire pills may not absorb an adequate amount of antibiotic . acnes resistance but development of resistance to oral tetracyclines is a potential problem in patients with acne . Resistance should be suspected if a patient's acne fails to respond, or improves then worsens after 3 months of treatment . Moderate-to-severe acne . Hormonal therapy is indicated in moderate papulopustular, nodular and conglobate acne in female patients . Expected response . Patients can expect to experience some clinical response after 3 months and the full effect of contraceptives after 6-9 months of treatment . Patients should be given immediate access to a dermatologist if any problem with therapy arises or if they fail to respond adequately to the drug . Expected response . By the end of an adequate course of treatment, acne will have cleared in the majority of patients . acnes has been detected on an international scale (Table 8.3) . Preventing resistance . The advised length of treatment is 12 weeks . Antibiotics should not be used in the maintenance phase of therapy . acnes resistance should be suspected in patients who are not responding, patients who were responding but have relapsed, and those who have had 2-3 courses of different topical and oral antibiotics . Suspected resistant P . Poor response to therapy . The major reasons for poor response to conventional antibiotic therapy are outlined in Table 8.6 . Patients can be motivated to adhere to prescribed regimens with some simple explanations and encouragement . At the start of treatment, acne can appear to worsen . It is important to explain why a specific treatment was selected, and to suggest ways in which the treatment can be incorporated into the patient's lifestyle and routines . acnes strains in another follicle may be resistant to antibiotic, therefore requiring higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotic . acnes in about 25% of patients is clinically relevant . patients who may require treatment with isotretinoin for . severe inflammatory, nodulocystic or scarring acne . patients whose acne may be associated with an endocrine disorder . patients with social or psychological problems . patients with, or who are likely to develop, acne scarring . pregnant patients with acne . patients with moderate acne that has failed to respond to treatment . 
Several clinical scenarios occur in bladder cancer . Five-year survival is about 35% . Lymph node involvement is identified through lymph node dissection or accurate imaging . The primary cancer may still be amenable to local therapy, and is potentially curable in the absence of distant metastases . Ablative local therapies such as surgery or radiation therapy should only be used to ameliorate current and potential issues that compromise quality of life . Treatment decisions usually require multidisciplinary input . A key component of such discussions should be whether participation in a clinical trial is possible and an appropriate option for the patient to consider . Systemic therapy for metastatic bladder cancer . Response rates with cisplatin monotherapy were initially reported to be as high as 40%, although subsequent studies showed that response rates of 10-15% were more realistic . Other drugs such as paclitaxel and gemcitabine were also subsequently shown to have activity as monotherapies . CMV and MVAC have been the mainstay of chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial bladder cancer for many years . The study was somewhat ambitiously designed to demonstrate a 33% improvement in OS with GC, rather than as an equivalence or non-inferiority study . The survival curves for the two regimens were similar, and the trial did not meet its primary endpoint . GC has become the de facto standard for trials in other settings, even though this is not supported by high-level evidence . It is important to recognize when and how far we should go beyond high-level evidence when making treatment decisions with patients . Improvements in supportive care have led to renewed interest in older chemotherapy combinations . Further modifications such as the addition of a taxane to GC increased the toxicity without substantially improving outcomes and therefore are not recommended . The dosing and scheduling details of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer are summarized in Table 7.2 . Useful reviews of chemotherapy have been published by Yafi and colleagues and Oing and colleagues . Recent clinical trials have targeted a so-called 'cisplatin-ineligible' population . The criteria for this designation are rather soft and can include . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) 2 or worse . glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 mL/min . pre-existing neuropathy or ototoxicity . increased risk for neuropathy or ototoxicity (exempli gratia diabetes, alcohol misuse, occupational noise exposure) . congestive cardiac failure or other inability to manage a fluid load . However, not all these factors indicate unsuitability for cisplatin . These points need to be considered when deciding whether cisplatin is appropriate for a specific patient, and when designing clinical trials . Second and subsequent lines of chemotherapy . Tumors that have progressed after first-line chemotherapy cannot be cured with chemotherapy, and response rates are typically lower than with first-line setting . It is important to reiterate at this stage that the intent of treatment is palliative, which can often be an uncomfortable conversation . The literature contains many examples of small studies in the post-first-line setting, for both cisplatin-eligible and cisplatin-ineligible patients . Response rates with active agents range from 20% to 80% . Use of complex regimens such as doublets or triplets does not seem to improve outcomes, and toxicity is substantially worse with combinations than with monotherapy . Patients who have had good responses previously may sometimes respond well to re-challenge with the same agents . Example regimens are shown in Table 7.2 (noting that not all drugs will be available in all regions) . General principles of treatment . The general principles of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease are summarized in Table 7.3 . Palliation and best supportive care . Any treatment must provide some possibility of benefit, and this benefit should outweigh the predicted risks . It is therefore reasonable to consider surgery, radiation therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy or other active approaches within the context of supportive care and palliative intent . The financial implications of treatment may also require consideration . Many symptoms can be treated with simple and non-invasive measures, for example . detection and management of urinary tract infections . blood transfusion (with defined stopping points) . radiation therapy for symptomatic metastatic disease . 
The goal of any trial is to determine both the safety and efficacy of a new medical product . Measures within the trial process must demonstrate the product's safety and efficacy to regulators before it is allowed to be labeled and marketed for use by patients . However, measurement in clinical trials does not only inform regulatory decision-making . Additionally, measurement data from clinical trials inform reimbursement decisions, which impacts the value of the market . Trial success is not correlated with number of measures . It is much more important to select the right measures - those that are the most informative regarding the product's safety and efficacy - rather than the most measures . In fact, medical product manufacturers, regulators, patients and ethics review boards all worry about burdening participants with excessive tasks, activities and technologies . The ability of a measure to effectively and accurately operate in the wild (exempli gratia out of a patient's home and across many geographies and languages) is also a concern . Medical product manufacturers are often reluctant to assume even more risk - not just in their new product but also in a novel measure - without a substantial body of evidence . Decisions regarding the inclusion of digital measurement tools in clinical trials are complex, affect many stakeholders and require extensive consideration of factors related to the clinical implications of the measure itself . Additionally, the operational aspects of the measure and the potential effects on the trial design and participants need to be considered (Figure 8.1) . Changing clinical trials . Traditional clinical trials collect snippets of data when a participant visits the study site and represent a tiny snapshot of patients' lived experience with a disease or condition . Decentralized clinical trials . Digital tools enable new forms of research such as decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), which are conducted outside of the clinic to capture data about a study participant in their day-to-day life (Figure 8.2) . DCTs have a number of potential benefits, including faster participant recruitment, improved participant retention in the trial, greater control and convenience for participants, increased diversity (exempli gratia because it is easier to enroll in the first place) and trial results that are more generalizable . Two features of data collection determine how 'decentralized' a clinical trial is: where and how the data are collected . Where are data collected? In traditional clinical trials, drugs, devices and therapies are administered in a clinic or research hospital . In newer direct-to-patient or remote trials, participant data are collected in the home or in the study participant's natural environment . How are the data collected? In the past, most data were collected via an intermediary - someone from the team would record information in a custom software system and/or case report form . As digital tools advance, we can collect more endpoint-supporting data at home via digital surveys and sensors, and study teams can 'visit' patients at home via telemedicine conference calls . This means that more of the data are participant-generated and collected 'virtually', without an intermediary . A doctor who remote teleconferences with a patient would be conducting a 'remote trial', but they might collect the data manually through a survey, so the study would not be considered a 'virtual trial' . In contrast, a study team might collect all the data passively from a smartwatch in a clinic, and this study would be a 'virtual trial' from a data collection perspective, but not a 'remote trial' because the patient is in a centralized location . As a new field emerges, so does a new vocabulary . What are real-world data? . Real world is a term that is important to define as it is often misused . The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) . These data sources include electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile technologies . Real-world evidence is the evidence derived from real-world data . In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute real-world data . However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial . 
This is a major issue in the case of lymphoma because of the different subtypes, many of which respond differently to a given treatment modality . Advances in cellular and molecular techniques have revolutionized our understanding of lymphoma as a disease and have paved the way for improved diagnosis and treatment . Clinical presentation . Lymphomas may present in one of two principal ways . Most lymphomas present as a simple lump - an enlarged lymph node, usually within a nodal group such as the neck or the axilla or groin, but other lymphomas may present as an urgent problem involving critical organs . The presentation can be quite variable because lymphoma may affect any organ . A lymphoma that affects the stomach or bowel may present as abdominal pain, perforation, bleeding or obstruction . However, a lymphoma that heavily infiltrates the bone marrow may lead to a life-threatening pancytopenia (reduction in circulating blood cells) . Occasionally, lymphomas will give rise to autoimmune phenomena, such as hemolysis or peripheral neuropathy . The histological appearance of a tissue section obtained at biopsy is essential for lymphoma diagnosis . Hodgkin versus non-Hodgkin lymphoma . The pathological distinction between these two types of lymphoma is usually relatively straightforward, based on histology and immunophenotyping (see below) . Lymphomas can then be further subdivided into distinct entities based on the characteristic morphology, immunophenotype and cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities (Figure 3.5) . Cells expressing the protein of interest will therefore stain brown (Figure 3.6) . Flow cytometry and immunophenotyping can be used to establish the following characteristics of any particle or cell . complexity (for a cell this means its granularity) . surface characteristics (for a cell this means the proteins expressed on the cell surface) . A flow cytometer is capable of analyzing cells one at a time provided the cells are in a fluid phase . Each blood or lymph-node cell scatters a beam of light from a laser in two different ways (Figure 3.7): the forward scattering reflects the size of the cell and the sideways scattering reflects the granularity of the cell . The process of using antibodies to define the phenotype of a cell is called immunophenotyping . The immunophenotypes of normal mature T cells and B cells are listed in Table 3.1 . disease subtype . Disease subtype . Identification of the specific lymphoma type is complex . Almost all lymphomas express the leukocyte common antigen CD45, which defines the tumor as being of hemopoietic origin . Cytogenetics is the study of chromosomes . In hematologic disorders, including lymphomas, abnormalities in both the number and structure of chromosomes are associated with malignant cells . Karyotyping is conducted on cells in the metaphase (id est the stage in the cell cycle when the cell is about to divide) . Cells for analysis are obtained from a blood sample, or a bone-marrow or lymph-node biopsy . The nucleus of the cell is made to swell, enabling a more detailed look at the chromosomes . Each chromosome has a distinct banding pattern enabling identification . However, such changes are usually non-specific . This is particularly so for interphase FISH, which does not require cell growth . An example in mantle cell lymphoma is shown in Figure 3.11 . Molecular genetic techniques . In lymphoma, the major impact so far has been in subtyping cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . This group of lymphomas is likely to represent several different entities with distinct epidemiological and etiologic factors . The first group has a gene-expression signature that suggests the cells have originated from a germinal-center B cell (see page 19) . This group is therefore called germinal-center B-cell (GCB) type and has a relatively good 5-year survival rate . The second group is rather more heterogeneous and is often termed the activated B-cell (ABC) type . These lymphomas have a significantly worse 5-year survival rate . A correct diagnosis is very important, however, as the chemotherapy regimens used to treat the two disorders differ greatly . Tissue microarrays . 
Intra-articular corticosteroids . Synthetic corticosteroids are excellent anti-inflammatory agents . It is assumed that the analgesic efficacy of corticosteroids is related to their anti-inflammatory actions, although this has not been clearly demonstrated . Most studies have focused on knee OA, but a 2016 systematic review supports similar benefit in patients with hip OA . Hip injections should always be given under imaging guidance . Such guidance may be of benefit for some knee and hand injections as well . who need sufficient pain relief to perform appropriate strengthening exercises . with a large knee effusion that interferes with function . with a ruptured Baker's cyst (see pages 60 -) . To facilitate exercise . Most commonly, steroid injections are administered as a pain 'circuit-breaker' to allow appropriate exercises to be performed . Patients are usually able to start exercise of the joint a few days after the injection . Large knee effusion . Ruptured Baker's cyst . The major differential diagnosis is that of a deep venous thrombosis . As most Baker's cysts communicate with the knee joint cavity, intra-articular steroid into the knee joint often reduces fluid production and leakage from the cyst . Direct aspiration and injection of the cyst under imaging guidance can also be considered . Number of injections . A general rule of no more than three or four injections in a given year is often quoted . Injection technique . Intra-articular injections are usually performed using an aseptic technique . They should only be undertaken under the supervision of, and after training from, a physician with expertise in the appropriate techniques . Ultrasound guidance improves injection accuracy and, potentially, patient comfort and clinical response . Side effects . It is wise to warn patients that a flare up of joint pain may occur after injection, albeit in a small percentage of patients . This may be due to a reaction to the steroid preparation and usually settles within 24 hours . If steroid is deposited subcutaneously it can cause fat atrophy, which may cause unsightly dimples in visible areas . Again, much of this concept is based on animal studies and no good clinical evidence is available to support it . Most patients have structural damage before injection, and subsequent monitoring of structural damage in the clinic is very difficult given current radiographic imaging (this may change with MRI monitoring) . The few retrospective studies are confounded by the degree of patient symptoms and structural damage . Novel corticosteroid formulations . New formulations of existing therapies are being developed . This novel formulation demonstrated sustained analgesic benefits following a single injection through 12 weeks in phase II and III trials . The safety profile has been shown to be similar to saline-placebo . Such extended-release formulations may change how we view the use of intra-articular steroid injections in clinical practice . Intra-articular hyaluronans . Hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid; HA) is a major non-structural component of both the synovial and cartilage extracellular matrices (see Chapter 1) . It is also found in the synovial fluid . In particular, HA is generally cleared from the joint within 24 hours and any mechanism of action must therefore take into account the prolonged clinical benefits reported . Many clinical trials of HA therapy, the vast majority in OA of the knee, have been conducted . Studies suggest that this small effect may only occur in mildly arthritic knees . Practitioners must also take into account the cost-benefits of these therapies . Side effects . Occasionally, there can be local irritation around the injection site . Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for hip and knee OA have increased in popularity over the last few years . PRP is an autologous blood product with concentrated platelets that contains various growth factors and cytokines . A recent review including 15 randomized controlled trials found that these injections appear to be safe, and may provide some short-term symptomatic benefit . However, the trials were all of low to moderate quality, used a variety of different protocols and preparations of PRP, and did not assess structural benefit or harms or longer-term outcomes . To date, given the lack of high-quality evidence to support its use, PRP is not recommended in any clinical guideline .
