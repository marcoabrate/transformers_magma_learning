Larotrectinib has also been approved by the EMA . The value of assessing TMB in mBC also remains investigational . Colorectal cancer . Three major pathways of carcinogenesis have been elucidated . chromosomal instability (CIN), which accounts for around 85% of all CRCs . MSI, which accounts for around 15% of CRCs . Chromosomal instability is characterized by alterations in chromosomes 17p and 18q . The most clinically relevant pathways affected are the Wnt and MAPK pathways . Hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter can cause sporadic cancer . NGS can also be utilized to determine MSI status and allows for analysis of over 100 loci . NGS has 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity as compared with PCR . CpG island methylator phenotype . NGS testing for predictive biomarkers . Thus, guidelines require an 'extended' RAS analysis be performed . codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 . codons 59 and 61 of exon 3 . codons 117 and 146 of exon 4 . Nonetheless, a BRAF mutation is a negative prognostic indicator . NGS provides the widest genetic coverage and most cost-effective solution . Where gene chips for multiple genes are utilized, extra information may be gained . HER2 overexpression has been detected in around 3.5% of CRCs . TMB can be detected by NGS technology (see page 45) . The use of validated biomarkers and those currently being investigated is summarized in Table 5.2 . Liquid biopsy . Already, the presence of ctDNA is a predictor of relapse . The KIT mutation is associated with chronic sun damage . This agent was approved by the FDA in 2011 and by the EMA in 2012 .

The finding of high TMB is associated with higher response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors . Gastrointestinal stromal tumors . Epithelioid sarcoma . There is, however, no biomarker to guide its use . Other pathways investigated include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway . ","The molecular status of, at least, EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and BRAF must be tested in patients with advanced stage NSCLC to determine suitability for TKI therapy. PD-L1 expression also needs to be tested in patients with advanced NSCLC to guide immunotherapy decisions. Knowledge of mutations affecting KRAS, MET, RET and NTRK may also help select treatment for advanced NSCLC. Individuals with advanced breast cancer should undergo molecular testing to assess, at least, PIK3CA (ER+ mBC), germinal BRCA mutations ( HER2 âˆ’ mBC), HER2 amplification, MSI and NTRK. Knowledge of PD-L1 expression is also required to guide immunotherapy in TNBC. The utility of assessing several other genes ( ESR1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2 ) and the value of assessing TMB are currently being investigated in breast cancer. Chromosomal instability accounts for around 85% of all CRCs, while MSI accounts for around 15%. CIMP, which shows overlap with the MSI pathway, is found in around 17% of CRCs. The minimum testing required to determine whether anti-EGFR therapy may be of benefit in CRC is extended RAS testing of KRAS and NRAS: codons 12 and 13 of exon 2; codons 59 and 61 of exon 3; and codons 117 and 146 of exon 4. Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations - including BRAF, NRAS and KIT - documented in all melanoma subtypes. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations. BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma; however, these responses may be short. The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors has demonstrated improved durable response rates over a single-agent BRAF inhibitor. Mucosal or acral melanomas with activating mutations or amplifications in KIT may be sensitive to c-KIT inhibitors. The majority of GISTs have KIT mutations that result in constitutive activation of the RTK, c-KIT. TKIs have some effectiveness in GISTs and non-GI sarcomas."

It can be delivered at an individual or group level, typically for 5-20 sessions of around 40 minutes each . It focuses on current personal relationships and their effects on mood . It is derived from the Eastern meditative practice of mindfulness, combined with elements of CBT . This limits function and quality of life and is an indicator of greater risk of relapse . SSRIs together with CBT are currently the best-evaluated approach . ","The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods. Depression is complex, and understanding and helping requires a sensitive weighing up of the many factors that are relevant to the individuals and families affected. There are a range of treatments that may be effective for depression, and matching management intensity to the level of depression severity - termed 'stepped care' - is a widely adopted framework for care. For milder forms of depression, self-help, relaxation, sleep hygiene, exercise and problem-solving therapy are likely to be effective; for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants or a structured psychological treatment (cognitive-behavior therapy) is indicated; combined antidepressants and psychological therapy may be most appropriate for severe depression. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the first-choice medication but prior treatment history, medical history and drug interactions are key considerations in treatment selection."

9781908541277,ch_9,"Epilepsy surgery . Surgery should be considered for patients with drug-resistant seizures because of the increased mortality and progressive cognitive and psychosocial morbidities associated with uncontrolled seizures over many years . There is emerging consensus that once drug resistance is demonstrated, patients should be promptly referred to a specialty epilepsy center that offers surgery . In some situations, such as catastrophic epilepsy in children, patients should be referred urgently because of the risk of severe developmental disability . In addition to results of diagnostic tests, the patient's and the family's perceptions of epilepsy severity despite optimal pharmacotherapy and their expectations for the future are key determinants in the decision to operate . Types of procedure . Corpus callosotomy is a treatment option for patients with severe generalized epilepsy, particularly atonic seizures with frequent falls and subsequent injuries . A thorough review of the patient's seizure history and AED trials . Sophisticated video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, which localizes the onset of a number of seizures that are typical for the particular patient . High-quality MRI with dedicated 'epilepsy surgery protocol' to increase diagnostic accuracy . When monitoring shows that seizures arise from different sides of the brain on separate occasions, or are consistent with generalized seizures, lobectomy is unlikely to be of benefit . The introduction of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in 1997 provided a non-pharmacological approach to epilepsy treatment . The VNS Therapy (Cyberonics, Texas, USA) system has been implanted in tens of thousands of patients worldwide . VNS is approved in the USA for use as adjunctive therapy for adults and adolescents over 12 years of age whose partial-onset seizures are refractory to AEDs . The VNS system (Figure 6.4) consists of . a programmable signal generator that is implanted in the patient's left upper chest . a hand-held magnet used by the patient or carer to turn the stimulator on or off . Implantation and setup . The implantation procedure lasts approximately 1 hour with the patient under general anesthesia to minimize any possible seizure interference during surgery . Within the first 2 weeks after surgery, the output current is increased by the physician and adjusted to patient tolerance . In addition, the patient or a companion may activate the generator by placing the magnet over it for several seconds; in some patients, this may interrupt a seizure or reduce its severity if applied soon after the seizure onset . A number of severely affected patients treated with VNS have had clinically important seizure reductions of over 50%, and a few have become seizure free . Patients do not appear to become tolerant to the therapeutic effect induced by VNS . Patients may use the hand-held magnet to inhibit stimulation for side-effect management . The diet mimics the biochemical changes associated with starvation, which creates ketosis . Its exact mechanism of seizure suppression remains unclear . The diet was first developed in the 1920s but fell out of favor when the choice of AEDs on the market increased . However, interest in the diet has resurfaced since the early 1990s as it can be very effective in patients in whom numerous drug trials have failed, and it does not have the cumulative sedating effects of multiple AEDs . Patients who require tube feeding can be provided with a liquid formula prepared from commercially available dietary powders . Patients are usually admitted for several days when the diet is initiated to monitor for any early complications such as hypoglycemia, and to educate the patient and family on how to administer the diet . Close collaboration between the patient and family, managing pediatrician and specially trained dietician is essential for successful implementation of the diet . In addition, a modified version of the diet (medium-chain triglyceride diet) appears to have similar efficacy . The diet seems to be effective in all seizure types . Dehydration, diarrhea and hypoglycemia may occur at the start of the diet . Other diets, including a low glycemic index diet and modified Atkins diet, are currently under study . Over-the-counter herbal and dietary supplements are increasingly popular with people in industrialized countries, especially patients with chronic illnesses such as epilepsy . Surveys conducted in the USA and UK suggest that up to one-third of patients with epilepsy take herbal and/or dietary supplements, and that most of these patients do not discuss their herbal use with their physicians . Thus, the particular products taken by a patient may be a clue to that patient's side effects from AEDs or comorbid disorders . ","Patients should be referred for presurgical evaluation after failure of two or more regimens using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), particularly if they have a resectable lesion. Essential presurgical evaluation includes long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, MRI with a dedicated protocol, and neuropsychological assessment for language and memory functions. Most patients (70-80%) with mesial temporal sclerosis can become seizure free after anterior temporal lobectomy. Vagus nerve stimulation is a therapeutic option for patients with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures, particularly those with non-resectable seizure foci. The ketogenic diet is effective adjunctive therapy for children with drug-resistant epilepsy. The ketogenic diet should only be used under expert medical and nutritional supervision. Up to one-third of patients with epilepsy take herbal or dietary supplements for general maintenance of health or the control of symptoms such as difficulty sleeping or depression. Thus, knowledge of the products taken by the patient may provide the clinician with information on AED side effects or comorbid mood disorders. Clinicians must take a thorough history from patients regarding the use of alternative medicines, and check reliable databases for information on safety as well as possible effects on seizure frequency and serum AED concentrations."
9781910797907,chp6,"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequently used to support patients with PK deficiency, particularly during the first months of life . However, transfusion thresholds and guidelines used in other red cell disorders, such as thalassemia major or intermedia, do not necessarily apply to PK deficiency . When to transfuse . There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals . The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin . Consequently, patients may tolerate moderately severe anemia with few symptoms . When patients have a transfusion, the goal nadir hemoglobin level should also be based on symptoms rather than on a level extrapolated from guidelines used in other anemias . Many patients with PK deficiency will never need a transfusion or will only require intermittent, or unplanned, transfusions during hemolytic crises due to infections or an aplastic crisis associated with parvovirus infection . Others may remain on regular transfusion therapy until splenectomy is considered . Hemoglobin goals . As individuals age through adulthood, transfusion requirements may increase despite a stable hemoglobin, as a result of increased symptoms from the anemia, perhaps related to increased daily activity . Transfusions are associated with iron loading, and chelation therapy is necessary in patients who receive regular transfusions (see Table 5.3) . Partial splenectomy has been performed in a few patients with PK deficiency, but has not been beneficial . The benefits of splenectomy . Splenectomy partially ameliorates the anemia in most patients and is beneficial in decreasing the need for transfusions in 90% of patients . In patients who received regular transfusions before splenectomy, approximately 80% can discontinue transfusions altogether following surgery . However, in almost all patients, an incompletely compensated hemolytic process persists, in which mild anemia, reticulocytosis and indirect hyperbilirubinemia continue . Approximately 14% of patients on regular transfusions prior to splenectomy will have a poor response and will continue to require regular transfusions . Patient selection . Preoperative assessment of red cell survival, splenic sequestration and/or spleen size is of no value in selecting patients for splenectomy . Low pre-splenectomy hemoglobin levels are associated with a poorer response to splenectomy in terms of the post-splenectomy hemoglobin rise and/or transfusion burden . The burden of transfusions in PK deficiency varies between patients . The decision whether to have a splenectomy to improve the anemia of PK deficiency is complex and depends on both the physician's and the patient's perspective of the potential benefits and risks . Recent guidelines recommend splenectomy in patients who are reliant on regular transfusions or are severely anemic . Splenectomy should also be considered in patients who receive intermittent transfusions with every infectious illness or who have symptomatic anemia . The timing of splenectomy is based on the risk-benefit assessment . Splenectomy in young children is associated with an increased risk of post-splenectomy sepsis, while a delay in splenectomy in patients who receive regular transfusions is associated with increased iron loading . In the absence of a spleen, individuals are also at risk of severe babesiosis and malaria . With adequate vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics, the absolute risk of a serious infection is very low . If splenectomy is needed at an earlier age, the benefits must be balanced against the risk of infection . Vaccination schedules are frequently updated based on new information and vaccine development . It is recommended that all vaccines are given at least 2 weeks before splenectomy . Oral antibiotics for infection prophylaxis are indicated after splenectomy . Many studies demonstrate an overall increased risk of thrombosis after splenectomy, including in otherwise healthy individuals . Although the etiology for the increased risk is not clear, some physicians recommend taking low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after splenectomy, particularly in patients with marked thrombocytosis, to potentially decrease this risk . With the reticulocytosis associated with PK deficiency, folic acid needs are increased . Supplemental folic acid may be needed, depending on the patient's dietary folic acid intake . ","The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors. The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. Some patients with PK deficiency may tolerate a lower level of hemoglobin than those with other anemias due to increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Splenectomy is beneficial in increasing the hemoglobin level and decreasing the need for transfusions in most patients with PK deficiency. Given the potential risks associated with splenectomy, physicians should participate in shared decision making with their patients to determine whether to pursue splenectomy and at what age. The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis in PK deficiency is similar (approximately 10%) to other non-malignant hematologic conditions."

Complex partial seizures typically last less than several minutes . Patients cannot remember behaving in this manner . If restrained, they may become hostile or aggressive . This postictal state can last from minutes to hours . Absence seizures (previously called 'petit mal') mainly affect children . Typical absence seizures usually last 5-10 seconds, commonly in clusters . They manifest as sudden onset of staring and impaired consciousness, with or without eye blinking and lip smacking . They last longer than typical absence seizures and are often associated with changes in muscle tone . Myoclonic seizures consist of sudden brief muscle contractions, either singly or in clusters, that can affect any muscle group . Epilepsy syndromes . Epileptic syndromes may be divided into . Based on the knowledge of etiology, the syndromes are then further subdivided into . idiopathic - presumed to be genetic in origin . symptomatic (secondary) - of known cause . cryptogenic - presumed to be symptomatic but with an unidentified underlying abnormality . The accuracy of classification depends on the extent of investigation . Some of the epilepsy syndromes that may be encountered by the primary care provider are described below . Affected patients usually have normal cognitive function and normal findings on neurological examination . The prognosis for children with benign rolandic epilepsy is excellent . Other useful agents include oxcarbazepine (OXC) and levetiracetam (LEV) . Nearly all patients outgrow the disorder by their teenage years . The patient may spill or drop things during a myoclonic jerk . Less commonly, myoclonic seizures affecting the legs can cause falls . JME is an inherited condition in otherwise neurologically normal children . It usually begins during the teenage years . The AED of choice is VPA . The seizures respond well to treatment but usually recur when medication is withdrawn . Therefore, lifelong therapy is generally recommended . They typically present between 6 months and 5 years old . There may be a family history of epilepsy . The incidence is approximately 4% . Up to 1 in 3 affected children will have recurrent febrile seizures . Infantile spasms are associated with 20% mortality; death usually results from the underlying pathology . Spasms typically begin before 12 months of age, with peak onset at 4-6 months . Seizures may occur dozens, if not hundreds, of times daily . Infantile spasms are often difficult to control . The EEG is characterized by slow (< 2.5 Hz) spike-and-wave patterns superimposed on an abnormal slow background . Brief tonic seizures usually occur during the night, sometimes in clusters . Atonic seizures may vary from head drops to catastrophic falls . Most patients demonstrate abnormalities on neurological examination . Afterwards, the patient is confused for varying periods . Secondary generalization is relatively uncommon . Frontal lobe epilepsy . They have a strong motor component and consciousness is often preserved . Through involvement of the motor areas, there may be clonic movements of the extremities, trunk or face . Patients may jump around, rotate or pound on objects, and commonly exhibit cycling or stepping movements . Epilepsy is part of the phenotype in more than 200 inherited disorders . Although numerous, genetic syndromes probably account for fewer than 1% of all cases of epilepsy . They often result in a developmental abnormality or an irreversible and progressive neuronal cell loss in the brain . Examples include a range of inherited metabolic disorders, mitochondrial encephalopathies and neuronal migration disorders . Many genes have been identified, and the number is set to increase in the coming years . In general, the presumptive causal mutations have been identified in large families with an autosomal-dominant inheritance pattern . Almost all mutations occur in genes that encode voltage-gated or ligand-gated ion channels . It is important to point out that epilepsy syndromes with Mendelian inheritance are rare . It is also hoped that pharmacogenomics will provide a range of novel targets for future AED development . ","A seizure is a symptom of brain dysfunction. Depending on the pattern of onset, seizures are broadly classified into partial (focal) and generalized types; classification is important for identifying the underlying cause, prognosis and best approach to management. Epileptic syndromes are defined by clinical features, aided by appropriate investigations that include EEG and brain imaging. Benign rolandic epilepsy occurs in otherwise neurologically normal children and generally has an excellent response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Long-term AED treatment for children with simple febrile seizures is not recommended. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is often drug resistant but may be successfully treated by temporal lobectomy. Genetic mutations affecting ion channels have been identified in a range of rare idiopathic epilepsy syndromes."
9781910797006,ch08,"General healthcare costs are also increased in patients with COPD, emphasizing the multisystem problems faced by this patient group . There is no general agreement on the definition of an exacerbation of COPD . Most are based on increasing symptoms and/or increased healthcare utilization . The severity of an exacerbation and the consequent healthcare utilization may depend on the severity of the underlying COPD . Respiratory failure may develop in those patients with severe underlying disease or during severe exacerbations . Relatively few of these last studies have involved patients with COPD, and patient numbers have been small . The few studies of biopsies from patients with exacerbations of COPD have predominantly comprised patients with chronic bronchitis with mild airflow limitation; in some of these studies, increased levels of eosinophils were present in induced sputum and in bronchial biopsies from patients with exacerbations . Between 30% and 50% of patients with exacerbations of COPD have a positive sputum culture for bacteria . However, around 20-30% of clinically stable patients also have a positive bacterial culture from sputum . Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are less common during exacerbations of COPD, but occur with increasing frequency in patients with severe airflow limitation . Several studies have shown that viruses (mainly influenza and rhinovirus) are present in around 30% of acute exacerbations of COPD . There are several large population studies showing that the number of exacerbations experienced increases with the severity of the underlying disease . The median number of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD is around 2.2-2.5 exacerbations per year . The frequency of exacerbations can be accurately assessed by patient recall . Follow-up of patients with exacerbations of COPD shows a high readmission rate of around 30% over the first 3 months . Patients with recurrent exacerbations (three or more exacerbations per year) have a higher mortality rate and a decreased quality of life . Pulse oximetry can rapidly provide information about oxygen saturation, but arterial blood gases should be measured in all patients with severe exacerbations . It is particularly important to consider these differential diagnoses in patients with exacerbations of COPD who do not respond to treatment . Influenza vaccination is recommended since it reduces hospitalization for pneumonia in elderly patients with COPD during epidemics . The use of mucolytic agents in COPD has been evaluated in a number of studies . The effects on the frequency of exacerbations have been mixed . There is, however, some evidence that, in patients with COPD who have not been treated with an inhaled corticosteroid, mucolytics may reduce exacerbations . Most exacerbations of COPD are treated in primary care; only a minority of patients are admitted to hospital . The dose and the frequency of use of bronchodilators are increased in home management of exacerbations of COPD . The use of antibiotics in exacerbations of COPD is still controversial . Patients with purulent sputum and at least one of increased breathlessness or increased sputum production show greater improvement with antibiotics than with placebo during exacerbations of COPD . The use of corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD is now well established . Hospital treatment . Blood gases should be measured in all severe exacerbations of COPD . The presence of a pulmonary embolism, which can mimic an exacerbation of COPD, can be very difficult to diagnose, particularly in patients with COPD . Ventilation/perfusion scanning is of no value in patients with COPD . Management of other acute exacerbations of COPD is summarized in Table 8.6 . The role of intravenous aminophylline in the treatment of COPD exacerbations is controversial . Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve lung function effectively in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD . Physiotherapy is not recommended in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure . The objectives of mechanical ventilatory support in patients with exacerbations of COPD are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and relieve symptoms . However, non-invasive ventilation is not appropriate for all patients (Table 8.7) . Use of invasive ventilation in patients with end-stage COPD is influenced by the patient's wishes and the likelihood of reversing the precipitating events . ","Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and place a huge burden on healthcare resources. The main etiologic factors in acute exacerbations are bacterial infection, respiratory viruses and air pollution. Treatment includes oxygen, increased use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and short-term oral glucocorticosteroids. Exacerbations can be prevented by inhaled corticosteroids and vaccination against influenza. Most exacerbations of COPD are managed at home, but those with suspected respiratory failure should be admitted to hospital. Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure."

Of the above, structural imaging has been most extensively used to examine the brains of people with schizophrenia . Early imaging studies . PEG studies documented a number of abnormalities in people with schizophrenia, including ventricular system enlargement . These observations greatly influenced our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . They provided strong evidence that a substantial proportion of people with schizophrenia have structural abnormalities of the brain . The lack of resolution precludes the morphological assessment of specific cortical and subcortical structures . Ventricular enlargement could be due to morphological abnormalities in any one or combination of these structures . Magnetic resonance imaging . The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enabled investigators to overcome the limitations of CT scanning . MRI produces high-quality images, based on the use of magnetic energy and the water content of different tissue types . gray matter, both cortical and subcortical . white matter . As these three compartments can each be measured, MRI enabled investigators to examine whether the brains of people with schizophrenia were characterized by specific morphological abnormalities . MRI can also be used to examine cortical thickness and cortical surface area, an indirect measure of the extent of cortical gyrification . Morphological findings . MRI studies demonstrated for the first time the involvement of cortical and subcortical gray matter structures . Specifically, people with schizophrenia were shown to exhibit decreased volume of the neocortex, by about 5%, with specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices . These brain regions are the neuroanatomic substrate for the complex cognitive behaviors that are disrupted in schizophrenia . In addition to volume reductions in these areas, several studies have found that people with schizophrenia have a reversal or loss of the normal asymmetry of these structures . MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of limbic system structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampus (Figure 6.3) . These structures are involved in the regulation of emotions and various forms of memory . MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of specific thalamic nuclei and total volume of the thalamus . These MRI results are consistent with postmortem study reports documenting decreased volume of the medial dorsal and pulvinar thalamic nuclei . Finally, a series of studies has shown that the brains of people with schizophrenia are characterized by widespread abnormal thinning of the cerebral cortex, with marked changes in the frontal, temporal and cingulated cortical regions . Other MRI findings . In addition to locating the areas of the brain affected by schizophrenia, MRI studies have also been useful for examining . pathophysiological models of schizophrenia . neuroanatomy of cognitive abnormalities and symptoms . etiologic theories of schizophrenia . Progression of brain changes . A series of longitudinal studies involving multiple MRI has evaluated whether schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with fixed morphological abnormalities, or a neurodegenerative disorder, with progressive changes in brain structure . The possible progression of brain changes would be consistent with increased functional disability and cognitive decrements observed in a proportion of people with schizophrenia . Morphological changes associated with specific symptoms . These observations have led to the development of etiologic hypotheses concerning abnormalities in the normal process of brain lateralization . Effect of antipsychotic agents on brain structure . Diffusion tensor imaging . The observation of multiple morphological abnormalities in cortical and subcortical gray matter raises the question of whether there is a disturbance in the white matter fiber tracts that connect these regions . There have been reports of decreased white matter volume, but such changes have not been observed consistently . Moreover, traditional MRI structural scans are not able to differentiate specific fiber tracts . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on the diffusion of water through different brain tissues and allows for the evaluation of white matter integrity . DTI studies have documented widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy (a measure of white matter integrity) in the white matter of people with schizophrenia, but the localization of the abnormalities has differed across studies . In combination with functional imaging, genetic and postmortem studies, DTI studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a dysconnection syndrome, characterized by abnormal connectivity among the different cortical and subcortical brain regions . Summary of brain pathology . ","People with schizophrenia exhibit gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. People with schizophrenia have decreased volume of subcortical structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus and thalamus. A subgroup of patients may exhibit progressive changes in brain structure over the course of their illness. Men with schizophrenia have been found to have greater volume reductions in the temporal lobes than women. Hallucinations, delusions and positive formal thought disorder are associated with decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus. Diffusion tensor imaging studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal connections among cortical and subcortical structures."
9783318068207,hh-5,"As far as variants are concerned and, in particular, when rare or unknown mutations are reported, it is fundamentally important to define the association with the risk of cancer development and progression . define the frequency of appearance in the healthy population . assess the statistical significance of the association with cancer when the same alteration is identified in independent cancer patients . Single nucleotide variants in coding and intronic regions can significantly alter the functions of cancer-related genes . An interesting field of investigation regarding SNVs involves mutations that affect non-coding regions . Mutations in these sequences in 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) are frequently implicated in cancer-related oncogenes . Copy number variants represent an important mechanism of activation and inactivation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively . To overcome these biases, it is possible to define a CNV by the ratio of copies in cancer and normal DNA . Indels present several issues: in particular, they are not always easy to compare using different variant callers (separating real variants from artifacts), because there are several correct ways of reporting them; this factor may significantly limit reproducibility among laboratories . Microsatellites are repetitive, highly preserved DNA sequences that occur throughout the genome . Their nature makes them particularly prone to DNA-mismatching errors (MSI) that can occur during DNA replication . As discussed above, MLH1 mutations are related to loss on IHC of both MLH1 and PMS2; in the same way, mutations in MSH2 relate to the loss of both MSH2 and MSH6 on IHC . Overall, it is necessary to adopt all four IHC antibodies to define MMR status . However, IHC can be affected by several issues - for example, false-negative results may relate to problems with tissue fixation . This latter panel is associated with a higher sensitivity and specificity . In indeterminate IHC cases, PCR may be a reliable and highly specific and sensitive tool to define MSI status . MSI as a predictive biomarker . Because of the development of several mutations, MSI-high (MSI-H) status is a predictive biomarker of response to immunotherapy . Other immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, are now also being used to treat some MSI-H cancers . Tumor mutational burden . TMB is the number of somatic, non-synonymous, coding base mutations that occur in a defined region of a tumor genome . The accumulation of a high number of mutations is able to generate several neoantigens that can potentially elicit a severe immune response against the tumor . In this setting, CGP may usefully detect advanced stage cancers with high TMB . They emphasized that durable clinical benefit and progression-free survival (PFS) were higher in the cohort of patients with more than 200 mutations compared with patients with low TMB (< 200 mutations) . However, as WES is currently unfeasible in routine clinical practice, with its high costs and long turnaround time, several different approaches are now employed, based on wide NGS panels . Patients were defined as having a high TMB when the tumor DNA harbored at least ten mutations per megabase . Different gene panels are available to evaluate TMB status (see Table 3.1) . underlined the positive predictive value for immunotherapy when mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and replication are identified, Skoulidis et al . demonstrated that mutations in STK11 (also known as LKB1) were associated with resistance to immunotherapeutic drugs . Fusions and splice variants . These are chimeric genes generated from the fusion of two different genes belonging to the same or different chromosomes . Another important field of application for RNA-based molecular approaches is the identification of splice variants . However, several issues affect RNA analysis . In particular, fixation procedures may significantly influence RNA integrity and stability . An important limitation is that the RT-PCR method can only identify known alterations . This limitation can be overcome by NGS, which allows the identification of known and unknown gene alterations for different patients simultaneously . However, NGS suffers from several limitations related to high costs and, in particular, data interpretation (see Chapter 6) . In addition, the nCounter technology is able to identify several gene fusions and splice variants, even when RNA is of low quality and target capture amplification fails . The nCounter system has a number of limitations, however . ","Comprehensive genomic profiles offer a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor. The interpretation of the different variants reported, with attention focused on their clinical significance and usefulness for cancer patients, can support oncologists to make informed cancer treatment decisions. The clinical and pathological significance of several molecular variants, including SNVs, CNVs and indels, remains unknown. Some therapies are indicated for MSI-H cancer, and others are in clinical trials. Careful attention should be paid to the accuracy of the MMR evaluation (IHC, PCR or NGS). WES or wide gene panels may be employed to assess TMB status to guide immunotherapy decisions. RNA-based molecular approaches play a pivotal role in the identification of targetable gene fusions and splice variants."
9781910797105,ch04,"Like most disorders, schizophrenia results from an interaction of genes and environment, with likely gene-gene interactions (known as epistasis) . Classic studies . The most straightforward studies in population genetics are family studies . Usually, a series of individuals with schizophrenia, known as probands or index cases, is selected and rates of schizophrenia are assessed in their biological families . These rates are compared with rates in the families of control probands, usually healthy volunteers . The risk of schizophrenia in relatives depends first on how close the relative is to the proband (Figure 4.1) . Relatives of female probands have higher rates of schizophrenia than relatives of male probands . Family studies can never give conclusive proof of genetic effects, as familiality could be due to a shared environmental factor . Nevertheless, family studies have shown that if there is a genetic effect, it does not follow a recognized Mendelian pattern of autosomal dominance, like Huntington's disease, or recessiveness, like cystic fibrosis . Studies in twins and adopted children . MZ twins share 100% of their genes and DZ twins share about 50% . Adoption studies offer the most robust evidence for genetic effects, as family environment is taken out of the equation . Both follow-up and follow-back studies (see below) have shown that it is biological parentage rather than adoptive parentage that predisposes to schizophrenia . Follow-up studies trace the biological children of mothers with schizophrenia, who were adopted into healthy families at birth, and compare the number of offspring who develop schizophrenia with control adoptees of healthy non-schizophrenic mothers . Follow-back studies start with a group of adults with schizophrenia who were known to be adopted at birth . A number of other schizophrenia spectrum disorders are found in the families of probands with schizophrenia (Table 4.1) . These cognitive abnormalities may be more sensitive than diagnostic categories for indicating the presence of genes for schizophrenia . They can supplement the use of diagnostic categories in genetic studies, enhancing the likelihood of detecting these genes . How to look for genes . Clinically, schizophrenia varies widely in its symptoms and course . Interaction between genes (epistasis) also occurs . People differ genetically in three main ways . There are over 2 million known SNPs and while most are silent, a few have subtle effects . The search for genes in schizophrenia is difficult for several reasons (Table 4.2) . Until recently, the search for risk genes was directed by genetic linkage studies that revealed the location of particular risk loci on the chromosome, candidate gene studies, or the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities that increased risk . Nowadays, the whole genome can be studied simultaneously in genome-wide association studies in which over 500000 SNPs spread across the genome are tested for association with schizophrenia . Risk genes for schizophrenia . It is emerging that there are multiple susceptibility genes for schizophrenia . To date, the definitive genome-wide association studies in 37 000 adults with schizophrenia and 113 000 controls have shown 108 different genetic associations, including dopamine and glutamate receptor genes and calcium channel genes . Most of the genes found by genome-wide association studies to be implicated in schizophrenia do seem plausible in that they are known to exert effects on neuronal systems and particularly synaptic function . Examples are being uncovered of synergistic gene-gene interactions, and of how specific genes interact with specific environmental risk factors (Table 4.4) . Studies looking at patterns of gene expression in the postmortem brain suggest changes in particular functional gene groups in schizophrenia, such as those related to oligodendrocyte and myelin development and synaptic transmission . Rates of CNVs have been shown to be higher in schizophrenia as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (Table 4.5) . As genes predisposing to schizophrenia are now being discovered, there is renewed interest in the association between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . It has long been known that neither disorder 'breeds true' . The children of mothers with schizophrenia have a sixfold increased risk of bipolar disorder, as well as higher rates of schizophrenia . Estimates suggest that perhaps 60% of the genetic variance for the two disorders is shared . Some genes, such as DISC1 and NRG1, appear to predispose to both disorders and perhaps have their strongest effect in schizoaffective disorders . Raised rates of CNVs are seen in schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder . ","Having a close relative with schizophrenia increases one's own risk 15-fold. Identical twins show a 45% concordance rate. Individual vulnerability genes exist, which are each of small effect and interact with other genes and with environmental factors. A growing number of susceptibility genes have been identified, some of which also predispose to bipolar disorder. Copy number variants are rare major genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders."
9781910797006,ch03,"Symptoms and signs therefore vary in any individual depending on the stage of the disease . In COPD, because the expiratory airflow is reduced, the lungs empty slowly . This hyperinflation compromises the use of the inspiratory reserve volume and breathlessness worsens . Episodes of marked worsening, termed exacerbations, may be precipitated by acute infections . Exacerbations are distinct events and exceed the minimal day to day variation in symptoms . The appearance of breathlessness heralds moderate-to-severe airflow limitation . Generally, this takes the form of greatly restricted activity . The perception of breathlessness varies greatly between individuals with the same degree of ventilatory capacity . Position has a variable effect on breathlessness . Cough and sputum production . Up to 50% of cigarette smokers have a productive cough . Cough may also be exacerbated by gastroesophageal reflux . Excessive sputum production (more than 60 mL/day) should raise the possibility of bronchiectasis . Other symptoms . Pleuritic chest pain may suggest an intercurrent pneumothorax, pneumonia or pulmonary infarction . A detailed history is important in COPD and should include . full smoking history . exposure to other risk factors, particularly gases or dusts, and an occupational history . medical history including asthma, allergy, sinusitis, nasal polyps, respiratory infection in childhood and other respiratory diseases . symptom development . exacerbations or previous hospitalizations for respiratory disorders . presence of comorbidity . appropriateness of current medical treatment . social and family support available to the patient . Occupational exposure to dusts has an additive effect on the decline in lung function . This has particularly been shown in coal miners in whom both smoking and years of dust exposure contribute to the decline in FEV . Similar additive effects have been observed with air pollution . The contribution of smoking, however, is three times as great as that of dust exposure in miners . Physical signs . Physical signs of airflow limitation are rarely present until lung function is significantly impaired . Breathing pattern . Signs of overinflation include . horizontal ribs with prominent sternal angle and wide subcostal angle . reduced distance between the suprasternal notch and the cricoid cartilage (normally three finger-breadths) . inspiratory tracheal tug . Physical appearance . Weight loss may be apparent in advanced disease, as well as a reduction in muscle mass . Cardiovascular signs . Overinflation of the chest makes it difficult to locate the apex beat and reduces the cardiac dullness . The heave of right ventricular hypertrophy may be palpable at the lower left sternal edge or in the subcostal angle . Splitting of the second heart sound with an increased pulmonary component may be present . Peripheral vasodilation accompanies hypercapnia, producing warm peripheries with a high-volume pulse . Pitting peripheral edema may be present as a result of fluid retention . Hepatic signs . The liver may be tender and pulsatile, and a prominent 'v' wave may be visible in the jugular venous pulse . Skin signs . Wrinkling of the skin has been associated with the presence of emphysema . Clinical presentation . All smokers should quit . However, close questioning often reveals the presence of progressive symptoms . Systemic effects and comorbidities . Skeletal muscle dysfunction . This suggests that skeletal muscle dysfunction is an important factor in the symptom complex . Indeed, the FEV is an established predictor of cardiovascular mortality . This may be due, in part, to concurrent smoking and to the use of corticosteroids . Lung cancer . Other respiratory conditions . Systemic inflammation . Spectrum of disease . The CAT is the preferred test as it provides a comprehensive assessment of symptoms (www . A CAT score of 10 or more indicates a high level of symptoms . The highest risk parameter should be recorded for the purposes of this assessment . Alternatively, the COPD Foundation Guide recommends assessing seven independent domains of severity (Table 3.4) . ","COPD occurs, though less commonly, in those who do not smoke. Usually (in 80% of patients) there is a significant smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. For those with lesser smoking histories or for younger individuals, consider an alternative diagnosis or a genetic predisposition (exempli gratia alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency). The most common symptom in COPD is breathlessness on exertion. Dyspnea may be discounted by patients until disease is severe, as breathlessness can be avoided by restricting activity. Physical signs often present only at an advanced stage of the disease. Clinical indicators include signs of overinflation, prominent use of accessory muscles of respiration, weight loss, expiratory wheeze, cyanosis, peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure. These are usually apparent only in severe disease. The systemic effects of COPD result in a number of comorbidities that impact on the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The full spectrum of COPD can now be better identified using new classifications of disease that take into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation."
9781908541406,ch_13,"The normal hemostatic mechanism and routine assessment tests are discussed in Chapter 2; however, a normal coagulation screen does not exclude a bleeding disorder . excessive bleeding with previous surgery or dental extractions; for example, a need to return to the dentist because of recurrent bleeding from the socket . menorrhagia, defined as excessive bleeding beyond the usual first 48 hours of menses, bleeding persisting for more than 5-7 days or a history of blood-loss anemia . a family history of bleeding . The physical findings that suggest a possible bleeding disorder are . If the history and physical examination do not suggest a bleeding disorder, laboratory studies are unlikely to be helpful . Often, extensive laboratory testing yields borderline abnormalities that do not predict bleeding and merely waste time . On the other hand, laboratory tests may be normal in patients with a clear history of previous bleeding; usually these patients have excessive surgical blood loss despite the normal tests . If these tests are normal, bleeding due to a platelet disorder is unlikely, but more sophisticated tests may be needed to exclude some congenital platelet function defects and milder forms of von Willebrand disease (see Chapter 7) . If the patient has a strong history suggestive of a bleeding disorder but normal screening tests, specific clotting factor levels should be measured or more detailed tests of platelet function performed . A prolonged aPTT with a normal PT is usually observed in patients receiving heparin, or when heparin contaminates a line being used for blood sampling . The presence of heparin may be readily suspected if the patient has a prolonged PT but a normal Reptilase time . A mixing test (mixing equal volumes of the patient's plasma with normal plasma and determining the aPTT again) will exclude circulating anticoagulant . Deficiencies of factor (F)VIII, FIX and FXI are associated with bleeding (see Chapters 6 and) . Deficiencies of FXII, prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight kininogen are not associated with bleeding, even though the aPTT is prolonged . If a specific abnormality is not identified by the platelet count, bleeding time, PFA-100 analysis, aPTT or PT, patients with a history of bleeding should be referred to a coagulation consultant for further evaluation . Intraoperative bleeding . Most surgical bleeding is due to local factors such as highly vascular tissues, anastomotic leaks, slipped ligatures or other technical problems, and poor wound healing . For example, oozing at the surgical site suggests impaired platelet function . Another important cause of intraoperative bleeding is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; see Chapter 12) . Bleeding in the postoperative period may be due to local factors or to a coagulopathy . When the coagulation screen and full blood count are normal the most common causes of bleeding are local surgical factors (exempli gratia a small bleeding vessel) . Thrombocytopenia may occur because of dilution, platelet consumption or impaired platelet production . Giving the appropriate replacement therapy will control bleeding . Rarely, a patient will develop a circulating anticoagulant in the postoperative period (see Chapter 13) . FVIII autoantibodies and antibodies to bovine proteins that cross-react with human FV are both associated with bleeding . If this is a cause of bleeding, recombinant human FVIIa may secure hemostasis . Bleeding associated with cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . Thus, bleeding in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is usually multifactorial . Up to 7% of patients have bleeding that is sufficiently severe to require re-exploration . The principal causes of bleeding in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery are . local surgical or anatomic factors . Bleeding due to excessive fibrinolysis generally occurs in patients undergoing more complicated procedures or repeat operations with prolonged pump times . Bleeding associated with periprocedural anticoagulation . A recent study observed that bleeding occurred significantly more often in patients receiving bridging anticoagulation (3% versus 1%; p = 0.017), and was more likely if heparin was reinitiated within 24 hours of surgery . Massive uncontrollable bleeding . Occasionally, patients undergoing surgery for repair of major trauma will have massive bleeding, defined as the loss of 150% or more of blood volume . ","A carefully taken history is the best screening test for a coagulation disorder. If a bleeding tendency is suspected, the platelet function analyzer-100 test, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the prothrombin time (PT) may identify the cause. Thromboelastography may be useful in patients with massive bleeding. The management of surgical bleeding includes meticulous local hemostatic measures, as well as replacement of red cells, fibrinogen and platelets. Consider vitamin K therapy in every postoperative patient with a prolonged prothrombin time."
9781908541277,ch_12,"Nearly 1 in 3 patients reports significant concern about their mood . Not surprisingly then, mood states and psychiatric comorbidities substantially contribute to the quality of life of patients with epilepsy . The three most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are depression, anxiety and psychosis . Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up to 55% of patients in some studies - and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than seizure-specific variables such as seizure frequency and severity . Depression is under-recognized and, when diagnosed, often undertreated . Depression associated with epilepsy differs clinically from depressive disorders in non-epileptic patients . Accordingly, symptoms of depression in patients with epilepsy often fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for affective disorders set out in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) . Diagnosis may be further complicated if the patient minimizes their psychiatric symptoms, or if the clinician does not inquire about psychiatric symptoms or considers depression to be part of the normal adaptation to the diagnosis of epilepsy . Clinicians often inadequately treat depression because they are concerned that antidepressant therapy will increase seizure frequency . The overall suicide rate in depressed patients with epilepsy is five times higher than that in the general population and as much as 25 times higher in patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin . Patients experience depression most often interictally as a chronic, waxing and waning disorder, usually in association with variable levels of irritability and emotionality . Some patients experience depression during a simple partial seizure (ictal depression) or during the postictal state . Few controlled trials of antidepressants have been conducted in patients with epilepsy and depression . Electroconvulsive therapy is not absolutely contraindicated in patients with epilepsy but should be reserved for medication-resistant depression . Anxiety is the second most common psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some studies . Anxiety markedly compromises quality of life and psychosocial functioning, even more so than depression in one study . Patients experience anxiety most commonly interictally in the form of a generalized anxiety disorder . SSRIs and benzodiazepines are most often used, though no controlled studies in patients with epilepsy have been reported . The incidence of psychosis varies according to the epilepsy syndrome, from 3.3% in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy to 14% in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy . Additionally, it correlates with epilepsy severity: psychosis occurs in 0.6-7% of patients with epilepsy in the community and 19-27% of patients with epilepsy who require hospitalization . Postictal psychosis generally begins years after the onset of epilepsy . Patients with bilateral seizure foci, bilateral limbic lesions and clusters of complex partial seizures are at particularly high risk . Compared with patients with schizophrenia, patients with interictal psychosis have an absence of negative symptoms, better premorbid state, less deterioration of personality and better response to pharmacotherapy . There are no controlled trials of antipsychotic or atypical antipsychotic medications in patients with epilepsy and psychosis . Some AEDs, such as TPM, VGB and LEV, can occasionally produce psychotic reactions in susceptible patients . There are very few, if any, aspects of daily living that remain unaffected by the diagnosis of epilepsy . Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle . There are very few, if any, aspects of daily living that remain unaffected by the diagnosis of epilepsy . Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle . Numerous surveys show that rates of unemployment and underemployment are much higher in patients with epilepsy than in the general population . Patients whose education was interrupted by epilepsy-related complications may need additional vocational training before they seek employment . Whether patients should disclose their epilepsy before being hired is best dealt with on a case-by-case basis . Clinicians should also remember that side effects of AEDs, especially sedation, may interfere with a patient's ability to safely operate a vehicle, and should advise patients accordingly . Life insurance . Patients with epilepsy may be unable to find affordable life insurance, particularly if applying for an individual policy . Patients who obtain life insurance through their place of employment generally do not have a problem . ","Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life. The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures. Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures. When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients. Patients with epilepsy may have difficulty in finding affordable life insurance. Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures without unduly limiting activities."
9781910797815,chp3,"Accurate diagnosis and regular monitoring during treatment are key to the effective management of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) . The 2016 updated WHO criteria differ from the 2008 criteria in the following ways . Prefibrotic and overt PMF are differentiated as distinct entities . As noted in Chapter 2, some cases of familial MPN have been reported, and it may therefore be useful to interview patients to identify any family history, and to perform complete blood counts in apparently healthy relatives in families with such a history . Diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia . Diagnosis of polycythemia vera . In contrast to ET, PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and PMF . The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PV are shown in Table 3.3 and an algorithm for the differential diagnosis in Figure 3.2 . Diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis . As noted above, the presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include . symptomatic splenomegaly . constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus . thrombosis or bleeding . extramedullary hematopoiesis . bone pain . Disease burden . For example, an internet-based survey found that almost all of 1179 patients with myeloproliferative disorders reported some constitutional symptoms (Figure 3.4) . The most common was fatigue, reported by 81% of patients, followed by pruritus (52%) and night sweats (49%) . Furthermore, many patients reported decreased functioning, and 14% reported being disabled . Constitutional symptoms in patients with MPNs have a number of causes, including . cytopenias, which lead to fatigue and decreased physical activity (which may further worsen fatigue) . dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, leading to an overall catabolic state characterized by night sweats, fevers and weight loss . splenomegaly, leading to abdominal discomfort and early satiety . Assessment of symptoms is therefore an essential aspect of treatment monitoring . Risk stratification . Since the level of risk influences treatment decisions, risk stratification is essential in the management of MPNs . ET is usually considered to have the best prognosis among the MPNs . To date, two prognostic scoring systems have been developed for use in patients with ET . the European LeukemiaNet system, which stratifies patients according to age, previous thrombosis and platelet count . The characteristics of these scoring systems are summarized in Table 3.6 . The IPSET model has also been used to estimate the likelihood of survival in patients with ET although this has not been validated prospectively . A recent modification of IPSET-thrombosis proposes the addition of a very-low-risk group . Prognostic models for PV are summarized in Table 3.7 . However, stratification by genetic risk is not currently widely used in clinical practice . For both ET and PV, mutation status and other molecular markers are likely to become increasingly important in risk stratification . Three principal scoring systems are currently used for PMF (Table 3.8), all based on age, blood counts and the presence of constitutional symptoms . the International Prognostic Scoring system (IPSS) is used to estimate survival at the time of diagnosis . the Dynamic IPSS (DIPSS) can be applied at any time during the course of the disease . the DIPPS-plus is a modified version of the DIPSS that incorporates three additional risk factors: unfavorable karyotype, low platelet count and need for transfusion . Further versions of the IPSS have also been developed to incorporate genetic risk (the Mutation-Enhanced IPSS [MIPSS70]) and cytogenetic risk (MIPSS70-Plus) . This model allocates points according to various molecular risk factors, and stratifies risk into four categories (Table 3.9) . Clinical presentation . The MPNs vary markedly in morphologic and clinical features (Table 3.1) . Thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis are major diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV), respectively . ","The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are based on abnormalities of peripheral blood counts and alterations in bone marrow morphology. The diagnostic approach to essential thrombocythemia (ET) generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. In contrast to ET, polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include symptomatic splenomegaly, anemia, constitutional symptoms (exempli gratia fatigue, pruritus), thrombosis and bleeding. In addition to the risk of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life. An individual patient's risk of vascular complications and disease progression depends on multiple clinical and molecular risk factors. Since the level of risk will influence treatment decisions, effective risk stratification is essential for effective management of MPNs. Risk stratification models have been developed for all three MPNs."
9781910797310,chp3,"Ilaria Onorati MD and Olaf Mercier MD PhD, Department of Thoracic and Vascular Surgery and Heart-Lung Transplantation, Marie Lannelongue Hospital, Thoracic Oncology Institute, Paris-Saclay University, Le Plessis Robinson, France . Surgical resection of locally advanced NSCLC . Most lung cancers are detected at an advanced stage and are treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Surgical resection has proved valuable in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC without nodal involvement or distant metastasis, resulting in long-term survival with a lower risk of postoperative mortality . Advances in perioperative management and postoperative care along with careful patient selection, are likely to make the operative mortality and morbidity less prohibitive . The prognosis after operations for T4 tumors mainly depends on the N stage and completeness of the resection . The European and US guidelines for treatment of N2 disease are shown in Table 3.5 . TNM classification (IASLC, eighth edition) . As stage is one of the most important prognostic factors at diagnosis and is essential when making treatment decisions, it is important that it is as accurate as possible . The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has proposed several changes to be implemented in the forthcoming eighth edition, which reflect global experience in the management of NSCLC . Tumor size (T) is the primary descriptive and most significant prognostic factor for operable lung cancer . Table 3.1 shows the proposed changes to the current T classification . Surgical advances have enabled 'distance from the carina' to be removed from the new TNM classification . However, the poor prognosis associated with pleural invasion has been confirmed, and therefore it remains a contraindication to surgery . Nodal status (N) . The current N classification of nodal staging adequately predicts prognosis, so no change to the N descriptors has been recommended in the eighth edition . Although N2a1 was associated with a better prognosis than N1b, the difference was not significant . There will also be a new M1c classification (Table 3.3) - multiple metastases in a single organ or in multiple organs . Surgical resection of early-stage NSCLC . Minimally invasive surgery versus open surgery . Minimally invasive procedures for early-stage NSCLC have become standard and an alternative to open surgery in centers with the appropriate experience . Furthermore, patients who underwent VATS had significantly higher adherence to adjuvant chemotherapy (earlier onset and higher completion rate) than those who underwent thoracotomy . However, there was no difference in oncologic results or lung function recovery during the late postoperative period . Further studies may help to determine the role of robotic surgery in NSCLC in the future . Wedge resection versus segmentectomy versus lobectomy . A review of 45 prospective and retrospective studies conducted over the last 25 years showed that segmentectomies are superior to wedge resections in terms of local recurrences and cancer-related mortality rates . Whether the long-term results of lung-sparing segmentectomies and lobectomies are equivalent has yet to be determined . Segmentectomies may also be considered in high-risk patients, or in the case of pure bronchoalveolar carcinomas for lung-sparing purposes . Ground glass opacity (GGO) is a pulmonary shadow visualized using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), comprised of hazy increased attenuation with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins . Adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of GGO, therefore careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy must be considered when GGO is identified . Patients with multiple tumors and a prominent ground glass component on imaging or lepidic component on microscopy are being seen with increasing frequency . Sublobar resection with the goal of sparing lung parenchyma is the gold standard for treatment of small GGO . Different means of tracking the GGO and guiding the resection have been studied, including ink injection, coil insertion, and indocianide green injection . Diffuse pneumonic-type involvement has a worse prognosis; it can lead to severe hypoxemia and end-stage respiratory distress . In this setting, a lobectomy is preferable to sublobar resection . A single N and M category is used for all pulmonary areas of involvement . ","Better subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare wedge resection and segmentectomy. New M1c staging for multiple metastases in one or several organs and the use of the term M1b for oligometastatic disease has the potential to provide rational selection criteria for clinical treatment trials. Ground glass opacity (GGO) visualized on high-resolution computed tomography should trigger careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy. Some locally advanced lung cancers benefit from multimodality therapy, which can include surgery."
9781910797426,ch12,"Ampullary, bile duct and duodenal tumors . Cancers of the ampulla of Vater, the intrapancreatic bile duct and duodenum are all adenocarcinomas and often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer . Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors . Two pathological types of ampullary cancer have been described (intestinal versus pancreaticobiliary), with important consequences for patients' prognosis . Duodenal tumors also commence as adenomas before progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma . Ampullary tumors are relatively common (around 1 per 100 000 in the general population), whereas bile duct cancer is much less common and duodenal cancer is rare . The incidence of duodenal tumors is increased in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and also Peutz-Jeghers syndrome . These tumors often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer, with obstructive jaundice and weight loss . Patients with duodenal cancer present with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to occult upper gastrointestinal blood loss . Clinical presentation . All three tumor types may mimic pancreatic cancer and vice versa . Pancreatic cancer may invade into or ulcerate the ampulla, giving the appearance of an ampullary cancer . Ampullary cancer will invade the duodenum and pancreatic parenchyma, mimicking pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic cancer may invade and ulcerate the duodenum, giving the appearance of a duodenal cancer . Invasion of the pancreas is typical of a duodenal cancer . Bile duct cancer may invade the main pancreatic duct, giving rise to the classic double-duct sign of pancreatic cancer; the converse applies to 95% of pancreatic cancers arising in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas . The 5-year survival rates for completely resected tumors are about 50%, 30% and 25% for cancers of the ampulla, bile duct and duodenum, respectively . Unlike pancreatic cancer, long-term cure is possible in a large proportion of patients with these cancers (see Figure 12.1) . Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors . In contrast to most other tumors of the pancreas, these tumors tend to be highly vascular, a feature that is important in making a radiological diagnosis . Nevertheless, this is a heterogeneous group of tumors and the incidence varies according to each specific pNET . MEN type-1 is seen in less than 5% of patients with pNETs . Carcinoid tumors only cause symptoms if there are large-volume hepatic metastases . Localization of tumors . These features are important in localizing tumors, which can often be very small . EUS is also helpful for patients with MEN type-1 or VHL syndrome . It is used to identify pancreatic and extrapancreatic tumors in order to permit timely medical and surgical intervention . The risk of malignancy increases with tumor size (more than 2-3 cm) . Medical treatment . Gastrinomas are often multiple and are commonly found in the duodenal wall . Inherited pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors . Multiple facial angiofibromas occur in 85% of patients . The spectrum of pancreatic islet tumors comprises . non-functioning tumors, including pancreatic polypeptide tumors (PPomas), in 10-50% . Multiple pancreatic cysts are common and are invariably benign . The mean age at detection of pancreatic lesions is 38 years . Other tumor types . Cystic pancreatic tumors . These tumors are harmless and may be observed serially using CT or EUS . Other malignant cystic lesions . Pancreatic lymphoma . By definition pancreatic lymphoma is restricted to the pancreas and draining lymph nodes . Metastases to the pancreas . Molecular profiling to enable accurate distinction between tumor types . Specific medical treatments for the different tumor types . Improved surveillance in patients with inherited pNETs . ","Tumor types that occur in the ampullary and periampullary regions may have a much better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Neuroendocrine tumors should usually be removed surgically. Patients with inherited neuroendocrine tumors require genetic counseling and long-term follow-up for pancreatic and other tumor types. Cystic pancreatic tumors need to be differentiated from pancreatic pseudocysts, but only a minority need resection at the time of diagnosis. Solitary metastases to the pancreas may be worth resecting."
9781908541024,ch_9,"Germ cell tumors, the most common type of tumor in the pineal region, comprise a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors arising from pluripotential germinal cells . The most common is the germinoma, accounting for 40-60% of all germ cell tumors . Other germ cell tumors include teratomas, and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors such as choriocarcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor and embryonal carcinoma . The different germ cell tumor markers are shown in Table 8.2 . In the western hemisphere, these tumors account for 0.4-3.4% of intracranial neoplasms . For unknown reasons, the incidence in Japan is significantly higher at 2.1-9.4%, and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors constitute an increased proportion of all germ cell tumors . More than 70% of germ cell tumors present before the patient reaches the age of 21 years, typically in those aged 10-13 years . Most arise in the pineal region, but one-third occur in the suprasellar region . Males are 2-4 times more likely than females to develop a germ cell tumor, but there is a predilection for suprasellar tumors to occur in females . An increased incidence of germ cell tumors has been reported in both Klinefelter and Down syndromes . Non-germinomatous germ cell tumors are highly malignant and commonly exhibit mixed histological features . Immature teratomas are much more common than mature teratomas, and may have elements of carcinoma, sarcoma or other non-germinomatous germ cell tumors . Patients with pineal region tumors present with features of obstructive hydrocephalus, resulting from occlusion of the aqueduct of Sylvius . In addition to tumors in the pineal region, a subset of germ cell tumors arise in a suprasellar location . Decreased visual acuity occurs in up to 84% of patients . There are various means of evaluating a suspected germ cell tumor, as shown in Table 8.3 . This is particularly important when a non-germinomatous germ cell tumor is suspected, as these tumors often have mixed histology . Prognosis and treatment are determined by the most malignant histology within a tumor . Although serum and CSF markers can be helpful when positive, negative markers do not exclude an aggressive histology, as non-germinomatous germ cell tumors can be marker-negative . CSF studies and spinal MRI should also be obtained in all patients with a germ cell tumor . Treatment differs for pure germinomas, teratomas and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors, as described below . However, other germ cell tumors benefit from radical resection and mature teratomas can be cured with complete resection . Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with pure germinoma . All germ cell tumors are chemosensitive and successful regimens, usually platinum-based, have been reported for relapse, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment . Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with suprasellar germ cell tumors be evaluated and followed by an endocrinologist . Germ cell tumors tend to recur locally . Leptomeningeal recurrence is usually accompanied by recurrence at the primary tumor site . Pineal parenchymal tumors . Patients should be treated with chemotherapy and craniospinal radiotherapy, with a focal boost to the tumor site . Treatment of pineal region tumors is summarized in Table 8.4 . Pineal region cysts . Epidermoid and dermoid cysts may also occur in the pineal region . Pineal region tumors . It is useful to consider pineal region tumors as a group for the purposes of differential diagnosis . The tumors in this region include germ cell tumors, pineal parenchymal tumors, pineal region cysts, gliomas, meningiomas and Vein of Galen aneurysms (Table 8.1) . The wide range of tumor types that can arise in the pineal region makes histological diagnosis mandatory . The only exception is a patient with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that indicate the presence of a malignant germ cell tumor . ",Tumors of the pineal region often present with obstructive hydrocephalus. The wide range of tumor types that can arise in the pineal region makes histological diagnosis mandatory.

9781910797617,chp6,"Molecular testing is destined to become an essential part of the initial characterization of patients with AML . As described in Chapter 3, four new treatments for AML were recently approved, three of which are molecularly targeted products, marking a turning point in the treatment of AML . FLT3 inhibitors . The addition of crenolanib to standard 3 + 7 induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML resulted in 88% complete response rate (CR), with no unexpected toxicities . Quizartinib is being investigated across multiple lines of treatment, including induction and consolidation chemotherapy, as a maintenance therapy for patients in first remission after chemotherapy, and for salvage therapy . Gilteritinib is also being evaluated across multiple lines of treatment in patients with FLT3-positive AML, including for maintenance treatment following chemotherapy or HCT, first-line treatment, and in comparison with salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease . Sorafenib has also been explored as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed FLT3 -mutated AML, before or after transplant, with profound and sustained remissions being observed in some patients . Decitabine and subcutaneous azacitidine are already used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and AML . Histone deacetylase inhibitors . Pracinostat is an oral histone deacetylase inhibitor that is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in older patients (>= 75 years) who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy (because of age or comorbidities) . Venetoclax is also being evaluated in combination with low-dose cytarabine in a non-randomized open-label Phase I/II study in elderly patients (>= 65 years) with treatment-naÃ¯ve AML who not eligible for intensive chemotherapy . E-selectin inhibitors . GMI-1271 is a novel antagonist of E-selectin, an adhesion molecule expressed in AML cells that has been shown to enhance responses to chemotherapy . Novel immunotherapies . In both cases, autologous B-cells are collected from the patient by apheresis, genetically engineered to target CD19, then infused back into the patient . High response rates and durable remissions have been reported in patients with highly refractory disease . Clearly, there are unique features of the target in B-lymphocytes (CD19; in particular, its lack of expression in other tissues beyond B-cells) . A number of other CAR immune cells targeting other molecules are in development, including in AML . CD123 is highly expressed in BPDCN and in early myeloid cells . Treatment of two patients with the CD123-CAR T-cell product (UCART123) resulted in cytokine release syndrome and one death . Nevertheless, studies of cellular therapies, including CAR-T and natural killer (NK) cells, and antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 and other markers, are of interest . Studies with cellular therapies and other antibody-based therapies are of great interest and promise in AML, including with CAR-T or NK cells, and likewise with antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 or other markers of interest . A new era for clinical trials in AML? . Trials of new targeted agents are also likely to be in small, clearly identified patient populations . The aim is to quickly and comprehensively genetically characterize older patients (> 60 years) with previously untreated AML and to treat with novel targeted therapy on the basis of the genetic result . Within a week of diagnosis, patients will be assigned to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations (Table 6.2) . Each group is treated with unique therapy designed for that molecular aberration . Patients with poor long-term outcomes and lower remission rates with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with a p53 mutation) receive less intensive therapy . Hopefully, such an approach will quickly identify promising agents and speed up drug approvals in AML . Subsequent iterations of the trial (exempli gratia 'version 2.0' and beyond) will include agents for other targets and possibly combinations of novel drugs . Of critical importance to the Beat AML trial, as well as for trials of treatments, is the need to achieve disease control in order to facilitate the opportunity for alloHCT for eligible patients . Even in the era of molecular targeted treatment, alloHCT remains the best tool available for the prevention of relapse . ","A wide range of targeted agencies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently in the late stages of development, including FLT3 inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, giltertinib, sorafenib), hypomethylating agents (guadecitabine, oral azacitidine), the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat, the blc-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the E-selectin inhibitor GM-1271. Immunologic therapies, antibody-drug conjugates and antibody-based approaches are also being explored in AML. The approval of enasidenib based on single-arm Phase I/II data is challenging the dogma that large randomized controlled trials in a general AML population are required. Trials of new targeted agents are likely to be in small, clearly defined patients with subtypes of AML. The Beat AML trial is using early and comprehensive genetic characterization to assign patients to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations, each receiving a tailored treatment. This approach will hopefully speed up the development of promising agents. Key to all approaches to the treatment of AML is the need to achieve disease control, and continued consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation when feasible."
9781908541994,ch02,"The pathophysiology of acne centers on the interplay of four main factors (Figure 2.1) . increased sebum production . follicular hyperkeratinization . the action of Propionibacterium acnes within the follicle and dermis . Increased sebum production . Acne is a hormonally mediated disease, with androgens contributing to an increase in sebum production from sebaceous glands . Increased sebum production, which presents as seborrhea, correlates well with acne severity . Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is thought to be the main androgen responsible for sebum production, although a possible direct role of testosterone has not been excluded . Follicular hyperkeratinization involves increased keratinocyte proliferation and decreased desquamation of the cells lining the orifice of sebaceous follicles of the face, scalp, chest or back, resulting in sebum- and keratin-filled microcomedones . A microcomedone is not clinically visible but can be identified by surface follicular biopsy using cyanoacrylate glue applied to a glass microscope slide . As hyperkeratinization progresses, a microcomedone develops into either an open comedone (blackhead) or a closed comedone (whitehead) . It takes approximately 8 weeks for a microcomedone to develop into a visible acne lesion . This is one reason why the full effect of acne medications is not achieved until therapy has been administered for several weeks . This process of follicular hyperkeratinization and possibly an increase in cell division and cohesiveness of the cells lining the follicular lumen, producing comedones, has been referred to as 'follicular plugging', although complete occlusion of the follicular lumen does not occur; sebum still flows from follicles affected with acne . The cause of follicular hyperkeratinization is not known but may relate to a local deficiency of linoleic acid or production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 within the follicle . Colonization with Propionibacterium acnes . Once sebum production begins at adrenarche, sebaceous follicles become colonized with the commensal bacterium P . This bacterium utilizes sebaceous lipids as a nutrient source and hydrolyzes the triglycerides found in sebum into free fatty acids and glycerol . The free fatty acids are an irritant to the follicular wall and can lead to rupture of the follicle, with subsequent release of keratin-rich corneocytes and sebum into the dermis . This process intensifies the inflammation associated with acne (see below) . Recent evidence suggests that P . acnes may form a biofilm within follicles that may make them less susceptible to treatment with antibiotics and oxidizing agents . Inflammatory lesions are thought to develop from comedones following the influx of inflammatory cells and/or rupture of the follicular wall . Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of inflammatory responses even in the very earliest phases of acne lesion development . Inflammatory mediators stimulate vasodilatation and neutrophil chemotaxis into the pores, which may result in papules and pustules . Papules and pustules may evolve into tender inflammatory nodules or 'cysts' as the extent of the inflammation increases . Inflammatory acne may produce scarring . Atrophic scars (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) are caused by a loss of tissue, while hypertrophic or fibrotic scars (Figure 2.4) are due to an increase in tissue . Modifying factors . Myths still remain about factors that might influence the disease and the appropriate facts should be shared with the patient . For example, acne is frequently worse before the menstrual period . The role of diet in acne is controversial . Factors that have been implicated include 'glycemic load', the intake of dairy products, skim milk, chocolate and whey, obesity, reduced intake of fish, lack of omega-3 fatty acids and others . Epidemiological studies suggest a possible link with intake of skim milk, while clinical trials in very small numbers of patients suggest that a diet with a low glycemic index may be beneficial in patients with acne, as summarized in recent systematic reviews on this topic . Questions that patients frequently ask are summarized in Table 8.1, pages 83-4 . ","Acne is a hormonally mediated disease. Four main factors are implicated in the etiology of acne:- high sebum production- hyperkeratinization of the intrafollicular duct- colonization by Propionibacterium acnes- inflammation. There are many myths about the factors that influence acne; patients should be made aware of the appropriate facts (see Table 8.1, pages 83-4 )."
9781910797471,ch05,"He has no history of ischemic heart disease or other cardiac symptoms . This is a typical presentation of decompensating chronic heart failure (HF) . Is this really HF? . Is there coronary artery disease? . Table 5.1 provides an overview of the factors that contribute to acute presentations . The onset of HF symptoms (Table 5.2) may be acute (typically with pulmonary edema, even with cardiogenic shock) or subacute . Both right and left HF may occur in the context of low output (fatigue, syncope and hypotension), and both right- and left-sided HF usually occur together . Assessment of functional class (see Table 2.1), based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic HF because it is linked to outcome - the annualized mortality in NYHA class IV HF is about 50%, which is four to five times that of class II and twice that of class III . The signs of HF are often subtle . The Framingham criteria for HF are shown in Table 5.4 . However, these features are ill-suited to the recognition of HF with preserved ejection fraction, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has proposed the incorporation of imaging findings in order to facilitate the recognition of HF in patients presenting with exercise intolerance alone (see Table 5.4) . Acute heart failure . The initial clinical picture of acute HF reflects the varying degree of impairment of cardiac output and elevation in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (obtained at left and right heart catheterization, respectively) . Patients with acute HF can present with one of several distinct hemodynamic profiles, based on the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold) (Figure 5.3) . More specific for acute HF is Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention . Arrhythmias may play a part in both acute and chronic HF . Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement . Although some patients die from progressive HF, ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF . Blood tests . In most patients, routine biochemistry includes blood tests for electrolytes and renal and liver function, a full blood count (to assess anemia) and evaluation of C-reactive protein levels if infection is suspected . Thyroid function tests and iron studies should be obtained at initial presentation in patients with cardiomyopathies . Type B natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels need only be assessed in the acute setting when echocardiography is not available and the diagnosis is in doubt . In such circumstances, levels of BNP lower than 100 pg/mL and NT-proBNP lower than 300 pg/mL would make the diagnosis of HF in patients with acute dyspnea highly unlikely (beware of patients with flash pulmonary edema or right ventricular [RV] dysfunction where the levels may be low) . Use of natriuretic peptide concentration in the diagnosis of HF in the non-acute setting is a novel indication and will require further validation (Figure 5.4) . An echocardiogram is appropriate at original diagnosis or if the patient deteriorates . Patients with HF who undergo echocardiography have significantly better outcomes than those who do not - presumably because of the initiation of appropriate therapy . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) . There are three major indications for CMR in HF . to supplement poor quality echocardiographic images (often due to obesity or chronic lung disease) . to assess myocardial scar burden . The use of CMR in HF is extremely variable between centers . Imaging for coronary disease and viable myocardium . The role of CAD should be considered in any patient with HF . Coronary investigation is often not indicated in young patients for whom there is a good alternative explanation for their symptoms; however, most patients with HF are elderly and in these patients coronary angiography may be considered if it is felt that the patient is a suitable candidate for a revascularization procedure . Coronary CT has been used in these circumstances, although calcification, which may preclude recognition of stenosis, should be expected in older patients . ","Assessment of functional class, based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic heart failure (HF) as it is linked to outcome. Also key to the diagnosis of HF is the assessment of ejection fraction, underlying etiology and precipitating factors, and the role of coronary artery disease. The hemodynamic profile of acute HF varies according to the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold). Atrial arrhythmias contribute to a reduction in functional capacity, while ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF. Investigations in patients with HF include blood tests, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and other imaging techniques. Functional testing is of particular value in patients deemed suitable candidates for devices or transplantation."
9781910797105,ch08,"Over the last 50 years, multiple neurotransmitter systems have been hypothesized to be involved in the neurochemistry of schizophrenia . These hypotheses have fallen in and out of vogue as our knowledge of the brain and our methods for investigating brain neurobiology have become more sophisticated . The dopamine hypothesis . Dopamine cell bodies exist in two areas: the hypothalamus and the midbrain . In the hypothalamus, dopamine controls pituitary prolactin release (tuberohypophyseal pathway) . The hypothesis was built on three observations . Second was the emergence of adverse effects of the recently discovered antipsychotic chlorpromazine, which mimicked Parkinson's disease, itself thought to be due to faulty dopamine transmission . Third was the observation that all effective antipsychotic agents were dopamine receptor antagonists . Four developments have helped to revive the dopamine hypothesis . First, the hypothesis was reformulated to predict the existence of both hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic activity in people with schizophrenia . D receptors are the most common and are always postsynaptic . D is related to the D -like family . The D family includes D, D and D . The development of more specific receptor ligands may lead to new information on the location and role of the different dopamine receptors . Third, more informative functional imaging approaches can now assess dopamine activity in vivo . The comparison of pre- and post-infusion radioligand occupancy provides an index of dopamine release and reuptake rates . The extent of dopamine release correlates with the severity of positive psychotic symptoms and also predicts how well a patient will respond to antipsychotic drug treatment . Another approach has examined the effects of antipsychotic drugs on dopamine D receptor occupancy . Finally, multiple studies have demonstrated that dopamine plays a central role in reward mechanisms, especially the mesolimbic projection to the nucleus accumbens . The role of glutamate . Although the dopamine hypothesis remains central, it has been found that a substantial proportion of people with schizophrenia do not adequately respond to dopamine antagonists . This suggests that other neurotransmitters are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . The glutamate hypothesis . Indirect evidence supports this hypothesis . PCP exerts its effect through blocking the ion channel gated by the NMDA receptor, which would initially produce a hypoglutamatergic state . In addition, long-term PCP administration results in depletion of prefrontal dopamine . One or more of these diverse effects may underlie the broad range of effects observed with NMDA receptor blockade . Evidence to support a glutamate hypothesis is growing . Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from clinical trials that have examined the efficacy of agents that modify the activity of the NMDA receptor . Treatment-resistant schizophrenia . It appears that people with TRS may have a different underlying pathology from that seen in responsive patients . Recent genetic research has shown that copy number variants (CNVs) involving glutamate pathways are over-represented in people with TRS . These TRS studies build on other evidence for a glutamate hypothesis . Does serotonin play a role? . Serotonergic neurons project from the RaphÃ© nucleus in the brainstem to the basal ganglia and the limbic, thalamic and cortical regions throughout the brain (Figure 8.4) . However, no direct supporting evidence has been found . What about acetylcholine? . Acetylcholine acts at muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors . These receptors are broadly distributed throughout the brain, including the neocortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia . The M muscarinic receptor and the alpha beta and alpha nicotinic receptors may be particularly important in the regulation of cognitive functions . Cholinergic mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of attention, memory, processing speed and sensory gating processes, which are all impaired in people with schizophrenia . The GABA system? . gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are extensively located on cerebral cortical interneurons and regulate cortical glutamatergic efferents . GABA receptors are also important in processing thalamic inputs to the cerebral cortex . Decreased GABAergic function may contribute to altered cortical function and the broad array of observed cognitive impairments . Other neurotransmitters . The multitude of neurochemical hypotheses points both to the possibility of multiple neurotransmitter systems being affected and the lack of definitive evidence for any one system . ",The dopamine hypothesis remains the major neurochemical hypothesis of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms are hypothesized to be due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Negative symptoms are hypothesized to be due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway. Altered glutamate activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of negative and positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. Disturbances in the cholinergic and GABAergic systems have been hypothesized to underlie cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

The symptoms of PTCL vary widely . In the COMPLETE study, 46% of patients presented with B symptoms . Skin rash may be present, particularly in patients with PTCL-NOS or AITL . Patients with AITL may also present with hypotension, fevers, rash and vasculitis-like symptoms, due to tumor-related cytokine release . Practice is likely to vary between centers . B symptoms should be evaluated and performance status determined . Fine needle aspirate is not sufficient for the diagnosis of T-cell lymphomas . DUSP22 and TP63 rearrangement studies should be considered in patients with ALK âˆ’ ALCL, as this may affect prognosis . Because 30% of PTCL-NOS cases show bone marrow involvement, a biopsy is recommended as part of initial staging in all patients . Practice is likely to vary between centers . The immunophenotypes of PTCL, TCR rearrangement and putative cell of origin are shown in Table 2.2 (page 19) . Specific markers may be relevant to the classification of particular T-cell lymphomas . The presence of at least three of the following markers indicates follicular T-helper cell origin: CD10, BCL-6, CXCL13, PD1, SAP, ICOS and CCR5; however, morphology should also be evaluated before diagnosing AITL . CD21 and/or CD23 are useful in revealing follicular dendritic cells in AITL . CD30 is always positive in ALCL, which is invariably PAX5 âˆ’ and often EMA +, and one-third of cases are CD45 âˆ’ . CD30 is variably positive in selected patients with other types of T-cell lymphoma, including EATL, AITL and PTCL-NOS . CD20 and PAX5 allow the identification of B-cell components and can help in distinguishing ALK âˆ’ ALCL from morphologically aggressive classic Hodgkin lymphoma (PAX5 +) with anaplastic features . EBV may be detected in a subset of patients with PTCL-NOS, AITL and in all cases of ENKTCL . TCR clonality is negative in 20% of AITL cases, likely to be because of low tumor burden and contamination by non-malignant stromal cells . ALK + ALCL with small cell morphology (5-10% of cases) can be confused with CD30 + PTCL-NOS if ALK staining is not performed . Up to 30% of AITL cases may demonstrate clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements but this does not fulfil the criteria for a composite B-cell lymphoma . Composite diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with AITL should be considered in the presence of sheet-like growth of large monoclonal B cells . Hodgkin-like or Reed-Sternberg-like cells in AITL can mimic classic Hodgkin lymphoma . These cells are activated, usually EBV +, B cells . Staging and grading . Low-grade T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is uncommon and not well described . The clinical stage depends on where malignant tissue is identified and the presence of systemic B symptoms . PTCL is usually aggressive, and outcomes are generally poor compared with aggressive B-cell lymphomas . For example, the International T-cell Lymphoma study reported overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival of 10% at 10-15 years in patients with PTCL-NOS . Retrospective univariate analysis of data from 385 PTCL-NOS cases identified factors associated with worse OS as . stage III or IV disease . T cell score . The International T cell Project, established by the International Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Project in 2006, reported this new prognostic model in 2018 . ","Many patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas present with systemic symptoms, and extranodal involvement is common. Detailed immunophenotypic analysis is necessary to accurately diagnose PTCL subtypes. PET scanning can be helpful to diagnose extranodal disease. The International Prognostic Index and the PTCL-specific index are useful prognostic tools. Epstein-Barr virus and CD30 are expressed in several subtypes of PTCL."
9781910797495,chp9,"Pain in patients with cancer may present as various types of pain at different stages of the patient's journey with cancer . Thus, the pain may comprise acute, recurrent or chronic presentations due to the cancer and/or its treatment . Assessment of pain in patients with cancer should be the same as in other patients with pain (see Chapter 2), so that the widest possible range of treatments can be considered, with the aim of optimal treatment . Also, patients with cancer may have pre-existing chronic pain that continues, in addition to cancer pain (Table 9.1) . Finally, patients with cancer require particular strategies during the end-of-life stage . The choice of treatment options is based on similar considerations to those for patients with chronic non-cancer pain . Unfortunately, the prevalence of pain is high in patients with cancer: 20-50% at the time of diagnosis; 50% during the treatment phase; 75-90% during the advanced cancer phase . Many studies report that unrelieved cancer pain is associated with interference with several dimensions of quality of life of the patients and their caregivers . However, variability in presentation of pain and its treatment (see Tables 9.1 and 9.2) make it essential to carefully evaluate each patient regardless of the cancer type . Acute pain occurs in patients with cancer after surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy . After one or more of these treatments is finished, a percentage of patients progress to persistent pain (chronic pain), often caused by nerve damage from the treatments themselves . Risk factors in patients after cancer surgery are similar to those for any surgery (see Table 8.2) . The incidence of such pain is given in Table 8.1 . It is likely that the risk of persistent pain is higher in patients who also receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, in addition to surgery . Many such pains improve with treatment of the cancer, but some will proceed to a chronic version of the acute presentation (Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . However, many patients have multiple pain sites and pain types: for example, a high percentage (30-40%) have muscle pain in addition to cancer-related pain . Diagnosing non-cancer pain is important as it emphasizes to patients the lack of a one-to-one relationship between the stage of cancer and the presence and severity of pain . Metastatic spread of cancer to bone is the most common cause of cancer pain (Figure 9.1) . Yet chronic cancer pain is a nociceptive mosaic; pain may be due to tumor infiltration of nerves (neuropathic pain) or other tissues (somatic or visceral pain), or may be related to the treatment or procedure that the patient receives . Thus, regardless of the initial cause of pain, central sensitization can play a key role in cancer pain (see Chapter 1) . As with all chronic pain, psychosocial factors are of profound importance in patients with cancer pain (see Table 9.5) . The same principles of pain assessment as described in Chapter 2 apply to patients with cancer pain . However, in this scenario, it is crucial to establish whether the pain is related to the cancer itself, the associated treatments or other conditions (see Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . Thus, patients should be asked about the onset of pain - whether it was present before the cancer or associated with the initiation of treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy - and whether it has progressed . Table 9.6 summarizes the aspects of assessment that require particular emphasis in patients with cancer . A comprehensive assessment (see Chapter 2 and Table 9.6) is essential in identifying the basis of the pain in individual cancer patients (Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . This is particularly important for 'cancer survivors' with chronic pain . Many of the preceding chapters describe pain conditions and treatments that are applicable to both non-cancer pain and cancer pain, with treatments in the areas of pharmacology, physical therapy, psychological strategies, interventional treatments and other options . The main treatments for cancer pain are summarized in Chapter 3 . patient education about pain . cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) . Treatment of the cancer itself . In addition, if feasible, treatment of the cancer itself, with chemotherapy, surgery, external radiotherapy and/or radionuclide therapy is potentially a primary option for reducing pain . Thus, there needs to be a detailed discussion about the risks and benefits of treatment . External radiotherapy employs ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells . ","Cancer pain is a nociceptive mosaic in which pain may arise from inflammation, tumor infiltration of nerves (neuropathic pain) or other tissues (visceral or somatic pain), treatment, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and from other psychological and environmental factors. Treatment of the cancer itself (by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery etc.) is a primary option in cancer pain management; however, such treatment may be the cause of pain (especially neuropathic pain). Opioids are the foundation for management of cancer pain of moderate to severe intensity, but other drugs should also be considered depending on the pain conditions and mechanisms involved (exempli gratia neuropathic, myofascial, arthritic); however, treatment of cancer pain should not rely on drugs alone, since there are many other options that will produce good results. Psychological therapies that promote 'self-help' strategies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and meditation/relaxation, as well as integrative treatments such as massage and acupuncture, are often useful as part of a multimodal treatment approach to support patients with cancer pain and related symptoms. Radiotherapy is effective for pain from bone metastases. Neural blockade can be used for isolated pain-causing lesions."
9781912776726,ch2,"Most patients with glioblastoma present with a clinical history of 3-6 months, although a small proportion have rapid onset of symptoms, clinically similar to a stroke . Treatment of the key signs and symptoms is described in Chapter 5 . Signs and symptoms . The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of surrounding brain tissue and secondarily from the effects of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the tumor and edema . There is no fixed pattern of symptom progression; specific signs and symptoms will vary from person to person depending on the area of the brain that is affected (see Typical locations, Table 1.1) . Patients commonly experience focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, sensory loss or visual field defects, reflecting the location of the tumor . Patients with frontal tumors often present with cognitive deficits, a change in personality or a mood disorder and are often mistakenly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder . Five percent of patients present with aphasia due to a tumor in the speech-dominant hemisphere, which may be mistaken for confusion or delirium . Patients with larger tumors may also experience incontinence and difficulties with gait due to mass effect . Around 20-40% of patients present with seizures, which are most commonly associated with tumors of the temporal lobe . Up to 50% of patients have seizures later in the disease course . These may be simple partial seizures, where the electrical disturbance is limited to a specific area of one cerebral hemisphere and consciousness is retained, or complex partial seizures, in which consciousness is impaired or lost . Partial seizures may spread to cause a generalized seizure, classified as partial seizures secondarily generalized . Raised intracranial pressure can occur as a result of increasing tumor size and surrounding edema . Headaches due to raised ICP occur in up to 50% of patients . Patients may also present with other symptoms of raised ICP, such as nausea, vomiting and papilledema . Symptom prevalence . A systematic review identified symptom prevalence in patients at different stages of their glioma treatment . Glioblastoma is grade IV disease and so is not formally staged . The most common symptoms are shown in Table 2.1; other symptoms included alopecia, anorexia, anxiety/depression, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, gait disturbance, nausea/vomiting, pain, right-left confusion, sensory deficits, skin problems, urinary incontinence and visual defects . Eight of the ten most prevalent symptoms shown in Table 2.1 (excluding confusion and dysphagia) are included in at least two of the three assessment tools for patient-reported outcome measures: the brain cancer-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BN20), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) module . These instruments are mostly used in clinical trials or research studies as a means of monitoring disease trajectory and the effect of treatments on quality of life and symptoms (Figure 2.1) . They are important, as good symptom management has been shown to improve survival in other diseases such as lung cancer; however, symptoms are predominantly caused by the tumor, and to a lesser degree by the treatment . Note: these may occur at different phases in the disease trajectory (see Figure 2.1) . Confusion (40.3%), dysphagia (41.9%) and dyspnea (17.7%) are more prevalent at the end of life than during diagnosis, treatment and follow-up . A higher prevalence of confusion is seen at the end of life in patients with primary brain tumors than in patients with brain metastases or a general palliative care population . Aside from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life in cancer, such as anorexia and weight loss, tend to occur less often in patients with glioma than in other patients receiving palliative care . A study that compared 65 patients with glioblastoma at postsurgical baseline versus 130 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, reported that patients with glioblastoma frequently experience fatigue, suggesting that factors other than those related to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, such as depression and tumor localization, have a significant impact . Thus, patients require tailored symptom care at different times during the course of their disease . ","The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of the surrounding brain tissue and from the effects of increased intracranial pressure due to increasing tumor size and surrounding edema. The most prevalent symptoms of glioblastoma are neurological in nature. Apart from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life (exempli gratia anorexia, weight loss) in patients receiving palliative care for other forms of cancer are less common in patients with glioblastoma. Seizures and cognitive deficits tend to be seen throughout the trajectory of the disease. Headache and dizziness are more common in the early diagnostic phase, and nausea/vomiting, visual deficits and anorexia are more prevalent during treatment. Confusion, dysphagia, dyspnea, aphasia, drowsiness and fatigue are more prevalent at the end of life. The trajectory of the disease varies widely from patient to patient depending on the location of the tumor and other patient- and treatment-related factors. Patients with glioblastoma should be treated on an individual basis according to their symptom burden at different phases of the disease course."
9781910797815,chp2,"Population-based epidemiology data are heterogeneous, possibly reflecting the changing classification of the disorders over time, misdiagnoses and problems with case ascertainment . However, recent meta-analyses and population-based registry studies have provided useful insights into the epidemiology of the MPNs . Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are the most common MPNs and, together with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), account for about one-third of all newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies . The incidence and prevalence of these MPNs has been investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 studies conducted worldwide . The crude annual incidence for the MPNs combined was 2.58 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval 1.90-3.50), with individual studies yielding rates of 1.15-4.99 per 100 000 (Table 2.1) . ET had the highest incidence, followed by PV and PMF . In general, incidence was similar in men and women in the systematic review, although the incidence of ET was numerically higher in women (Table 2.1) . By contrast, real-world data from the UK population-based Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) show that age-standardized incidence is similar for ET, PV and MPN, unclassifiable, whereas myelofibrosis is approximately twice as common in men as in women . Most of the available epidemiology data are from Europe and North America; the incidence of the MPNs is similar in these two regions, as shown in Table 2.2 . The meta-analysis also showed that the MPNs are rare in children and adolescents . The pooled annual incidence in children aged <=16 years was 0.003 per 100 000 for PMF and 0.004-0.11 per 100 000 for ET; no data on pediatric PV were reported . One North American study reported an overall prevalence for all chronic MPNs in the general population of 93.3 per 100 000 . Prevalence in the UK reported by the HMRN is shown in Table 2.3 . In general, the prevalence of each condition is similar in men and women . In general, patients with ET or PV have a near-normal life expectancy with current treatment strategies, whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival . The UK HMRN has reported 3-year relative survival rates of more than 90% in patients with the chronic MPNs (ET, PV, MPN, unclassifiable) compared with fewer than 70% in those with myelofibrosis (Figure 2.1) . However, the emergence of new and improved treatments in recent years has markedly improved survival rates . For example, the introduction of phlebotomy as a routine treatment for PV increased median survival from less than 2 years to approximately 14 years . Risk factors . Genetic predisposition . In addition to the presence of the driver mutations described in Chapter 1, age is a predominant risk factor for the MPNs . In the UK HMRN study, the median age at diagnosis in people with chronic MPNs was 70-74 years (Table 2.4) . PV tended to be diagnosed at an earlier age in men than in women . An estimated 7-8% of individuals with apparently sporadic MPN have a family history with at least two cases of MPN, as illustrated in Figure 2.2 . Such familial cases are presumed to be due to acquisition of the somatic driver mutation through a genetic predisposition . To date, familial MPN has been identified in only a small number of families; however, identification of such cases may facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate intervention . Other risk factors for the MPNs have been proposed (Table 2.5), although in many cases the supporting evidence is limited . Two major long-term epidemiology studies have reported strong evidence that increased body mass index and smoking have significant associations with some or all of the MPNs . ","The incidence of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is approximately 2.6 per 100 000. Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is the most common, with an incidence of approximately 1.0 per 100 000, followed by polycythemia vera (PV) (0.8) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (0.5). Recent data from the UK suggest that the incidence of ET and PV is similar in men and women, whereas PMF is twice as common in men. MPNs primarily affect older individuals: the median age at diagnosis is 70-74 years. ET and PV are associated with near-normal life expectancy whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. Risk factors that may increase the risk of MPNs include higher body mass index, smoking and some occupational exposures."
9781910797433,ch05,"In patients with presumed early disease, the aim of surgery is to remove the primary tumor, along with adequate peritoneal and lymphogenic staging . In advanced disease, the aim is to achieve maximal cytoreduction and tumor reduction . Surgery for primary ovarian cancer . Depending on the histological grade and tumor subtype, up to 30% of patients with apparently early epithelial ovarian cancer will be upstaged after comprehensive peritoneal and lymph node staging . Fertility-sparing surgery should be considered and discussed in younger patients and those with early-stage disease . Patients with stage IA ovarian cancer and favorable histology (low-grade mucinous, serous, endometrioid or mixed histology) have been shown to have a lower risk after fertility-preserving surgery than patients with a higher disease stage or tumor grade . In advanced stages, maximal cytoreduction aimed at achieving complete tumor clearance has been shown to be associated with significant increases in both overall and progression-free survival . A meta-analysis of 53 studies and 6885 patients, from 1989 to 1998, showed that every 10% reduction in tumor was associated with a 6.3% prolongation of median overall survival . Resection techniques . extensive peritoneal stripping . full thickness diaphragmatic resection . bowel resection . Extra-abdominal cytoreductive procedures are increasingly being used to achieve complete tumor clearance outside the abdominal cavity . Surgical expertise and training, with continuous audit of surgical outcome, morbidity and survival, have been proven to be important tools in making such extensive surgery safe for the patient without unnecessarily increasing morbidity . Timing of surgery . Cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer is generally performed at the time of diagnosis, when it is referred to as primary cytoreduction . It is also performed during primary chemotherapy, when it is referred to as interval cytoreduction, and after disease recurrence, which is called secondary or tertiary cytoreduction . The optimal timing of surgery in relation to first-line chemotherapy is still under debate . Surgery for relapsed ovarian cancer . Despite the established value of cytoreduction in the primary tumor setting, the value of tumor debulking surgery for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is not well defined . Secondary cytoreduction . The DESKTOP I trial retrospectively evaluated the survival benefit of secondary debulking in patients with ovarian cancer, sensitive to platinum chemotherapy . Complete tumor resection increased survival, compared with those with residual tumor (median 45.2 versus 19.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-6.05, p < 0.0001) . Using these data, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie (AGO) determined that complete tumor resection was feasible in patients with recurrent disease provided they had . complete resection at primary surgery, or early FIGO stage (I/II) . absence of gross ascites at relapse . Similar findings have been reported in other patient series . A meta-analysis of data from 40 patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, spanning 24 years, showed that after controlling for all other disease-related factors, every 10% increase in the proportion of patients undergoing complete cytoreductive surgery was associated with a 3-month increase in median cohort survival time . The most frequent tumor dissemination site was the pelvis (73%) . In total, 224 patients (54.1%) underwent complete tumor resection . This study confirmed that - even in the tertiary setting - complete macroscopic tumor clearance is a significant predictor of both overall and progression-free survival . Median overall survival for patients without residual tumor was 49 months (95% CI 42.5-56.4) compared with 12 months (95% CI 9.3-14.7) in patients with residual tumor (p < 0.001) . By contrast, peritoneal carcinomatosis was not prognostic for survival after controlling for residual tumor status . Multivariate analysis identified platinum resistance, residual tumor at secondary surgery and peritoneal carcinomatosis to be of predictive significance for complete tumor resection, while residual tumor at secondary and tertiary surgery, decreasing time to second relapse, ascites, upper abdominal tumor involvement and non-platinum third-line chemotherapy significantly affected overall survival . ","Surgery is one of the cornerstones of treatment for ovarian cancer. The key aims of surgery are tumor removal and accurate staging. Multivisceral surgery is needed to achieve complete tumor resection. Surgery for relapsed disease is associated with significant prolongation of progression-free survival in prospective studies; data for overall survival are not yet mature, but in retrospective series patients who are tumor free after surgery at relapse have significantly longer overall survival than those with residual tumor. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is associated with lower complete debulking rates at relapse, but not with inferior overall survival in tumor-free patients who undergo surgery."
9781910797617,chp1,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that affects the blood and bone marrow . Complications also arise directly from the proliferation and accumulation of immature leukemia cells, which can affect blood flow or infiltrate other organs . The pathogenesis is described in more detail on page 9 . The incidence of AML in the USA is 4.2 per 100 000 per year, with an estimated 21 380 new cases in 2017 . Annual incidence rates differ little between large datasets from the USA (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results), the UK (Cancer Research UK), and Sweden (Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry) . Data from developing countries are sparse . AML is rare compared with other cancers, but is the most common acute leukemia in adults . Age, sex and ethnicity . AML is slightly more common in men than women, particularly in the older age groups . It is more commonly diagnosed in developed countries and is more common in white than in other populations . AML is universally fatal if untreated . Even with treatment, patients seldom survive long term: according to US registry data, only 27% of patients survive 5 years from diagnosis . Survival is particularly poor in older patients, with fewer than 10% surviving 5 years . This is attributed to a marked increase in intrinsic chemoresistance with age and a greater number of comorbidities that compromise tolerance to chemotherapy . Figure 1.2 shows overall survival estimates by age group for patients in the Swedish registry . Clonal immature myeloid progenitor cells accumulate in the blood, bone marrow and, occasionally, extramedullary tissues . While these cells can divide and proliferate, they do not differentiate (mature) into functional cells (id est neutrophils) . Most patients with AML die from infection or, to a lesser extent, hemorrhage . The role of genetics . Advances in genetics have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML . Although in-depth understanding of the relationship between a specific genetic mutation and a specific pathophysiological or clinical feature is clear in only a few cases, this is slowly changing . The PML-RARA fusion gene is typically detected as a chromosomal rearrangement: t(15;17)(q22;q21) . The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development . In normal cells, RARA encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors; PML is important in controlling proliferation and apoptosis, among other processes . The PML-RARA fusion protein suppresses gene transcription and blocks differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage, resulting in the accumulation of malignant promyelocytes seen in APL . Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage . The complex role of the PML-RARA fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood . For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (cancergenome . However, the final insults that subsequently direct premalignant blood cells to become leukemic are many and remain poorly understood . Several datasets have grouped mutations into categories in an attempt to understand these relationships . One clone may be eliminated over time (and following treatment), whereas another may persist or emerge with additional novel mutations . Figure 1.8 illustrates clonal evolution in an actual patient . Mutational analyses like these explain why patients with morphologically similar leukemias may experience vastly different clinical outcomes . Several recent successful examples of this treatment approach are discussed in detail in Chapter 3 . Most cases of AML are idiopathic, arising in previously healthy individuals with no (or unknown) genetic predisposition . Familial risk . Affected patients have favorable clinical outcomes but require lower doses of chemotherapy because of higher treatment-related toxicities . Each of these syndromes has unique clinical features and atypical toxicities after chemotherapy, requiring expert care . Chemical and environmental exposure . Anticancer drugs are the leading cause of therapy-associated AML . Myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms . ","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relatively rare cancer. It is due to proliferation of immature myeloid cells, which interfere with the production of normal red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients typically require transfusion support and are at risk for potentially fatal infection. AML is uniformly fatal without treatment. AML is the most common acute leukemia in older adults, with median age at diagnosis of 67-69 years. Long-term survival of patients with AML is poor: about a quarter of patients survive 5 years but only 10% of older patients. Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time. Most cases of AML are idiopathic; however, prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents increases the risk of AML. Inherited risk is uncommon but is likely to be more frequent than is currently understood."

Pregnancy produces cutaneous signs associated with chronic liver disease, including palmar erythema and spider nevi . alkaline phosphatase increases from the seventh month to term . Pregnancy-related liver dysfunction . Severe vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy may be associated with abnormal liver function tests, typically a modest elevation in the serum aminotransferases (up to five times the upper limit of normal) and possibly an increased serum bilirubin . The abnormalities resolve with rehydration and control of the vomiting, and no specific therapy is required for the liver . Cholestasis of pregnancy complicates up to 1% of pregnancies and accounts for 20% of cases of jaundice during pregnancy . Jaundice subsequently develops in association with pale stools and dark urine . The liver function profile shows a marked increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and possibly hyperbilirubinemia . Management involves control of the pruritus with colestyramine (cholestyramine) or ursodeoxycholic acid . Cholestasis is likely to recur in subsequent pregnancies and with subsequent use of the oral contraceptive pill . Acute fatty liver of pregnancy presents in the third trimester and is most common in first pregnancies and with a male fetus . The incidence is also increased with twin pregnancies . Severe cases develop features of acute liver failure (jaundice, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy) in association with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure . The liver function profile shows increased serum bilirubin in association with a mild-to-moderate increase in serum aminotransferases . The fatty infiltration of the liver may be apparent on ultrasonography or computed tomography of the liver . Termination of the pregnancy is central to successful management of the condition - clinical improvement is usually apparent within 24 hours of delivery . Severe cases require intravenous fluids, antibiotics and supportive measures for liver and renal insufficiency . The prognosis is good, even in severe cases, and rescue with emergency liver transplantation is only occasionally needed . The frequency and severity of liver dysfunction increase with the severity of the syndrome . The dominant abnormality is in the serum aminotransferases, which may be very high and in the range associated with acute hepatitis . Acute liver failure, hepatic infarction and rupture are all recognized complications . Renal failure and thrombocytopenia are other common features of severe disease .

There is considerable overlap between this syndrome and hypertension-related liver dysfunction, and management is effectively the same as for the latter condition (see above) . Pre-existing liver disease . However, this has not been clearly demonstrated to be the case, and even the stresses of vaginal delivery are not associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage .

However, primary biliary cirrhosis may deteriorate during pregnancy . Coincidental acute liver disease . Acute viral hepatitis . The clinical courses of hepatitis A and B are unaltered by pregnancy, but mortality is increased with hepatitis E . Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of increased risk for the development of hepatic vein thrombosis in susceptible individuals . Pregnancy facilitates the development of gallstones, which are found in up to 10% of pregnant women . Biliary obstruction should be managed endoscopically rather than surgically during the pregnancy . Acute liver failure, unrelated to the pregnancy, may develop after deliberate or accidental paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, infection with hepatitis E or other coincidental reasons . Maternal care is standard for the condition, and successful liver transplants during pregnancy have been reported . Surveillance during pregnancy is recommended because of the associated stimulus to growth .

9781908541796,chapter1,"Consequently, it is difficult to present an all-encompassing overview of the epidemiology of lymphoma . Incidence and relevant factors . In the USA, Europe and Australasia the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is approximately 20 per 100 000 of the population, with a slightly higher incidence in men than in women . This makes lymphoma the sixth or seventh most common cancer worldwide . Overall, incidence increases with age, although some subtypes of lymphoma are more common in children and young adults (Table 1.1) . Although the overall incidence is 50% higher in men, the sexes are not equally affected by all lymphoma entities . For example, mantle cell lymphoma particularly affects men (> 70% of cases), whereas primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is more common in women . In the USA, the incidence of NHL is 50% higher in non-Hispanic white Americans than black Americans . However, in the UK, epidemiological data in white, Asian and black populations indicate no significant variation in incidence by ethnicity . It has long been recognized that certain forms of lymphoma have an increased incidence in certain parts of the world (Figure 1.1) . Overall, NHL is most common in the USA, Western Europe and Australia (possibly reflecting the age demographics of these populations) . However, Hodgkin lymphoma is considerably more common in the Middle East, with incidence rates almost double those of Western Europe . Changes in incidence . Recent age-adjusted data in the USA (and UK) suggest, however, that since 1990 the incidence of NHL has plateaued . Interestingly, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma has also been stable . Research into the reasons why the incidence of lymphoma increased so dramatically has failed to provide convincing answers . Risk factors . Possible risk factors for lymphoma can be divided into two broad categories . relatively uncommon risk factors that carry a high relative risk . common risk factors that carry a low relative risk . Relatively uncommon risk factors with high relative risk . Immuno-deficiency states are the most obvious examples of a relatively uncommon risk factor that carries a high relative risk . It has been suggested that the rising incidence of lymphoma during the 1980s and 1990s reflected an increasing incidence of immunodeficiency, most obviously due to the emergence of HIV and AIDS . Indeed, HIV/AIDS has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of lymphoma, but it accounts for less than 50% of the increase in incidence seen in the West . Furthermore, since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of AIDS-associated lymphoma has declined . Common risk factors with low relative risk . Many environmental factors have been implicated in the development of lymphoma (see below) . However, it must be remembered that a relatively innocuous environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk of developing lymphoma can contribute substantially to a rising incidence if a sufficiently large number of people are exposed . Nevertheless, it is not possible to test for every environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk . Environmental causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Immunosuppression has two relatively common causes . HIV infection increases the risk of developing NHL more than 100-fold . The lymphomas are generally aggressive: either diffuse large B-cell or Burkitt type (see Chapter 8) . A dominant B-cell clone can then evolve, resulting in lymphoma (see Chapter 8) . Infection (other than HIV) may be an acquired cause of lymphoma (Tables 1.2 and 1.3) . However, the results are inconsistent with wide variations in the estimates of risk . Only a small (and therefore difficult to demonstrate) relative risk may account for a significant proportion of lymphoma cases . Blood transfusion . Increased use of blood transfusions has coincided with the increased incidence of lymphoma . However, results from cohort and case-control studies are conflicting . Genetic causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Only a few inherited conditions predispose to lymphoma development . In each case, a cofactor such as EBV is needed for lymphoma development . More subtle defects in immunoregulation are also hypothesized to increase the risk of NHL . ","The epidemiology of lymphoma is difficult to study owing to the existence of so many different subtypes of the disease, each with its own epidemiology and associated causative factors. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s but has plateaued in recent years. An understanding of the epidemiology has, in some instances, led to an understanding of causative factors such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Various other subtypes of lymphoma have been linked with infection, particularly immunosuppression-related lymphomas caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas caused by various bacterial infections. Large cohort studies are required to verify many of the potential causative factors."
9781908541963,chapter2,"There are three major categories of acute liver disease . vascular disease . The associated symptoms and biochemical profiles differentiate between these patterns of disease (Table 2.1) . Acute liver failure . A coagulopathy is invariably present . PT rises and the bilirubin rockets upwards . Many of these patients will die unless they receive a liver transplant . Sepsis and circulatory failure account for most other deaths . The development of renal failure also indicates a poorer prognosis . Specific prognostic models are used in specialist centers to determine prognosis and the need for liver transplantation . A number of easily recognizable scenarios that are associated with either a favorable or unfavorable outcome are given in Table 2.3 . More precise definition of the site of the obstruction is then obtained by endoscopic or magnetic resonance cholangiography . Paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose induces a distinct pattern of acute liver failure . Later administration of N -acetylcysteine may also modify the severity of the disease . Hemolytic anemia and ascites early in the course of the disease are characteristics of Wilson's disease . The dominant clinical features are jaundice and pruritus . Other features include dark urine and pale stools, and weight loss may be considerable . The duration of the cholestatic episode is variable but it can last for many months . Drug-induced cholestasis is likely to recur with repeated exposure to the offending agent . Cholestasis may herald Hodgkin's lymphoma as a paraneoplastic syndrome . Vascular disease . The liver function profile shows modest elevation in the serum bilirubin and aminotransferases . Most cases have an underlying procoagulant state that may be occult . The most frequent associations are . factor V Leiden . JAK3 gene mutation . antiphospholipid antibody syndrome . essential thrombocythemia . polycythemia rubra vera . antithrombin III deficiency . protein C or S deficiency . paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . The diagnosis is suggested by failure to demonstrate patent hepatic veins on ultrasonography or CT scanning and is confirmed by direct venography . A liver biopsy may be useful in identifying long-standing cases, and may reveal significant fibrosis or cirrhosis . Management is similar to that of Budd-Chiari syndrome . The serum bilirubin level increases as the aminotransferase levels fall . The severity of the acute hepatitis is reflected in three clinical categories . uncomplicated hepatitis . severe hepatitis . acute liver failure . This is usually followed by the onset of jaundice, although this is not always the case in young children . The prodromal symptoms characteristically improve once jaundice develops . The jaundice resolves over variable periods but usually within 6 weeks of onset . Lethargy may be profound and persist for months after the jaundice has cleared . Hepatitis A is contracted by the orofecal route . Hepatitis B is contracted by vertical transmission, sexual exposure and contact with infected blood . Vertical transmission occurs at birth and is the main route of infection in highly endemic areas . Vaccination is effective in preventing infection in over 95% of individuals . Target populations for vaccination include healthcare workers and men who have sex with men . This entity occurs particularly in patients developing acute liver failure . Although assumed to be viral, this condition has a propensity for middle-aged women and does not occur in clusters . Unrecognized toxins or autoimmune processes are alternative explanations . Hepatitis C and E . The natural history is similar to that of hepatitis A . However, hepatitis E is associated with a peculiarly high mortality in pregnant women . There is no effective vaccine for hepatitis C or hepatitis E . Rapid diagnosis is important because of the potential for effective treatment with penicillin in the early phase . Characteristic features include fever, hemorrhagic skin rash and renal dysfunction . Other causes . Autoimmune hepatitis may present for the first time with an episode of florid hepatitis . ","Attempt to classify acute liver disease as hepatitis (most common), cholestatic (intermediate) or vascular (unusual). Simple blood tests and an ultrasound examination provide most of the information required. Hypoglycemia, coagulopathy and any evidence of confusion indicate a high risk of acute liver failure and the need for specialist care. Coagulopathy in cholestatic disorders responds to parenteral vitamin K."
9781910797907,chp2,"Despite being the best studied of the glycolytic enzyme disorders, gaps remain in our understanding of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency . More than 600 cases of PK deficiency have been reported, mainly from Europe, the USA and Japan, but the disease occurs worldwide, and it is likely that many cases go unreported . This may be because affected individuals die before birth, or because cases are mild and do not require medical attention . Alternatively, some cases may not be properly recognized, or they may be misdiagnosed . Given that some cases may not present with any of the findings usually associated with the condition, there are likely to be more cases of PK deficiency than are published in the literature . Patient registries have now been developed for PK deficiency, which are helping to characterize the range of symptoms and complications arising from this disorder . Prevalence of pyruvate kinase deficiency . PK deficiency occurs equally in men and women . A study in northern England observed a prevalence of 3.3 cases of PK deficiency per million in a mainly white population . Gene frequency studies have estimated the prevalence of PK deficiency in the general white population to be 51 cases per million . In Germany and the USA, it has been estimated that about 1% of the population are heterozygous for PK deficiency, while a study from Hong Kong found that 3% of newborn infants were heterozygous for a particular PK variant . Because PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, individuals who are heterozygous for a single PK mutation will not show clinical signs of hemolysis or anemia . For this reason, prevalence estimates based on the observation of clinically affected patients will be substantially lower than those based on the prevalence of heterozygotes in a population . The Amish community in Pennsylvania, USA, has a particularly high frequency of PK deficiency, associated with one specific mutation, which can be traced back to a single immigrant couple . An increased incidence has also been reported in children from a polygamist community in the western USA, again associated with a particular mutation . Mutations associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency . As discussed in Chapter 1, mutations in the PKLR gene on chromosome 1 are responsible for PK deficiency . More than 300 different mutations have been reported; most are very rare, occurring only once . Currently, about 25% of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency appear to have a previously unrecorded mutation . Although many of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are rare, a few are recorded more frequently (Table 2.1) . The variability in how PK deficiency manifests is thought to reflect the heterogeneity of these causative mutations, as well as the fact that most individuals with PK deficiency will be compound heterozygotes (id est they will have a different mutation in each copy of the PKLR gene) . Approximately 70% of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense (M) mutations (id est a single nucleotide change resulting in the production of a different amino acid), while the others are more disruptive non-missense (NM) mutations - either nonsense or insertional mutations, deletions (such as the deletion of exon 11 found in the Romany population), or splicing abnormalities (see pages 43 -) . Genotype-phenotype relationship . Current research is focusing on the relationship between specific mutations in the PKLR gene and the severity of hemolysis . Given the sheer number of different mutations and the predominance of compound heterozygotes, studies of the relationship between genotype and phenotype have grouped patients by type of mutation (id est two missense mutations [M/M], one missense and one non-missense mutation [M/NM], or two non-missense mutations [NM/NM]) . Findings so far suggest that individuals with more disruptive (non-missense) mutations are more severely affected; they have lower levels of hemoglobin and require more frequent transfusions and a greater total transfusion volume . They also have a higher rate of splenectomy and a higher frequency of iron overload (see pages 43 -) . Acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency . While almost all cases of PK deficiency are inherited and result from mutations in the PKLR gene, an acquired form of the deficiency can very rarely occur secondarily to other blood diseases, such as acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory sideroblastic anemia . Acquired PK deficiency can also result from complications associated with chemotherapy . ",Gaps remain in our understanding of the epidemiology of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency because many cases are believed to go unreported. About one quarter of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency will have a previously unrecorded mutation in the PKLR gene. Approximately 70% of mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense mutations. Some mutations are seen more frequently in specific regions and populations. Acquired PK deficiency very rarely can occur secondarily to other blood diseases.
9781908541666,ch_9,"Principles of dietary management . Thus, there is an inability of the body to produce sufficient insulin to meet requirements . Lipid disorders often accompany type 2 diabetes, and hypertension or renal disease may also require specific dietary instructions . The fundamentals of diet in diabetes . Dietary recommendations for the last 30 years in diabetes mellitus have emphasized a diet low in saturated fat . Glycemic index . Low GI carbohydrates generally have a high fiber content, which apparently slows the absorption of glucose from the gut . There is great variability in the individual response to 'low GI' foods, however . Thus, as in all food groups, quantity matters . Balance of macronutrients . More recently, it has been accepted that different dietary approaches are also appropriate in type 2 diabetes . Specifically, accepted macronutrient content has become more flexible . The first change was the acceptance that different types of fats were not necessarily as harmful as saturated fat . Studies have shown that a higher intake of fat from monounsaturated fat sources improves the glycemic and lipid profiles . Sources of monounsaturated fats include olive and canola oil, avocados and some nuts . The second change has been the acceptance that lower carbohydrate and higher protein intakes are acceptable and beneficial in type 2 diabetes . Protein sources should remain low in saturated fat . Postmeal glucose testing can help to determine the appropriate premeal insulin dose . It is outside the scope of this chapter to discuss carbohydrate portion size extensively . Care needs to be exercised not to increase total energy intake substantially, otherwise weight gain may occur . Weight loss . A desire to lose weight is common in many patients with type 2 diabetes . There are numerous weight-loss approaches for obese patients with diabetes . Energy restriction . Reduce energy-dense foods . These can undermine a patient's attempts to restrict energy intake and may worsen their glucose control . They are found on most foods, depending on laws within individual countries . Patients may need support to interpret food labels and identify energy-dense foods . By acquiring knowledge of food labels and composition, healthcare professionals can help patients navigate this potentially confusing area . These might be labeled as 'natural fruit juice', fructose, corn or maize starch, to name a few . These additions increase the energy density of the food and again can undermine energy restriction targets and glucose control . Reduction of meal size is a further simple instruction to reduce energy intake . Avoiding hypoglycemia . Very low energy diets . Programs using this approach have been found to be successful and safe in the longer term . Many products are available from a variety of commercial sources . With prolonged use (longer than 12 weeks) iron and vitamin B levels should be checked . Bariatric surgery in type 2 diabetes . Recent studies indicate that weight loss with the aid of bariatric surgery will restore glucose metabolism . More recently, gastric banding plus a supported lifestyle program was found to normalize glucose metabolism in 75% of subjects at 2 years . Centers offering surgery without this or patients reluctant to participate in follow-up may not reach these levels of success . Patients benefit from support from an expert in the specific dietary requirements following bariatric surgery . Again, because of the energy restriction that occurs after surgery, adjustment of hypoglycemic agents is necessary . Physical activity . Increasing physical activity is a cornerstone in the management of diabetes mellitus . Physical activity is also essential in strategies to maintain or reduce weight . A prescription of 40 minutes of walking per day is reasonable, to be accrued over several sessions . This needs to be tempered by consideration of physical disability and underlying fitness . It is generally wise to encourage a gradual build up for those who have been sedentary for a long time . Encourage patients with cardiac disease to build up their exercise level gradually, starting with walking . This might include weight lifting and 'burst' anaerobic sports . All patients with diabetes should be encouraged to wear comfortable flexible-soled shoes with good arch support . Exercising barefoot should be discouraged, particularly for those with neuropathy . This effect can occur immediately, but may last for 24 hours after the exercise bout . Strategies for avoiding hypoglycemia in exercise are summarized in Table 8.2 . ","Diet for healthy weight and optimized glucose control is one of the cornerstones of diabetes self-care. Increased physical activity and reduced sedentariness are fundamental to physical health and healthy weight in diabetes control. Suitable management plans for people with diabetes will include addressing nutrition and physical activity, using the skill sets of allied health professionals including dietitians and exercise physiologists, where available. If these specialists are not available or easily accessible, others involved in patient care, including general practitioners, diabetes educators and endocrinologists are ideally placed to provide lifestyle advice to people with diabetes."
9781912776153,chp11,"An arrhythmia forms a significant component of a number of unusual syndromes . Ion channelopathies . Normal mechanisms that control the movement of ions through channels (sodium, potassium and calcium) are responsible for effective myocyte function . Genetic mutations produce abnormalities in these channels, which affect the behavior of ions and thus produce an electrical disturbance in the myocytes . These arrhythmias are very often episodic . Patients can have long periods between arrhythmic events . Long QT syndromes . The QT interval shortens as the heart rate increases and lengthens with bradycardias . In the long QT syndrome (LQTS), both potassium and sodium channels are affected, resulting in prolonged repolarization . Syncope and sudden death may result from torsades de pointes . This VT with an undulating axis may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF), leading to death . The prevalence of LQTS in the general population is approximately 1:4000 people, with the onset of symptoms typically occurring within the first two decades of life . Many patients are initially labeled as having epilepsy . These forms have distinct clinical outcomes, ECG appearances (Figure 11.1) and triggers . Treatment modalities include . beta-blockade . implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) . cardiac sympathectomy . mexiletine (in LQT3) . Beta-blockade abolishes symptoms in 80% of cases, although it is less effective in LQT3 . Pacing at a relatively high rate (80-100 beats per minute [bpm]) keeps the QT interval short . Cardiac sympathectomy was used in early cases but has been largely superseded by more effective treatments . Drugs that prolong the QT interval are shown in Table 11.1 . It should be remembered that by their very action some antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the QT interval . This does not mean the drug should be stopped . Antiarrhythmic agents capable of prolonging the QT interval should not be used together . Large biochemical variations, particularly hypo- or hyperkalemia or hypocalcemia, should be avoided . Potassium levels should be checked regularly in patients on diuretic therapy and in those with intercurrent illness such as severe diarrhea . Short QT syndrome . Brugada syndrome was first reported by the Brugada brothers in 1992 . The diagnostic ECG abnormality is shown in Figure 11.2 . Brugada syndrome is known as Lai Tai in Thailand . This brings out or exaggerates the ECG changes, confirming the diagnosis . Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy . The hypothesis is that, in these regions, mechanical stress causes cell death (and the process may be accelerated by vigorous endurance exercise) . Cell death is followed by fibrofatty replacement of myocardial tissue in three regions of the right ventricle where the wall stresses are greatest . This produces areas of slow conduction as islands of surviving myocardium are separated by scar tissue, which in turn favors re-entry and the development of VT . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a spectrum of disorders that affects myocardial structure, including asymmetric septal hypertrophy and idiopathic subaortic stenosis . recurrent syncope . non-sustained VT on ambulatory ECG monitoring . little (< 10 mmHg) or no blood pressure response with exercise . interventricular septal thickness > 3 cm . family history of sudden death . Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia . Beta receptor blockade either by a maximal dose of beta-blockers or sympathetic denervation is crucial but may not be fully protective, and additional agents such as flecainide may be useful . Genetics and sudden death . However, genetic screening can be very helpful in conditions where the genetic basis is clear and testing is robust . Screening and counseling of family members should be carried out at specialized centers, with clear communication and referral systems in place between diagnostic testers, community healthcare providers, coroner services and affected families . ","An arrhythmic cause should be considered in younger patients presenting with 'epilepsy' - a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is mandatory. ECG changes may be intermittent; a normal baseline ECG may not exclude these conditions. Several forms of congenital long QT syndrome have been described, the most well-characterized of which - LQT1, LQT2 and LQT3 - each have distinct clinical outcomes, ECG appearances and triggers. Brugada syndrome is characterized by sudden death due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation; ECG changes may be intermittent, but an abnormality resembling incomplete or complete right bundle branch block pattern with persistent ST elevation in the precordial chest leads (V1-V3) is diagnostic. Most cases of acquired long QT syndrome are drug-related. Patients with known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy require cardiological assessment. In many cases, screening of family members is mandatory and, if available, referral to a specialized genetics clinic should be made."
9781908541468,ch_9,"Glomerular or tubular involvement may be a major feature of systemic autoimmune diseases, and may result from the deposition of abnormal proteins in dysproteinemias . Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that is most common in young women and often affects the joints, skin, nervous system and kidneys . Approximately 50% of patients with SLE will eventually develop kidney disease . This may affect the glomeruli directly, small blood vessels within the kidney or the interstitium . class III - focal lupus nephritis . class IV-G - global lupus nephritis . Clinical features . Treatment depends on the severity of the kidney lesion . Primary systemic vasculitis . In some patients, vasculitis appears to be restricted to the kidney . Clinical features . Patients generally present with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, although in some patients there may be repeated episodes of less severe renal disease, leading to glomerular scarring together with active lesions . Most patients respond well to treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide . Patients with severe kidney failure or other life-threatening features of disease are generally treated with additional intravenous methylprednisolone and/or plasma exchange . There is evidence that plasma exchange may be more effective than methylprednisolone in salvaging kidney function in patients with advanced kidney failure . With aggressive treatment, most patients, even those on dialysis, will recover kidney function . Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a form of thrombotic microangiopathy, with a tendency to affect the kidney . Kidney histology reveals widespread intraglomerular thrombi, together with an occlusive vasculopathy . Kidney involvement is often accompanied by hematologic and neurological manifestations . There is some clinical overlap with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), though different disease mechanisms are involved . Most affected children will recover spontaneously, though some are left with renal impairment . The role of specific treatment in this so-called D+ HUS is unclear . Systemic sclerosis . Systemic sclerosis may affect the kidney by causing an obstructive vasculopathy of small renal arteries - so-called 'scleroderma kidney' . Clinical features . Systemic sclerosis of the kidney presents with subacute or acute renal impairment . Kidney failure may be compounded by vasospasm in addition to the structural lesions . Although systemic features of scleroderma are generally present (exempli gratia thickening of the skin, telangiectasia, esophageal dysfunction), kidney involvement may occasionally be the presenting feature . Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improves the renal outcome . Sarcoidosis is a disease of unknown etiology, characterized by granulomatous inflammation of a number of organs, including the lungs and kidneys . The typical kidney lesion is a granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis, which can lead to functional impairment . This will generally respond to treatment with corticosteroids . Sarcoidosis may also lead to hypercalcemia, which can itself cause kidney dysfunction . Treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in type I cryoglobulinemia generally involves plasma exchange to reduce paraprotein levels, together with appropriate chemotherapy . Clinical features commonly include a purpuric rash, arthralgia and peripheral neuropathy . Type III cryoglobulins are generally related to an underlying autoimmune disease or chronic infection . They rarely cause severe renal disease . Treatment involves management of the underlying disorder . Multiple myeloma may affect the kidney in many different ways (Table 7.2) . The commonest forms affecting the kidney are AL amyloid, in which Ig light chains are involved, and AA amyloid, in which amyloid A protein produced by chronic inflammation is involved . Amyloid deposition in the kidney commonly results in nephrotic syndrome, usually associated with progressive renal impairment . The natural history is generally of progression . Atherosclerosis may lead to kidney dysfunction by occlusion of the arterial lumen, though this requires a greater than 70% stenosis . ","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly causes kidney disease, which can be severe and requires immunosuppression. Vasculitis is common in the elderly and can be successfully treated if diagnosed early. Long-term treatment is usually needed for both vasculitis and SLE with kidney involvement. Atheromatous renal vascular disease is very common and reflects widespread arterial pathology."
9781910797662,ch09,"The mortality and morbidity of bladder cancer could be reduced in several ways . improving prevention . earlier diagnosis . identification of biomarkers that allow better risk stratification and selection of treatment . development of new therapies and rational combinations . better involvement of palliative and supportive care . Improving prevention . Smoking remains by far the most important contributor to the burden of bladder cancer around the world (see page 9) . In fact, the link between smoking and bladder cancer is stronger than the link with lung cancer but is less well understood by the general population . Smoking is also the factor most amenable to modification through changes to individual behavior and public health measures . This requires changes to societal norms to make smoking an unacceptable behavior . Legislation to ban smoking in public places and in the presence of children is being implemented in many countries . These measures will address numerous other health issues and are an extremely logical use of public healthcare expenditure . Occupational exposure to carcinogens is now uncommon . Schistosomiasis remains a significant factor in bladder carcinogenesis in certain regions, although rates have fallen significantly over the last 25 years as measures to control schistosomiasis have been implemented . Earlier diagnosis . For example, a survey of more than 9600 people in five European countries found that 62% did not know the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer . One example is the 'blood in your pee' public awareness advertising in the UK (part of a larger 'Be clear on cancer' campaign by the National Health Service) and in Australia . It is also important that clinicians understand the importance of following up any incidence of hematuria (see page 27) . Innovative models such as 'one stop' clinics for evaluation of hematuria and performance of cystoscopy may improve outcomes (see page 31) . Tests for tumor markers that may reduce the use of cystoscopy are being explored (see page 33-35) . Hayne and colleagues have summarized the current status of several relevant trials with BCG . Treatment is also likely to be stratified according to molecular and genomic profiling of the tumor rather than conventional light microscopic appearance . This has been the main focus of work to date, and considerable progress has been made across all stages of bladder cancer . Two surgical trials testing the potential benefit of extended pelvic and iliac lymphadenectomy at the time of radical cystectomy will define the optimal anatomic limits of this surgery . Radiation therapy can be administered more safely at higher doses and with fewer side effects . Cytotoxic chemotherapy can now be safely delivered to many patients and previous definitions of cisplatin-ineligibility have been relaxed . Future advances in this area will be based on . use of active therapies at earlier stages in the treatment pathways . better access to therapies, particularly in low- or middle-income countries . Identification of biomarkers that allow better risk stratification and treatment selection . Improvements in the specificity and sensitivity of assays are required before these approaches are used in routine practice . Future developments are likely to involve refinements based on rational assessment of the tumor biology based on genomic, proteomic or immunologic profiling . Development of new therapies and rational combinations . The collection of data and samples for future research is also important . Enormous amounts of data are collected as part of routine clinical care but are not available for research or data linkage . For example, clinical samples used for diagnostic purposes are not made available for research . Our patients expect that this sort of work is being done and are often surprised to find it is not . One simple approach would be an opt-in process whereby patients consent to clinical information collected in the context of routine care, and tissue samples surplus to diagnostic requirements, being made available for future research . Better involvement of palliative and supportive care . Most of the progress in bladder cancer management in the last 20 years has been in supportive care . There is a risk that quality of life is sacrificed by favoring treatments that have good efficacy but might be toxic . Whilst this is understandable, our patients often tell us that quality of life is more important than extending survival . It is heartening to see this growing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes . Future developments in this area are likely to include . incorporation of complementary therapies that have been shown to be beneficial in other cancers, such as exercise programs . ","Public health preventative measures are likely to have the greatest influence on bladder cancer outcomes globally. Earlier diagnosis will shift the pattern of disease towards more favorable stage and grade cancers. Outcomes in advanced disease are likely to improve through the uptake of new therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as better application of existing evidence and treatments. Improved biological characterization of tumors may point towards more appropriate and patient-specific treatments, including those aimed at specific molecular targets. Multidisciplinary management and extended supportive and palliative care measures will increasingly be adopted and improve cancer outcomes and quality of life."

","Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately. Fear over the toxicity of levodopa has resulted in levodopa phobia in some patients; however, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. Dopamine agonists are useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa therapy; some, such as rotigotine, may offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation in practice and specifically offer night-time and early morning benefit. Treatment decisions should be based on the degree of disability, occupational needs, age, patient/clinician preference and adherence issues; neuroprotection remains a theoretical argument, while dyskinesias and wearing off are an important consideration in younger patients. Trial data indicate that treatment of Parkinson's disease could be initiated with levodopa, oral dopamine agonists or a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor. The PD MED study seems to suggest that initial therapy with levodopa offers a small but persistent benefit compared with the alternatives, and initial MAOB inhibitor treatment is at least as effective as a dopamine agonist. The findings of the PDLIFE study suggest that early initiation of treatment may be beneficial in terms of health-related quality of life. Impuse control disorders have emerged as a major complication of mostly dopamine agonist treatment, and monitoring is a must. The treatment of non-motor symptoms is important at all stages of Parkinson's disease. The results of the PANDA study may help people with Parkinson's-associated pain."
9781908541727,ch03,"The most common causes of blurred vision are refractive error (in the young) and cataract (in the elderly) . Causes of acute visual loss . Retinal detachment . The retina can peel off the back wall of the eye, usually after traction from the vitreous jelly tears a hole in the retina (Figure 3.1) . Fluid may then enter through this hole and cause the retina to detach . Short-sighted patients have a greater risk of retinal detachment . Patients with retinal detachment complain of one or more of . Patients complain of sudden or subacute blurring of vision or visual field loss in one eye . Examination shows . Patients complain of floaters and blurred vision . Examination shows normal or reduced acuity, but usually no RAPD unless retinal detachment is also present . There are many possible causes of acute optic neuropathy . Rapid unilateral loss of vision occurs, with pain that worsens when the eye moves . The optic disc may appear normal or swollen on ophthalmoscopy (Figure 3.5) . Vision loss soon after eye surgery . If the patient develops blurred vision with a 'white' eye soon after eye surgery, they could have retinal detachment, or a swelling of the macula called cystoid macular edema . Urgent referral is needed if patients develop problems following surgery . Causes of gradual visual loss . It is rare for patients to complain of blurred vision due to uncorrected refractive error, as the first thing patients with blurred vision usually do is have their glasses checked . presbyopia (the loss of the eye's ability to focus on close objects with age) . Middle-aged patients whose distance vision is fine, but whose reading vision is deteriorating, may be experiencing presbyopia . Cataract is a clouding of the eye's normally clear lens (Figure 3.6) . Cataract usually occurs in the elderly, or in younger patients with diabetes, intraocular inflammation or eye trauma . Patients complain of gradually progressive blurring of vision, which may be asymmetric, and sometimes glare in bright lights . Chronic glaucoma causes slow, painless loss of vision, which is usually not noticed by the patient because peripheral vision is lost first . Chronic glaucoma is common, and risk increases with age . The examination should include an eye pressure test, optic disc examination and automated visual fields . The eyes of a patient with chronic glaucoma appear entirely normal on examination, apart from raised intraocular pressure (in most but not all patients) and characteristic 'cupping' of one or both optic discs (Figure 3.7) . All of your practice's diabetic patients should be enrolled for regular (usually annual) diabetic retinopathy screening . Patients complain of increasing difficulty reading and blurred central vision with preserved peripheral vision . Superimposed on this gradual decline of vision, a minority of patients also experience a sudden loss of central vision with distortion due to the development of 'wet' AMD . Tumors in the orbit or pituitary region often compress one or both optic nerves or the optic chiasm, and usually present with gradual visual field loss and/or loss of VA in one or both eyes . Although rare, chronic macular edema and retinal detachment can also occur, as can other eye disease completely unrelated to the cataract surgery . Causes of transient visual loss . Transient visual loss that is not the prodrome of known migraine is always serious and requires urgent ophthalmic referral . Dangerous causes of non-migrainous transient visual loss include carotid stenosis, heart valve disease, transient ischemic attack and papilledema due to a brain tumor . Eye examination findings after the attack are usually entirely normal . Transient visual loss in both eyes simultaneously is most commonly caused by the binocular 'scintillating scotoma' that occurs before the onset of headache in many patients with migraine . This scotoma may sometimes occur in known migraine patients without headache (acephalgic migraine) . Migraine rarely develops over the age of 50 without the patient having had at least one previous attack in earlier life . Papilledema (bilateral optic disc swelling due to raised intracranial pressure) can also cause fading out of vision in one or both eyes, usually for seconds at a time . ","Most patients with blurred vision have benign, slowly progressive conditions and can be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. However, blurred vision may also be the first symptom of potentially sight- or life-threatening disease, and patients suspected of having a serious cause of blurred vision must be referred urgently. All people over 40 should be encouraged to have regular eye checks by their optometrist to look for early signs of glaucoma and other eye disease. Chronic glaucoma is usually asymptomatic until it is very advanced. Please check that all your practice's diabetic patients are enrolled for regular eye screening to detect diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy is best treated at an asymptomatic stage to prevent visual loss. Always consider temporal arteritis if a patient over 50 complains of sudden loss of vision or transient blurring of vision."
9783318068207,hh-8,"In the era of personalized medicine, tissue samples (histological or cytological specimens) acquire a central role not only for morphological evaluation but also for molecular analyses . FFPE histological samples represent the gold standard starting material from which to extract nucleic acids for molecular analysis . FFPE specimens contain a high quantity of material for both morphological evaluation and ancillary techniques and do not require additional molecular validation, unlike cytological samples . A prolonged fixation time in formalin should be avoided, as this can induce C>T artifacts . Such a change can mimic a mutation and may lead to a false-positive result . Other factors that may influence the integrity of nucleic acids include . cold ischemia time (the time between biospecimen removal from the body and its preservation) . duration of storage of the paraffin block . Data from the literature suggest some good-practice recommendations (Table 6.1) . Direct smears are suitable for rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) when fine needle aspiration (FNA) is performed . This procedure supports the correct management of aspirated material for morphomolecular analysis . In addition, the possibility of targeting a neoplastic lesion with the fine needle allows cancer cell enrichment and avoids contamination with non-neoplastic elements . The major limitation of cytological samples is the necessity for careful validation of techniques before they are implemented in clinical practice . Moreover, despite the high-quality sampling of nucleic acids, these preparations have low quantities of material available for analysis and there is a high risk that diagnostic material will be lost . Cell blocks are cytological preparations that resemble histological samples . The aspirated material is processed in FFPE format . Consequently, cell blocks have advantages and disadvantages similar to those of histological samples . For this reason, the communication should be accurate and avoid any misinterpretation by molecular pathologists or clinicians, particularly oncologists or other physicians who request the molecular analysis . All reports should show the patient's unique identifiers (name, surname, date of birth and identification number) . ward or service . sample type . name of the clinician who requested the molecular analysis . (protein reference sequence) and c . (coding DNA reference sequence) annotations (for example, KRAS p . It is important to indicate, where possible, the variant allelic frequency and coverage of detected alterations . The report should contain a clinical interpretation of the detected variants to suggest treatment options, with literature citations where possible . Building knowledge . The increasing knowledge about genomic alterations involved in cancer development and the technological improvements represent a serious challenge for physicians making decisions about cancer treatment . To overcome these limitations, it is very important that challenging cases are brought to, and discussed by, MTBs . There are 6-40 members at each meeting . Although there are no guideline recommendations, the MTB should meet at least weekly to discuss cases, especially when particular issues emerge . In the absence of guidelines, van der Velden et al . propose recommendations to optimize and facilitate the MTB function . First, there should be global harmonization in cancer sequencing practices and procedures . Finally, MTBs should set out how they will handle unsolicited findings, in particular regarding germline variants . Costs/reimbursement . Costs and reimbursements are crucially important for molecular pathology laboratories offering predictive assays . Owing to a high workload and the necessity of orthogonal technologies (validation process and confirmation of mutational results), laboratories may implement two or more different platforms . Malapelle et al . in a validation study, demonstrated that the costs of NGS were affordable compared with Sanger sequencing (the gold standard) . In another study, Malapelle et al . In addition, the protocol was optimized to run 16 patient samples in a single 316 chip . These modifications reduced the cost to â‚¬98 per sample, similar to the cost of a traditional RT-PCR test . If there is a well-resourced reimbursement-based system, insurance coverage can guarantee the refund of the cost of wide tumor sequencing . In this setting, NGS is fully adopted as a 'one-stop-shop' for all biomarkers . If there is universal healthcare, resources are limited . In this setting, it may be helpful to centralize NGS to make it viable . ",Different sample types (histological or cytological) have distinct advantages and disadvantages; these are a key issue in molecular analysis. Standardization in molecular reporting is very important. Discussing a patient's results and management at an MTB meeting may help to overcome challenging issues. Laboratories should pay careful attention to costs and reimbursement systems for molecular analysis.
9781908541024,ch_8,"Gangliogliomas consist of mature, well-differentiated but neoplastic ganglion cells within a normal neuropil . Despite these pathological differences, gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas have similar clinical and radiographic features . They have been reported at every site of the neuraxis, but most frequently in the temporal lobes . All types of seizures may occur, including simple and complex partial seizures, and generalized seizures . The CT and MRI features of gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas are striking . On CT scans, they appear as well-demarcated, cystic and partially calcified isodense masses that often enhance with contrast administration . If it is possible only to achieve incomplete resection, most authors recommend close observation with regular neuroimaging . There is no established role for chemotherapy, but agents used against gliomas are occasionally used to treat recurrent disease . Central neurocytoma . Central neurocytoma was first described as a distinct entity in 1982 . Central neurocytomas constitute approximately 0.25% of all primary brain tumors . Rarely, they arise within the third ventricle or intraparenchymally . Symptoms are typically due to hydrocephalus, and include headaches, nausea and vomiting, and diplopia . The radiographic appearance of central neurocytomas is characteristic (Figure 7.3) . Characteristically, the enhancing border of the tumor is sharply demarcated from the surrounding ventricles . Complete surgical resection is required for central neurocytomas . No subsequent treatment is indicated immediately, but close clinical and radiographic monitoring is mandatory . If there is recurrence, reoperation is indicated and radiotherapy should be considered, particularly if the recurrence was rapid . Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum . Dysplastic gangliocytoma is a rare disorder combining neoplastic and malformative features . Macroscopically, megaloencephaly is a common finding, with the cerebellum demonstrating thickened folia . Microscopic examination of the cerebellum reveals disruption of cortical lamination by dysplastic neurons, and reduction or absence of white matter . The disorder is usually diagnosed in individuals aged 10-40 years . The most common symptoms are those due to hydrocephalus and cerebellar dysfunction . Patients often have other malformations, including polydactyly and multiple hemangiomas . They may also suffer from seizures and mental retardation . An association with Cowden disease or multiple hamartoma syndrome has been reported, but the significance of this is uncertain . MRI can reliably detect dysplastic gangliocytomas . Contrast enhancement is not a typical feature . Radical resection of the mass lesion is the treatment of choice . Although resection is often subtotal, persistence of a residual lesion may not adversely affect outcome . Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor . There can be nodules of neoplastic oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, which can make pathological differentiation from gliomas difficult . These lesions have combined hamartomatous and neoplastic characteristics, and are frequently located in temporal lobes . They have been identified in individuals of various ages, although most patients present in early childhood with epilepsy . There may be a slight male preponderance . Enhancement with contrast administration is uncommon; when present, it can be diffuse or patchy . Surgical resection of the lesion is the only indicated treatment and, in the vast majority of patients, this cures the epileptic seizures . Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma . Desmoplastic infantile gangliogliomas have solid and cystic components . There appears to be a male predominance . Patients typically present with an enlarged head and other features of hydrocephalus, and also seizures . Enhancement with contrast is often seen within the solid elements and, rarely, in the walls of the cystic components . Subsequent management is not clear . There are often few signs and symptoms other than intractable epilepsy . General management guidelines are shown in Figure 7.1, and specific treatment issues are discussed below . ",Neuronal tumors are uncommon brain neoplasms typically diagnosed in children and young adults. The principal management of neuronal tumors is surgical; total or subtotal resection can be associated with long-term tumor control. The behavior of these tumors can be unpredictable and remains poorly understood because of their rarity.
9781910797105,ch05,"Is schizophrenia a degenerative brain disorder, as originally thought by Kraepelin, or is it better viewed as non-progressive? . During the 1990s, much attention was given to the 'neurodevelopmental hypothesis' of schizophrenia . On the basis of the range of observations outlined in Table 5.1, it was suggested that a static lesion, either genetic or environmental in origin during brain development, expressed its effects as a function of the maturational stage of the brain . In schizophrenia, the characteristic symptoms emerge only during the final stages of brain development in adolescence, when normal 'pruning' or elimination of excess synapses takes place . It is now known that schizophrenia results in part from a developmentally regulated disconnection of higher order association areas, through alterations in neuronal migration, synapse formation and myelination . Neurodevelopmental risk factors . Some established risk factors act early in life (Table 5.2) . Obstetric complications generally appear to increase the risk of schizophrenia . During pregnancy, risk factors include rubella and influenza infections in the first or second trimester and antepartum bleeding . Asphyxia and low birth weight, especially with intrauterine growth retardation, are risk factors at birth, as are certain brain insults and infections in childhood . Early developmental delays . Longitudinal follow-up studies of large birth cohorts have shown that the 1-2% of the sample who go on to develop adult schizophrenia show slight delays in motor, speech and intellectual milestones compared with the rest of the cohort . Certain problems, such as developmental receptive language disorders, are particularly linked to later schizophrenia . Secondary schizophrenias . The so-called secondary schizophrenias fit less easily into the neurodevelopmental formulation . The psychotic symptoms in these cases appear to be caused by a primary organic disorder, either a known physical disorder or a clinically unsuspected brain lesion . Table 5.3 lists those medical conditions in which a clear or possible association with schizophrenia-like disorders has been reported . Antineuronal cell surface antibody disorders involving the N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor can present with psychosis, which responds to immunotherapy . These disorders are more common than previously realized, accounting for perhaps 2-3% of first-onset cases . Clinically recommended screening investigations for first-episode schizophrenia are outlined in Table 5.4 . Use of cannabis and amphetamine-like drugs has long been known to be an important trigger of relapse, but had not been thought to directly cause the onset of illness . However, several cohort studies since 2000 have shown that use of cannabis doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia . The risk is further increased if minor psychotic symptoms pre-exist and if cannabis use starts early in adolescence . Research suggests that this effect of cannabis may be mediated by a particular gene . Those with a specific version of the catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene, carried by about a quarter of the general population, appear to be especially prone to psychosis after cannabis use . Delta-9-THC, the active component of cannabis, disrupts learning and recall in schizophrenia . Psychosocial risk factors . There is emerging evidence for the role of non-biological risk factors in schizophrenia, such as the effects of urban upbringing and of ethnicity, as noted in Chapter 3 . ","Early neurodevelopmental, non-genetic risk factors exist for schizophrenia. Like genetic factors, environmental factors are many and varied. Birth complications increase the child's risk of schizophrenia in later life fourfold. Psychosocial risk factors are being re-established as important risk factors. Cannabis use increases the risk of schizophrenia as well as relapse. Evidence for specific gene-environment interactions is beginning to emerge."
9781908541420,ch_5,"Because of the intermittent and non-specific nature of symptoms, patients may accept the effects of their condition and delay seeking treatment . An accurate diagnosis is essential for effective asthma control . The clinical diagnosis of asthma is often based on the presence of symptoms such as . breathlessness - often episodic . The presence of symptoms, however, is not by itself sufficient for a diagnosis of asthma; the history of symptoms and possible provocative factors must also be considered (Table 3.1), and the diagnosis confirmed by objective measures of lung function . Various symptom scoring scales have been developed to monitor the occurrence and severity of symptoms . Asthma symptoms vary during the day, and the respiratory system may appear normal on physical examination . The patient therefore breathes at a higher lung volume to maintain airway patency . The absence of wheezing is not sufficient to preclude a diagnosis of asthma . In an exacerbation, some patients may have such severe obstruction of the airways that wheezing may not be noticeable . Measurements of lung function . Patients with asthma often have poor recognition of their symptoms and poor perception of symptom severity . Measurements of lung function provide an objective assessment of airflow limitation, and its variability and reversibility, and thus are valuable in the diagnosis and management of asthma . The ratio of FEV to FVC provides a useful measure of airway obstruction . In most patients, there is a good correlation between PEF and FEV . They can be used both for the diagnosis of asthma in the clinic (Table 3.3) and to monitor asthma in the home . Daily variability (%) = . Daily variability of more than 20% indicates asthma . Measurement of bronchial responsiveness . A standardized exercise test has also found use, especially in young children with suspected asthma . Measurement of airway inflammation . Asthma can also be classified according to the inflammation found in the airways . It is measured using specific equipment, some of which is portable and therefore may provide a useful point-of-care test . Exhaled NO levels are generally highly sensitive to corticosteroid treatments, but in corticosteroid-naive patients high levels of NO may be used to support a diagnosis of asthma, while low levels render an asthma diagnosis less likely . Allergen skin-prick tests and other tests for atopy . For the diagnosis of asthma, the results should always be interpreted in relation to the patient's history and the relationship between asthma symptoms and allergen exposure, because up to 45% of the population may exhibit atopy but only a proportion of these individuals will have asthma . Patient groups . The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult in certain patient groups, especially smokers and the extremely young or old, who may have difficulty performing lung function tests . Individuals with other lung disease may also provide a mixed pattern on spirometry testing . Asthma in older people . A history of asthma in childhood and variability on spirometry or PEF testing with beta -agonists supports the diagnosis . Occupational asthma is also often misdiagnosed as chronic bronchitis or COPD . Cough-variant asthma . Patients present with cough as the principal symptom; they seldom wheeze . Lung function tests and measurement of bronchial responsiveness with some form of challenge test are particularly important in these patients . The keys to diagnosing asthma are the patient's history together with measurements of lung function through spirometry and airway variability . Demonstration of reversible and variable airflow limitation confirms the diagnosis of asthma and indicates a trial of preventive treatment . Classification of asthma severity . A combination of symptom measurements and lung function tests can be used to classify asthma according to its severity (Figure 3.5) . However, classification of asthma by severity is not necessarily predictive of the amount or types of treatment required to achieve best asthma outcomes . When assessing the severity of illness it is important to remember that patients often have a poor perception of the potential severity of their asthma, largely because they have adapted their lifestyle to accommodate their disease . There is also often a lack of lung function measurements to provide more objective information . It is important to recognize that even mild asthma can be associated with severe, potentially fatal exacerbations . hospitalization for asthma within the previous year . a history of invasive ventilation for asthma . non-adherence to preventive treatments . difficulty accessing treatment . ","Although asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders, it is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The clinical diagnosis of asthma is often based on the presence of symptoms, such as breathlessness (often episodic), wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. A key feature is variation of symptoms over time, especially diurnal variation. Objective measures of lung function are important in order to establish asthma as a diagnosis and to assess response to treatment. Measurement of bronchial responsiveness and allergy status can aid diagnosis as well as identify possible exacerbating factors. Attempts should be made to assess disease control to guide treatment. The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult in certain patient groups, particularly those who smoke and the very young or old."
9781908541680,ch_6,"Food is metabolized and converted to energy, which is used in . thermogenesis - energy used to process and digest the foods that provide energy; normally around 10% . The easiest way to reduce energy intake is to reduce the energy density of the diet . The importance of adherence . Dietary approaches to weight management . Any change in the pattern of eating that reduces energy intake will result in weight loss . From a practical standpoint it is therefore important to determine for any particular patient where energy intake can be reduced and the nutritional quality of the diet improved without causing a significant disruption to lifestyle . In general, most energy-dense foods are high-fat foods (often dry foods), whereas most foods that contain a lot of water (exempli gratia fruits, vegetables, soups) have a low energy density . After oxidation, fat generates 9 kcal/g, while carbohydrate and protein generate 4 kcal/g . For healthy long-term weight loss and weight maintenance, the food selected should have a high nutrient density but low energy density . Standard calorie-restricted diet . High-fat foods are relatively less satiating than iso-energetic portions of high-protein foods or carbohydrate-containing foods with a high fiber content . Many epidemiological studies have shown that a relatively high intake of dietary fat, in particular saturated (animal) fat, corresponds with increased obesity . Reducing intake of saturated fat and refined carbohydrates facilitates weight loss and forms the basis of the most standard dietary approach . Protein and dairy products . misguided consumption of highly processed carbohydrate-rich energy-dense foods that are marketed as 'low fat' . inadequate intake of fiber from fruit and vegetables . They also reduce cardiovascular events in high-risk patients . Low-fat, modified-carbohydrate diets . Accordingly, when recommending a low-fat diet it is important to ensure that the carbohydrate consumed is appropriate, and that highly processed and low-fiber foods are avoided . Patients should understand that many foods promoted as 'low fat' are high in carbohydrate and low in fiber, and are therefore best avoided . Increased intake of protein relative to carbohydrate . increased satiety . increased thermogenesis . In these diets, energy intake is derived from approximately . The metabolic benefits of this dietary approach include lower plasma triglyceride levels and reduced postprandial blood glucose levels . Very-low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet . This type of diet contributes less than 10% kcal per day as fat, is high in carbohydrate and has a moderate protein content . The Ornish diet is based on plant-based foods that are low in fat and high in complex carbohydrates and fiber; less than 10% of the energy intake should be from fat . The Pritikin diet is similarly low in fat (5-10% of energy), cholesterol, protein (10-15%) and highly refined carbohydrates but is high in complex carbohydrates (80%) . Besides weight loss, these diets have the greatest effect in decreasing serum cholesterol concentrations and thus the risk for heart disease . High-fat, low-carbohydrate diet . This type of diet, for example the widely publicized (and studied) Atkins diet, characteristically contains less than 20-30 g of carbohydrate per day, has a high fat content (55-65%) and relatively high protein content . A variant, Protein Power, focuses more on protein than fat and permits limited intake of fruit and vegetables . The Dukan diet is popular in Europe . These diets gained public acceptance because of the rapid weight loss and decreased hunger . Very-low-calorie diets and meal replacements . VLCDs also reduce comorbidities associated with obesity . In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose can often be normalized . This type of diet may also decrease gastroesophageal reflux . Patients with pre-existing hyperuricemia have an increased risk of gout . It is important that added foods are very low in carbohydrate, as consumption of carbohydrate will produce severe hunger, and control will almost certainly be lost . Approaches include . reintroduction of the VLCD when bodyweight increases to a predetermined level . In obese subjects, diets with meal replacements have proven more effective than conventional diets . Meal replacements offer a promising strategy for treating obese patients with type 2 diabetes . Commercial weight loss programs . ","Weight loss requires a negative energy balance, which for most people is achieved more readily by caloric restriction than by increased physical activity. Dietary adherence is more important than the specific dietary pattern; choice of diet should therefore consider the particular patient's characteristics in terms of culture, lifestyle, understanding, sex, age etc. Important factors in promoting dietary adherence include convenience, choice and an ongoing behavioral support program. Healthy diets focus on fruit and vegetables, whole grains and lean unprocessed meat, chicken and seafood. Up to 30% of energy may come from fat but intake of saturated (animal) fat should be very limited. The predominant fats consumed should be of plant origin such as monounsaturated fatty acids (exempli gratia from olive oil) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and omega-3 fatty acids from seafood. Sugared beverages should be avoided; water is the ideal drink for hydration. Changing to a healthy diet has benefits for cardiometabolic health irrespective of weight loss. A reduction in bodyweight through caloric restriction will result in lower daily energy expenditure, and maintenance of weight loss will then depend on physical activity."
9781910797457,chp8,"Historically, therapy had little effect beyond modest palliation . Some of the trials with important results for the treatment of CRPC are summarized in Table 8.1 . Estrogen treatment may benefit some men with CRPC . It appears to have two effects . direct cytotoxic effect on the tumor . Traditionally, treatment has been either further hormonal manipulation, as described above, or treatment within a clinical trial . Once these fail, however, an observational approach is taken until the patient develops demonstrable metastases (M1 CRPC) for which further treatments are available (see below) . Although a number of therapies, such as the endothelin antagonists atrasentan and zibotentan, have been trialed, none has been effective in delaying the progression of M0 CRPC to M1 CRPC . Abiraterone is approved as first-line treatment for metastatic CRPC . Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor, approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC either prior to chemotherapy or after previous docetaxel treatment . Docetaxel, a member of the taxoid family, induces apoptosis through microtubule stabilization; it has been established as first-line therapy for M1 CRPC for many years . These are the most common side effects with docetaxel but in general the chemotherapeutic agent is well tolerated . Radium-223 delivers targeted alpha therapy to bones . It is approved for the treatment of CRPC in men with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease . Second-line therapy . Treatment options when prostate cancer progresses after docetaxel chemotherapy include further chemotherapy, one of the new hormonal modulation agents or targeted alpha therapy . This taxane chemotherapy was developed to overcome the resistance that can develop as a result of docetaxel treatment . In the TROPIC study, men with CRPC that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomized to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone . Side effects were similar to those seen with docetaxel . It also improved the quality of life of men with CRPC . In the AFFIRM trial, oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, improved survival in men with metastatic CRPC after failure of docetaxel chemotherapy (see Table 8.1) . Radium-223 delivers targeted alpha therapy to bones, delaying symptomatic skeletal and skeletal-related events . Therapies that modulate the immune system are showing considerable promise in trials of CRPC . These therapies take time to mediate an effect and are therefore best used in men with minimal or no symptoms . In a phase III trial of men with CRPC not previously treated with docetaxel, treatment with sipuleucel-T resulted in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death compared with placebo, with minimal side effects (see Table 8.1) . Significant tumor responses with ipilimumab were seen in a phase II trial in men with metastatic CRPC . This immunotherapy is currently in phase III trials . It is likely that a single immune therapy may not have sufficient activity against CRPC, and that combinations of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade will be required . Management of bone metastases . Bone pain is one of the most intractable problems associated with CRPC, and conventional analgesics do not always provide relief . However, some men do not get full resolution of pain, or may have painful bone metastases in the setting of CRPC . Focal external-beam radiotherapy is a well-established treatment, providing rapid improvement in pain in up to 80% of men . Treatment can be given as either a single fraction or as multiple fractions over 2-3 weeks . Wide-field radiation may also be useful in patients with intractable diffuse pain . A randomized trial involving 1904 men with CRPC supported denosumab as the optimal medication to reduce bone-related events in men with CRPC (see Table 8.1) . Despite improving therapies, most patients with CRPC eventually die as a result of the cancer, often within 12-24 months . Treatment with high-dose steroids can sometimes provide useful palliation . Treatment algorithm . A suggested algorithm for the treatment of CRPC is presented in Figure 8.7 . ","After an initial response to androgen ablation, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value starts to rise as a result of androgen-insensitive cell clones. As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen. The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy. The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone is now also licensed for use before chemotherapy, and trials of other antiandrogens prior to chemotherapy are under way. When docetaxel chemotherapy has failed, second-line therapies such as cabazitaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone (a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis), enzalutamide (an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor) and radium-223 (targeted alpha therapy) have been shown to improve survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy for CRPC may be best implemented before significant symptoms appear. The monoclonal antibody denosumab and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have been reported to significantly delay bone-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer. External-beam radiotherapy may provide useful control of pain from bone metastases."
9781910797815,chp7,"JAK inhibitors . PERSIST-1 excluded patients who had previously received JAK2 inhibitors whereas such patients were eligible to enter PERSIST-2 . Both trials showed pacritinib to be superior to best available therapy in terms of spleen and symptom responses . The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia) . Momelotinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor . Clinical development was temporarily halted because of concerns about Wernicke's encephalopathy (eight cases among 877 patients across 18 studies) . However, this could be attributed to thiamine depletion linked to the high metabolic rate of cancer patients and malnourishment, and is readily managed . Fedratinib is likely to be useful in both first line (with benefits demonstrated in patients with platelet counts as low as 50 x 10 /L) and second line . Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a recombinant form of interferon (IFN)-alpha-2b that has a longer elimination half-life than other pegylated IFN preparations, and a favorable safety profile . Other therapeutic targets . Many therapies targeting diverse molecular targets are currently being investigated in myelofibrosis (Table 7.1) . PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway . Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors . Several HDAC inhibitors have been evaluated in patients with MPNs . Although there is some evidence of better efficacy with this combination in terms of reduction in spleen volume, and some reversal of marrow fibrosis, patients experienced significant fatigue, anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity . A large study of givinostat in patients with newly diagnosed PV is planned . DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as decitabine and azacitidine may be effective in patients with MPN with signs of leukemic transformation (see Chapter 9) . Hedgehog pathway inhibitors . Hedgehog is a signaling pathway required for cell differentiation . Glasdegib was associated with significant toxicity, including dysguesia (62% of patients), muscle spasms (57%), alopecia (38%), decreased appetite and fatigue (both 33%) . Telomerase inhibitors . Telomerase controls the addition of telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes and is therefore essential for chromosome stability . Expression of telomerase is increased in MPNs,, suggesting that this enzyme may represent a potential therapeutic target . All four patients who had complete responses also showed reductions in bone marrow fibrosis . The most common adverse events were myelotoxicity and transient reductions in liver enzymes . Inhibitors of bone marrow fibrosis . Bone marrow fibrosis in patients with MPNs is believed to be due to cytokine release from clonal cells, which creates an environment that favors maintenance or expansion of the malignant clone . Inhibition of bone marrow fibrosis might therefore represent a therapeutic strategy . A study of PRM-151 in patients refractory to, intolerant of or ineligible for ruxolitinib is in progress . Erythropoiesis inhibitor blockers . MDM2 inhibitors . The MDM2 oncogene induces binding of p53 to ubiquitin, thereby shortening the plasma half-life of p53 and reducing p53-induced apoptosis in tumor cells . Inhibition of MDM2 may therefore restore the pro-apoptotic activity of p53 . Arginase inhibitors . Arginase has an important role in the immunosuppressant processes that allow tumor cells to evade destruction by the immune system . The arginase inhibitors are attracting increasing attention in the management of a number of cancer types . Bcl-2 antagonists . BET inhibitors . These proteins are examples of 'epigenetic readers' and have been implicated in various hematologic malignancies, prompting trials of BET inhibitors . Early studies also suggest that use of a BET inhibitor in combination with a targeted therapy may prevent resistance . However, the BET proteins have distinct transcriptional pathways, and selectivity may be a challenge in clinical development . Combination therapy . However, this approach raises a number of questions regarding the most appropriate clinical trial design, particularly in terms of patient selection and clinical endpoints . ","A variety of new therapies directed against diverse molecular targets are currently being evaluated. The Janus kinase 2 inhibitor pacritinib was superior to best available therapy in patients with myelofibrosis in terms of spleen and symptom responses. Other potential therapeutic targets include signaling pathways, histone deacetylase, telomerase, DNA methyltransferase and blockade of erythropoietin inhibitors. The use of ruxolitinib in combination with new therapies may offer a further potential approach to treatment."
9783318066685,ch4,"Several gene therapy drugs are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to be marketed as medicines (Table 4.1) . Examples of gene therapies with track records of clinical efficacy are described in the following sections and summarized in Table 4.2 . Prior to gene therapy, no treatment was available for certain forms of hereditary blindness . However, the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to transduce retinal cells on subretinal administration has enabled the development of therapies for such diseases . This effort ultimately led to the first gene therapy drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of a genetic disease in late 2017 . One protocol was successfully expanded to pediatric patients . Children receiving the gene therapy experienced vast improvements in their quality of life, such as being able to attend school or participate in sports . Success with LCA2 gene therapy has generated interest in developing gene therapy for other retinal diseases . For instance, successful outcomes of a gene therapy trial for choroideremia have been reported . To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1 . The FDA has approved the systemic AAV gene therapy for SMN1-deficient children up to the age of 2 years . Engraftment of gene-corrected cells was successful in bone marrow and peripheral blood . Stable reconstitution of ARSA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid can be achieved within 6 months after gene therapy . Primary immune deficiencies: severe combined immune deficiencies . Therefore, T cells are absent, B-cell function is impaired and natural killer (NK) cells fail to develop . Because of the strong selective advantage of gene-corrected cells, there is no need for bone marrow conditioning . However, development of leukemia in six of the 20 patients studied emerged as a major setback in these trials . Interestingly, ADA-SCID was the target for the very first gene therapy trial in 1990 . Remarkably, gene therapy essentially resulted in a cure, with gene correction in multiple cell lineages, ADA expression at normal levels and restoration of immune competence . Hence, the gene therapy product for ADA-SCID obtained marketing approval from the EMA . Nonetheless, SIN retroviral or lentiviral vectors may be the basis for future gene therapy drugs for ADA-SCID, adding another layer of safety . Additional insights emerged from the cumulative experience with gene therapy for ADA-SCID . ERT does not appear to reduce the selective advantage of gene-corrected cells and may have synergistic effects with gene transfer . It is possible that, compared with the blood and other organs, ADA delivery to the brain is limited following gene therapy, or that some irreversible damage to the CNS has already occurred prior to gene therapy . Hematologic disorder: hemophilia . Disease severity correlates with residual coagulation activity . In contrast, gene therapy has the potential to be curative, lasting for many years after a single round of gene transfer (> 10 years in canine models) . Two products expressing FIX-Padua have been developed . Current gene therapies for hemophilia are exclusively for adults, and debate is ongoing whether gene transfer should also be offered to pediatric patients . Cancer gene therapy . CAR-T therapy for lymphoma and leukemia . Adoptive lymphocyte therapy using gene-modified autologous T cells is one of the technologies revolutionizing cancer therapy . Early success has been shown with blood cancers . CAR-T cells targeting CD19 are now approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of several types of blood cancer . CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL was approved in 2017 for children and young adults (up to age 25) . Three of four patients experienced severe adverse events related to treatment, and about half developed severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS; see page 50) . Also in 2017, the first CAR-T cell therapy was approved for the treatment of DLBCL . Interestingly, therapy was effective even in the face of histological findings that traditionally indicate poor prognosis . More recent CAR-T cell therapies with potentially reduced toxicities are being evaluated in clinical trials . Other cancer gene therapies . In the case of melanoma, these may be genetically engineered and thus can also be considered a type of gene therapy . ","Gene therapy, using gene-modified cells or in vivo gene transfer, has now been successful for diverse diseases and modes of gene transfer. After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for Leber congenital amaurosis and spinal muscular atrophy are now approved medicines in the USA and rely on in vivo injection to, respectively, the subretinal space and systemic circulation. Multiple gene therapies for hemophilia, based on hepatic AAV gene transfer, have elevated coagulation factor activities in patients to the normal or near normal range. These are now being evaluated in Phase III trials. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies for blood cancers, targeting the CD19 antigen, are in use to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adults."
9781908541680,ch_2,"The initial approach taken is crucial, however, as an individual can be permanently engaged or alienated depending on the opening gambit . The initial conversation . The initial conversation should . inform the patient of his/her bodyweight in relation to health standards . clearly convey that very large health benefits come from small decreases in weight that are realistic to achieve and maintain . explore the patient's willingness to consider a weight-loss program . reveal previous attempts at weight loss . ascertain the level of support the patient has (exempli gratia from family and friends) . establish practical lifestyle changes and short-term goals appropriate to the individual's circumstances . Recognizing obesity as a medical condition will pave the way for a frank, open and respectful dialogue (Table 1.1) . A patient attending a diabetes or cardiovascular clinic can be asked whether they have lost or gained weight recently . These 2 minutes are the most important part of the entire weight-loss program . Assessing level of engagement . It is also important to ascertain the patient's expectations in terms of weight loss and whether these are realistic . Just because a patient is not ready to lose weight does not mean they are not interested in improving their health . A conversation on healthy nutrition, physical activity, stress management or getting enough sleep is appropriate at every available opportunity . History and physical examination . Sufficient time should be allocated to take a detailed history (Table 1.2) . A general visual assessment of a person's fat distribution and body morphology is useful to define a central, peripheral or mixed pattern of fat distribution . The presence of any dysmorphic features should be noted, as these may suggest the presence of an obesity syndrome . Measurement of blood pressure, using an appropriately sized cuff, is important . The condition is common; therefore, there should be a relatively low threshold for obtaining a sleep study . It is not just the presence of fat but also its distribution that is crucial in determining cardiometabolic risk (see below) . Moreover, the presence of a large and regularly exercised muscle mass confers considerable protection from the effects of excess body fat . BMI = Weight (kg) . It is a useful statistical tool for population and epidemiological studies, and is arguably still the most valuable measure of overweight and obesity in children . For individual adults, however, BMI can be misleading, and it is inaccurate as a predictor of disease . Conversely, individuals with skinny legs and arms and a pot belly have a 'normal' BMI despite a high fat mass . These individuals are at high risk of cardiovascular disease, frailty and disability with increasing age . Thus, BMI is not the ideal measure for clinical practice, and is not suitable as a self-assessment tool . Table 1.4 demonstrates how BMI varies with similar percentage body fat from 20.4 for Ethiopians to 29.5 for Polynesians . This also serves to highlight the importance of ethnic-specific criteria for assessment of obesity and associated risk . Waist circumference is directly proportional to the amount of visceral fat and is therefore an accurate marker of cardiometabolic risk . Correct measurement is shown in Figure 1.1 . Definitions of overweight and obesity in terms of waist circumference are given in Table 1.3 . Measurement of blood pressure and evaluation of the blood lipid profile and blood glucose is mandatory in such individuals . An individual who has increased their physical activity and maintained their dietary intake will lose centimeters around the waist even though they may gain weight as muscle mass increases . Monitoring waist circumference will therefore keep them motivated when lack of change in bodyweight might prove demoralizing . Certain ethnic groups, particularly those of South Asian origin, are inherently at higher risk of comorbid disease at smaller waist circumferences . In the elderly, the hip measurement provides some adjustment for lean body mass . Bioimpedance analysis . BIA gives additional information over and above simple biometric measures, by assessing body composition . It involves passing a small electrical current through the body and monitoring the impedance to its flow . Fat increases the resistance, hence the lean:fat ratio can be calculated . This measure can be motivational in patients who become more active and improve their body composition without actually losing weight . Other assessments . Predicting risk . WHR of 0.85 or less is associated with a low risk compared with WHR of 1 or more, irrespective of BMI . ","Whatever the reason for a patient's presentation, the presence of obesity should be acknowledged and tackled. The initial approach is crucial: an individual can be permanently engaged or alienated depending on the opening gambit. The best initial screening method is to look at the patient: an obese abdomen is a simple physical sign to pick up but can be indicative of potentially serious underlying disease. Waist circumference is directly proportional to the amount of visceral fat. It has gained recognition as a more accurate indicator of cardiometabolic risk than body mass index and is being increasingly embraced in routine medical practice. Decreased waist circumference in the absence of weight loss can keep a patient motivated."
