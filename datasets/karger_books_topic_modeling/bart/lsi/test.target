The molecular status of, at least, EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and BRAF must be tested in patients with advanced stage NSCLC to determine suitability for TKI therapy. PD-L1 expression also needs to be tested in patients with advanced NSCLC to guide immunotherapy decisions. Knowledge of mutations affecting KRAS, MET, RET and NTRK may also help select treatment for advanced NSCLC. Individuals with advanced breast cancer should undergo molecular testing to assess, at least, PIK3CA (ER+ mBC), germinal BRCA mutations ( HER2 âˆ’ mBC), HER2 amplification, MSI and NTRK. Knowledge of PD-L1 expression is also required to guide immunotherapy in TNBC. The utility of assessing several other genes ( ESR1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2 ) and the value of assessing TMB are currently being investigated in breast cancer. Chromosomal instability accounts for around 85% of all CRCs, while MSI accounts for around 15%. CIMP, which shows overlap with the MSI pathway, is found in around 17% of CRCs. The minimum testing required to determine whether anti-EGFR therapy may be of benefit in CRC is extended RAS testing of KRAS and NRAS: codons 12 and 13 of exon 2; codons 59 and 61 of exon 3; and codons 117 and 146 of exon 4. Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations - including BRAF, NRAS and KIT - documented in all melanoma subtypes. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations. BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma; however, these responses may be short. The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors has demonstrated improved durable response rates over a single-agent BRAF inhibitor. Mucosal or acral melanomas with activating mutations or amplifications in KIT may be sensitive to c-KIT inhibitors. The majority of GISTs have KIT mutations that result in constitutive activation of the RTK, c-KIT. TKIs have some effectiveness in GISTs and non-GI sarcomas.
The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods. Depression is complex, and understanding and helping requires a sensitive weighing up of the many factors that are relevant to the individuals and families affected. There are a range of treatments that may be effective for depression, and matching management intensity to the level of depression severity - termed 'stepped care' - is a widely adopted framework for care. For milder forms of depression, self-help, relaxation, sleep hygiene, exercise and problem-solving therapy are likely to be effective; for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants or a structured psychological treatment (cognitive-behavior therapy) is indicated; combined antidepressants and psychological therapy may be most appropriate for severe depression. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the first-choice medication but prior treatment history, medical history and drug interactions are key considerations in treatment selection.
The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age, and women are at higher risk than men. Transabdominal ultrasound is the imaging test of choice, with an accuracy of over 95%, for the diagnosis of gallstones in either acute or chronic cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Acalculous cholecystitis may occur in critically ill patients; the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Patients with gallbladder polyps more than 1 cm in size should be considered for cholecystectomy owing to the increased risk of malignancy. Gallbladder cancer is the most common gastrointestinal cancer in Native Americans in the USA and also has a very high incidence in certain Latin American countries, particularly Chile.
Patients should be referred for presurgical evaluation after failure of two or more regimens using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), particularly if they have a resectable lesion. Essential presurgical evaluation includes long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, MRI with a dedicated protocol, and neuropsychological assessment for language and memory functions. Most patients (70-80%) with mesial temporal sclerosis can become seizure free after anterior temporal lobectomy. Vagus nerve stimulation is a therapeutic option for patients with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures, particularly those with non-resectable seizure foci. The ketogenic diet is effective adjunctive therapy for children with drug-resistant epilepsy. The ketogenic diet should only be used under expert medical and nutritional supervision. Up to one-third of patients with epilepsy take herbal or dietary supplements for general maintenance of health or the control of symptoms such as difficulty sleeping or depression. Thus, knowledge of the products taken by the patient may provide the clinician with information on AED side effects or comorbid mood disorders. Clinicians must take a thorough history from patients regarding the use of alternative medicines, and check reliable databases for information on safety as well as possible effects on seizure frequency and serum AED concentrations.
The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors. The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. Some patients with PK deficiency may tolerate a lower level of hemoglobin than those with other anemias due to increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Splenectomy is beneficial in increasing the hemoglobin level and decreasing the need for transfusions in most patients with PK deficiency. Given the potential risks associated with splenectomy, physicians should participate in shared decision making with their patients to determine whether to pursue splenectomy and at what age. The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis in PK deficiency is similar (approximately 10%) to other non-malignant hematologic conditions.
A seizure is a symptom of brain dysfunction. Depending on the pattern of onset, seizures are broadly classified into partial (focal) and generalized types; classification is important for identifying the underlying cause, prognosis and best approach to management. Epileptic syndromes are defined by clinical features, aided by appropriate investigations that include EEG and brain imaging. Benign rolandic epilepsy occurs in otherwise neurologically normal children and generally has an excellent response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Long-term AED treatment for children with simple febrile seizures is not recommended. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is often drug resistant but may be successfully treated by temporal lobectomy. Genetic mutations affecting ion channels have been identified in a range of rare idiopathic epilepsy syndromes.
Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and place a huge burden on healthcare resources. The main etiologic factors in acute exacerbations are bacterial infection, respiratory viruses and air pollution. Treatment includes oxygen, increased use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and short-term oral glucocorticosteroids. Exacerbations can be prevented by inhaled corticosteroids and vaccination against influenza. Most exacerbations of COPD are managed at home, but those with suspected respiratory failure should be admitted to hospital. Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.
People with schizophrenia exhibit gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. People with schizophrenia have decreased volume of subcortical structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus and thalamus. A subgroup of patients may exhibit progressive changes in brain structure over the course of their illness. Men with schizophrenia have been found to have greater volume reductions in the temporal lobes than women. Hallucinations, delusions and positive formal thought disorder are associated with decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus. Diffusion tensor imaging studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal connections among cortical and subcortical structures.
Comprehensive genomic profiles offer a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor. The interpretation of the different variants reported, with attention focused on their clinical significance and usefulness for cancer patients, can support oncologists to make informed cancer treatment decisions. The clinical and pathological significance of several molecular variants, including SNVs, CNVs and indels, remains unknown. Some therapies are indicated for MSI-H cancer, and others are in clinical trials. Careful attention should be paid to the accuracy of the MMR evaluation (IHC, PCR or NGS). WES or wide gene panels may be employed to assess TMB status to guide immunotherapy decisions. RNA-based molecular approaches play a pivotal role in the identification of targetable gene fusions and splice variants.
Having a close relative with schizophrenia increases one's own risk 15-fold. Identical twins show a 45% concordance rate. Individual vulnerability genes exist, which are each of small effect and interact with other genes and with environmental factors. A growing number of susceptibility genes have been identified, some of which also predispose to bipolar disorder. Copy number variants are rare major genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
COPD occurs, though less commonly, in those who do not smoke. Usually (in 80% of patients) there is a significant smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. For those with lesser smoking histories or for younger individuals, consider an alternative diagnosis or a genetic predisposition (exempli gratia alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency). The most common symptom in COPD is breathlessness on exertion. Dyspnea may be discounted by patients until disease is severe, as breathlessness can be avoided by restricting activity. Physical signs often present only at an advanced stage of the disease. Clinical indicators include signs of overinflation, prominent use of accessory muscles of respiration, weight loss, expiratory wheeze, cyanosis, peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure. These are usually apparent only in severe disease. The systemic effects of COPD result in a number of comorbidities that impact on the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The full spectrum of COPD can now be better identified using new classifications of disease that take into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation.
A carefully taken history is the best screening test for a coagulation disorder. If a bleeding tendency is suspected, the platelet function analyzer-100 test, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the prothrombin time (PT) may identify the cause. Thromboelastography may be useful in patients with massive bleeding. The management of surgical bleeding includes meticulous local hemostatic measures, as well as replacement of red cells, fibrinogen and platelets. Consider vitamin K therapy in every postoperative patient with a prolonged prothrombin time.
Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life. The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures. Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures. When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients. Patients with epilepsy may have difficulty in finding affordable life insurance. Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures without unduly limiting activities.
The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are based on abnormalities of peripheral blood counts and alterations in bone marrow morphology. The diagnostic approach to essential thrombocythemia (ET) generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. In contrast to ET, polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include symptomatic splenomegaly, anemia, constitutional symptoms (exempli gratia fatigue, pruritus), thrombosis and bleeding. In addition to the risk of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life. An individual patient's risk of vascular complications and disease progression depends on multiple clinical and molecular risk factors. Since the level of risk will influence treatment decisions, effective risk stratification is essential for effective management of MPNs. Risk stratification models have been developed for all three MPNs.
Better subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare wedge resection and segmentectomy. New M1c staging for multiple metastases in one or several organs and the use of the term M1b for oligometastatic disease has the potential to provide rational selection criteria for clinical treatment trials. Ground glass opacity (GGO) visualized on high-resolution computed tomography should trigger careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy. Some locally advanced lung cancers benefit from multimodality therapy, which can include surgery.
Tumor types that occur in the ampullary and periampullary regions may have a much better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Neuroendocrine tumors should usually be removed surgically. Patients with inherited neuroendocrine tumors require genetic counseling and long-term follow-up for pancreatic and other tumor types. Cystic pancreatic tumors need to be differentiated from pancreatic pseudocysts, but only a minority need resection at the time of diagnosis. Solitary metastases to the pancreas may be worth resecting.
Tumors of the pineal region often present with obstructive hydrocephalus. The wide range of tumor types that can arise in the pineal region makes histological diagnosis mandatory. The only exception is a patient with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that indicate the presence of a malignant germ cell tumor. CSF studies and spinal MRI should be obtained in all patients with a germ cell tumor or pineoblastoma.
A wide range of targeted agencies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently in the late stages of development, including FLT3 inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, giltertinib, sorafenib), hypomethylating agents (guadecitabine, oral azacitidine), the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat, the blc-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the E-selectin inhibitor GM-1271. Immunologic therapies, antibody-drug conjugates and antibody-based approaches are also being explored in AML. The approval of enasidenib based on single-arm Phase I/II data is challenging the dogma that large randomized controlled trials in a general AML population are required. Trials of new targeted agents are likely to be in small, clearly defined patients with subtypes of AML. The Beat AML trial is using early and comprehensive genetic characterization to assign patients to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations, each receiving a tailored treatment. This approach will hopefully speed up the development of promising agents. Key to all approaches to the treatment of AML is the need to achieve disease control, and continued consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation when feasible.
Acne is a hormonally mediated disease. Four main factors are implicated in the etiology of acne:- high sebum production- hyperkeratinization of the intrafollicular duct- colonization by Propionibacterium acnes- inflammation. There are many myths about the factors that influence acne; patients should be made aware of the appropriate facts (see Table 8.1, pages 83-4 ).
Assessment of functional class, based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic heart failure (HF) as it is linked to outcome. Also key to the diagnosis of HF is the assessment of ejection fraction, underlying etiology and precipitating factors, and the role of coronary artery disease. The hemodynamic profile of acute HF varies according to the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold). Atrial arrhythmias contribute to a reduction in functional capacity, while ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF. Investigations in patients with HF include blood tests, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and other imaging techniques. Functional testing is of particular value in patients deemed suitable candidates for devices or transplantation.
The dopamine hypothesis remains the major neurochemical hypothesis of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms are hypothesized to be due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Negative symptoms are hypothesized to be due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway. Altered glutamate activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of negative and positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. Disturbances in the cholinergic and GABAergic systems have been hypothesized to underlie cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.
Many patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas present with systemic symptoms, and extranodal involvement is common. Detailed immunophenotypic analysis is necessary to accurately diagnose PTCL subtypes. PET scanning can be helpful to diagnose extranodal disease. The International Prognostic Index and the PTCL-specific index are useful prognostic tools. Epstein-Barr virus and CD30 are expressed in several subtypes of PTCL.
Cancer pain is a nociceptive mosaic in which pain may arise from inflammation, tumor infiltration of nerves (neuropathic pain) or other tissues (visceral or somatic pain), treatment, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and from other psychological and environmental factors. Treatment of the cancer itself (by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery etc.) is a primary option in cancer pain management; however, such treatment may be the cause of pain (especially neuropathic pain). Opioids are the foundation for management of cancer pain of moderate to severe intensity, but other drugs should also be considered depending on the pain conditions and mechanisms involved (exempli gratia neuropathic, myofascial, arthritic); however, treatment of cancer pain should not rely on drugs alone, since there are many other options that will produce good results. Psychological therapies that promote 'self-help' strategies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and meditation/relaxation, as well as integrative treatments such as massage and acupuncture, are often useful as part of a multimodal treatment approach to support patients with cancer pain and related symptoms. Radiotherapy is effective for pain from bone metastases. Neural blockade can be used for isolated pain-causing lesions.
The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of the surrounding brain tissue and from the effects of increased intracranial pressure due to increasing tumor size and surrounding edema. The most prevalent symptoms of glioblastoma are neurological in nature. Apart from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life (exempli gratia anorexia, weight loss) in patients receiving palliative care for other forms of cancer are less common in patients with glioblastoma. Seizures and cognitive deficits tend to be seen throughout the trajectory of the disease. Headache and dizziness are more common in the early diagnostic phase, and nausea/vomiting, visual deficits and anorexia are more prevalent during treatment. Confusion, dysphagia, dyspnea, aphasia, drowsiness and fatigue are more prevalent at the end of life. The trajectory of the disease varies widely from patient to patient depending on the location of the tumor and other patient- and treatment-related factors. Patients with glioblastoma should be treated on an individual basis according to their symptom burden at different phases of the disease course.
The incidence of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is approximately 2.6 per 100 000. Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is the most common, with an incidence of approximately 1.0 per 100 000, followed by polycythemia vera (PV) (0.8) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (0.5). Recent data from the UK suggest that the incidence of ET and PV is similar in men and women, whereas PMF is twice as common in men. MPNs primarily affect older individuals: the median age at diagnosis is 70-74 years. ET and PV are associated with near-normal life expectancy whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. Risk factors that may increase the risk of MPNs include higher body mass index, smoking and some occupational exposures.
Surgery is one of the cornerstones of treatment for ovarian cancer. The key aims of surgery are tumor removal and accurate staging. Multivisceral surgery is needed to achieve complete tumor resection. Surgery for relapsed disease is associated with significant prolongation of progression-free survival in prospective studies; data for overall survival are not yet mature, but in retrospective series patients who are tumor free after surgery at relapse have significantly longer overall survival than those with residual tumor. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is associated with lower complete debulking rates at relapse, but not with inferior overall survival in tumor-free patients who undergo surgery.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relatively rare cancer. It is due to proliferation of immature myeloid cells, which interfere with the production of normal red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients typically require transfusion support and are at risk for potentially fatal infection. AML is uniformly fatal without treatment. AML is the most common acute leukemia in older adults, with median age at diagnosis of 67-69 years. Long-term survival of patients with AML is poor: about a quarter of patients survive 5 years but only 10% of older patients. Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time. Most cases of AML are idiopathic; however, prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents increases the risk of AML. Inherited risk is uncommon but is likely to be more frequent than is currently understood.
Three classic syndromes of liver dysfunction are associated with late pregnancy: acute fatty liver, hypertension/eclampsia-related dysfunction and HELLP syndrome, but considerable overlap exists between them. Cholestasis of pregnancy is a recurrent disorder which is associated with increased fetal mortality. Pregnancy is surprisingly well tolerated by women with chronic liver disease.
The epidemiology of lymphoma is difficult to study owing to the existence of so many different subtypes of the disease, each with its own epidemiology and associated causative factors. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s but has plateaued in recent years. An understanding of the epidemiology has, in some instances, led to an understanding of causative factors such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Various other subtypes of lymphoma have been linked with infection, particularly immunosuppression-related lymphomas caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas caused by various bacterial infections. Large cohort studies are required to verify many of the potential causative factors.
Attempt to classify acute liver disease as hepatitis (most common), cholestatic (intermediate) or vascular (unusual). Simple blood tests and an ultrasound examination provide most of the information required. Hypoglycemia, coagulopathy and any evidence of confusion indicate a high risk of acute liver failure and the need for specialist care. Coagulopathy in cholestatic disorders responds to parenteral vitamin K.
Gaps remain in our understanding of the epidemiology of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency because many cases are believed to go unreported. About one quarter of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency will have a previously unrecorded mutation in the PKLR gene. Approximately 70% of mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense mutations. Some mutations are seen more frequently in specific regions and populations. Acquired PK deficiency very rarely can occur secondarily to other blood diseases.
Diet for healthy weight and optimized glucose control is one of the cornerstones of diabetes self-care. Increased physical activity and reduced sedentariness are fundamental to physical health and healthy weight in diabetes control. Suitable management plans for people with diabetes will include addressing nutrition and physical activity, using the skill sets of allied health professionals including dietitians and exercise physiologists, where available. If these specialists are not available or easily accessible, others involved in patient care, including general practitioners, diabetes educators and endocrinologists are ideally placed to provide lifestyle advice to people with diabetes.
An arrhythmic cause should be considered in younger patients presenting with 'epilepsy' - a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is mandatory. ECG changes may be intermittent; a normal baseline ECG may not exclude these conditions. Several forms of congenital long QT syndrome have been described, the most well-characterized of which - LQT1, LQT2 and LQT3 - each have distinct clinical outcomes, ECG appearances and triggers. Brugada syndrome is characterized by sudden death due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation; ECG changes may be intermittent, but an abnormality resembling incomplete or complete right bundle branch block pattern with persistent ST elevation in the precordial chest leads (V1-V3) is diagnostic. Most cases of acquired long QT syndrome are drug-related. Patients with known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy require cardiological assessment. In many cases, screening of family members is mandatory and, if available, referral to a specialized genetics clinic should be made.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly causes kidney disease, which can be severe and requires immunosuppression. Vasculitis is common in the elderly and can be successfully treated if diagnosed early. Long-term treatment is usually needed for both vasculitis and SLE with kidney involvement. Atheromatous renal vascular disease is very common and reflects widespread arterial pathology.
Public health preventative measures are likely to have the greatest influence on bladder cancer outcomes globally. Earlier diagnosis will shift the pattern of disease towards more favorable stage and grade cancers. Outcomes in advanced disease are likely to improve through the uptake of new therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as better application of existing evidence and treatments. Improved biological characterization of tumors may point towards more appropriate and patient-specific treatments, including those aimed at specific molecular targets. Multidisciplinary management and extended supportive and palliative care measures will increasingly be adopted and improve cancer outcomes and quality of life.
Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately. Fear over the toxicity of levodopa has resulted in levodopa phobia in some patients; however, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. Dopamine agonists are useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa therapy; some, such as rotigotine, may offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation in practice and specifically offer night-time and early morning benefit. Treatment decisions should be based on the degree of disability, occupational needs, age, patient/clinician preference and adherence issues; neuroprotection remains a theoretical argument, while dyskinesias and wearing off are an important consideration in younger patients. Trial data indicate that treatment of Parkinson's disease could be initiated with levodopa, oral dopamine agonists or a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor. The PD MED study seems to suggest that initial therapy with levodopa offers a small but persistent benefit compared with the alternatives, and initial MAOB inhibitor treatment is at least as effective as a dopamine agonist. The findings of the PDLIFE study suggest that early initiation of treatment may be beneficial in terms of health-related quality of life. Impuse control disorders have emerged as a major complication of mostly dopamine agonist treatment, and monitoring is a must. The treatment of non-motor symptoms is important at all stages of Parkinson's disease. The results of the PANDA study may help people with Parkinson's-associated pain.
Most patients with blurred vision have benign, slowly progressive conditions and can be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. However, blurred vision may also be the first symptom of potentially sight- or life-threatening disease, and patients suspected of having a serious cause of blurred vision must be referred urgently. All people over 40 should be encouraged to have regular eye checks by their optometrist to look for early signs of glaucoma and other eye disease. Chronic glaucoma is usually asymptomatic until it is very advanced. Please check that all your practice's diabetic patients are enrolled for regular eye screening to detect diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy is best treated at an asymptomatic stage to prevent visual loss. Always consider temporal arteritis if a patient over 50 complains of sudden loss of vision or transient blurring of vision.
Different sample types (histological or cytological) have distinct advantages and disadvantages; these are a key issue in molecular analysis. Standardization in molecular reporting is very important. Discussing a patient's results and management at an MTB meeting may help to overcome challenging issues. Laboratories should pay careful attention to costs and reimbursement systems for molecular analysis.
Neuronal tumors are uncommon brain neoplasms typically diagnosed in children and young adults. The principal management of neuronal tumors is surgical; total or subtotal resection can be associated with long-term tumor control. The behavior of these tumors can be unpredictable and remains poorly understood because of their rarity.
Early neurodevelopmental, non-genetic risk factors exist for schizophrenia. Like genetic factors, environmental factors are many and varied. Birth complications increase the child's risk of schizophrenia in later life fourfold. Psychosocial risk factors are being re-established as important risk factors. Cannabis use increases the risk of schizophrenia as well as relapse. Evidence for specific gene-environment interactions is beginning to emerge.
Although asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders, it is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The clinical diagnosis of asthma is often based on the presence of symptoms, such as breathlessness (often episodic), wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. A key feature is variation of symptoms over time, especially diurnal variation. Objective measures of lung function are important in order to establish asthma as a diagnosis and to assess response to treatment. Measurement of bronchial responsiveness and allergy status can aid diagnosis as well as identify possible exacerbating factors. Attempts should be made to assess disease control to guide treatment. The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult in certain patient groups, particularly those who smoke and the very young or old.
Weight loss requires a negative energy balance, which for most people is achieved more readily by caloric restriction than by increased physical activity. Dietary adherence is more important than the specific dietary pattern; choice of diet should therefore consider the particular patient's characteristics in terms of culture, lifestyle, understanding, sex, age etc. Important factors in promoting dietary adherence include convenience, choice and an ongoing behavioral support program. Healthy diets focus on fruit and vegetables, whole grains and lean unprocessed meat, chicken and seafood. Up to 30% of energy may come from fat but intake of saturated (animal) fat should be very limited. The predominant fats consumed should be of plant origin such as monounsaturated fatty acids (exempli gratia from olive oil) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and omega-3 fatty acids from seafood. Sugared beverages should be avoided; water is the ideal drink for hydration. Changing to a healthy diet has benefits for cardiometabolic health irrespective of weight loss. A reduction in bodyweight through caloric restriction will result in lower daily energy expenditure, and maintenance of weight loss will then depend on physical activity.
After an initial response to androgen ablation, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value starts to rise as a result of androgen-insensitive cell clones. As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen. The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy. The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone is now also licensed for use before chemotherapy, and trials of other antiandrogens prior to chemotherapy are under way. When docetaxel chemotherapy has failed, second-line therapies such as cabazitaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone (a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis), enzalutamide (an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor) and radium-223 (targeted alpha therapy) have been shown to improve survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy for CRPC may be best implemented before significant symptoms appear. The monoclonal antibody denosumab and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have been reported to significantly delay bone-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer. External-beam radiotherapy may provide useful control of pain from bone metastases.
A variety of new therapies directed against diverse molecular targets are currently being evaluated. The Janus kinase 2 inhibitor pacritinib was superior to best available therapy in patients with myelofibrosis in terms of spleen and symptom responses. Other potential therapeutic targets include signaling pathways, histone deacetylase, telomerase, DNA methyltransferase and blockade of erythropoietin inhibitors. The use of ruxolitinib in combination with new therapies may offer a further potential approach to treatment.
Gene therapy, using gene-modified cells or in vivo gene transfer, has now been successful for diverse diseases and modes of gene transfer. After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for Leber congenital amaurosis and spinal muscular atrophy are now approved medicines in the USA and rely on in vivo injection to, respectively, the subretinal space and systemic circulation. Multiple gene therapies for hemophilia, based on hepatic AAV gene transfer, have elevated coagulation factor activities in patients to the normal or near normal range. These are now being evaluated in Phase III trials. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies for blood cancers, targeting the CD19 antigen, are in use to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adults.
Whatever the reason for a patient's presentation, the presence of obesity should be acknowledged and tackled. The initial approach is crucial: an individual can be permanently engaged or alienated depending on the opening gambit. The best initial screening method is to look at the patient: an obese abdomen is a simple physical sign to pick up but can be indicative of potentially serious underlying disease. Waist circumference is directly proportional to the amount of visceral fat. It has gained recognition as a more accurate indicator of cardiometabolic risk than body mass index and is being increasingly embraced in routine medical practice. Decreased waist circumference in the absence of weight loss can keep a patient motivated.
