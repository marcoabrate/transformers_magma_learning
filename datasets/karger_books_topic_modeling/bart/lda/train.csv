9781910797853,chp2,"The 'leukemias' are a heterogeneous group of neoplastic disorders of blood cells . This chapter focuses on four main types of leukemia . acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) . Leukemia predominantly arises from acquired genetic abnormalities in the hematopoietic system . Gene mutations may occur at any stage of cell maturation, preventing normal maturation and/or leading to uncontrolled proliferation to the detriment of normal cell production . Exposure to radiation or carcinogens may cause gene mutations, but the most common reason for the development of leukemia is the accumulation of mutations associated with aging . Identifying mutations in leukemia . In addition, one type of mutation that is common in leukemia is a chromosome translocation, resulting in the formation of a novel fusion gene . Implications of identifying mutations . The identification of chromosomal abnormalities in leukemias has resulted in appropriate treatment stratification for patients with these conditions . Figure 2.3 shows the principles behind the technology and the different utility of the varied methods by which mutations can be identified . The first whole genome from a patient to be sequenced was that of a patient with AML; subsequently, thousands of AML genomes have been sequenced . For example, next-generation sequencing has identified mutations in whole new classes of genes . These genes, such as U2AF1 and SRSF2, are frequently mutated in both AML and CLL . Characterization of the mutations found in large cohorts of patients with AML is providing insights into the molecular cooperativity between different mutations, and further studies may suggest how they interact . CLL and CML are both characterized by an increased number of maturing cells . However, in both ALL and AML the leukemia is characterized by highly proliferative immature cells that are blocked from differentiating . A second mutation, often in a growth receptor pathway, provides an uncontrolled proliferative drive to these mutant cells; examples are mutations in FLT3 or RAS . Many of these mutations are now targetable . In B-cell ALL, dynamic changes in the genome at different stages of treatment and relapse have been well characterized . Clonal subpopulations can be defined by the mutations that they share . Leukemic stem cells . Significant numbers of patients with leukemia relapse with the same clone of cells as that identified at diagnosis, suggesting that a subpopulation within the clone has intrinsic treatment resistance . Relapse then occurs when this leukemic stem cell population is able to reconstitute the leukemia . In B-cell ALL, the model for leukemic stem cells differs . There has been controversy over the precise immunophenotype of the leukemic stem cell . Furthermore, there is less evidence of the same hierarchical structure in B-cell ALL as in AML . Classification of leukemias . Acute myeloid leukemia . The prognosis for a patient with AML depends on the subtype of AML . Although the FAB classification has given way to classifications more reliant on recurrent genetic abnormalities, morphological findings remain a cornerstone of AML classification . The WHO classification of AML recognizes six subgroups . AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities (Table 2.2) . AML, not otherwise specified . The ELN criteria further stratify AML subtypes in terms of the level of risk different genetic abnormalities confer (Table 2.3) . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia . The prognosis for a patient with ALL depends on the subtype of ALL . The 2016 WHO classification subdivides ALL into B- and T-cell ALL . B-cell ALL, which is more common than T-cell ALL in both adults and children, is further subtyped according to recurrent genetic abnormalities (Table 2.5) . As with AML, these different genetic abnormalities convey different prognostic characteristics to the leukemia . Problems distinguishing AML from ALL . At times, acute leukemias may not be readily subdivided into ALL or AML . Chronic myeloid leukemia is characterized by increased proliferation of the myeloid cell line without the loss of differentiation . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be subtyped on the basis of its staging classification, which is similar to lymphoma staging . hairy cell leukemia . chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia . ","The four main types of leukemia are acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The acute leukemias are predominantly characterized by the uncontrolled growth of immature poorly differentiated cells that are blocked from further differentiation. The chronic leukemias are characterized by maturing proliferative later-stage cells. The main reason for the development of leukemia is the accumulation of gene mutations over time. Chromosomal translocations are common. The identification of chromosomal abnormalities aids treatment stratification in patients. New-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the discovery of mutations in leukemia. Malignant clonal subpopulations identified at diagnosis have also been identified at relapse. Prognosis depends on the genetic abnormalities involved, as well as other clinical factors."
9781908541086,ch_8,"The primary goals of treatment for anorexia are to . restore patients to a healthy weight associated with . help patients learn, regain and maintain healthy eating patterns . Table 6.1 shows the indications for hospitalization of adolescents with anorexia . Conversely, in other industrialized nations, it is not uncommon for patients to spend several weeks or even months in hospital in the initial treatment phase . Studies report that up to 40% of hospitalized patients with anorexia are readmitted at least once . Inpatient treatment studies of young adults suggest a continued role for hospitalization for severe cases . The Society of Adolescent Medicine's publication of medical treatment guidelines suggests a consistent pattern of acute hospitalization for patients with anorexia (see Table 6.1) . Non-pharmacological treatment . Because of the high cost of inpatient treatment and its disruptive effect on normal adolescent life, various outpatient approaches to individual, family and group therapy have been employed in the treatment of anorexia . family therapy or supportive therapy . Most clinicians base their interventions for adolescent patients on one of three models: individual psychodynamic therapy, family therapy and family-based treatment . However, rigorous efficacy treatment studies of intensive full-time or day treatment programs are few, especially in adolescents . Psychotherapy has been shown to be ineffective during the acute re-feeding stage of treatment, although a therapeutic alliance is helpful in increasing patient motivation . The emphasis on symptom reduction and simultaneous expectation of normalization of functioning characterizes psychodynamic treatment of anorexia . Cognitive-behavior therapy is less firmly established in the treatment of anorexia than of bulimia . There are no studies for the exact phasing of treatment, but the overall goal mirrors that of bulimia treatment (see Chapter 7) . Minimal research exists on the effectiveness of CBT for anorexic patients, largely because of the difficulties associated with conducting research in this patient population . A small controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of CBT as a post-hospitalization treatment for anorexia in adults found reduced relapse rates and improved outcomes . In randomized controlled trials in patients with anorexia, CBT was not found to be superior to other types of treatment such as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, cognitive-analytic therapy, family therapy for 1 year and low-contact routine treatment . However, adherence to treatment was better with CBT, suggesting that this technique may be more acceptable to patients than other psychological treatments . Family therapy . ii), the familial relationships of patients with early-onset anorexia should be examined . Family therapy is best started after a hospitalized patient has gained weight, but before discharge; it should be continued after the patient has left hospital . At present, the most evidence-based approach to anorexia treatment, particularly in adolescents, is family therapy . Published studies have considered family interventions during hospitalization and during outpatient treatments . In addition, taking the family dynamic into consideration in the treatment plan appears to have a specific effect on overall improvement in addition to weight gain . Psychopharmacological treatment . As for the psychotherapies, which are still considered the mainstay of anorexia treatment, the evidence base and, moreover, consensus on the most effective psychopharmacological treatments of anorexia are limited, in contrast to the treatment of bulimia . Although theoretically this type of medication should be useful in patients with anorexia, the results from controlled studies have been disappointing . Some patients report considerable and uncontrollable carbohydrate hunger . However, the research on treatment of anorexia with SSRIs has not been particularly promising . If using this agent, clinicians should monitor the patient's weight closely . Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline and clomipramine should not be used in patients with anorexia . Underweight patients are particularly prone to the side effects of tricyclic antidepressants . Additionally, prescription of tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided for suicidal patients and patients with cardiovascular concerns . Mood-stabilizing medications such as lithium have not been effective in patients with anorexia . Other pharmacological treatments . Other medications have been tried for the treatment of anorexia but have not demonstrated efficacy in published trials . Optimizing treatment . Psychotherapy helps build a treatment alliance, with both the patient and the parents, to maximize compliance with prescribed weight gain . Treatment of anorexia . ","Up to 40% of patients with anorexia are readmitted to the hospital at least once for weight restoration and nutritional rehabilitation; the length of stay becomes longer with each successive hospitalization. Cognitive-behavior therapy and other psychotherapeutic techniques are an integral part of most multimodal treatment programs for anorexia, for both outpatients and inpatients. Patients with anorexia can be treated with antipsychotic medication in dire situations and in crises, as these medications become effective relatively quickly. Appropriate targets are the patient's obsession regarding weight and body shape (which often resemble a delusion), extreme anxiety regarding re-feeding, and psychotic states. Some second-generation atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole have a more favorable side-effect profile than the traditional antipsychotics, including a higher ratio of serotonin-to-dopamine blockade and weight gain. Tricyclic antidepressants are not recommended for the treatment of patients with anorexia because of the potential for arrhythmia at low bodyweight, a risk of lethal overdose and concern surrounding sudden death in young people. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can target anxiety and depression if efficacy is not of immediate concern. They have a more manageable side-effect profile than the atypical antipsychotics, but treatment should be monitored carefully for suicidality, weight gain or loss, emotional activation and agitation. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of SSRIs in preventing relapse in weight-restored individuals."
9781910797907,chp4,"The diagnosis of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency begins with an assessment of a patient's history, clinical signs/symptoms and laboratory markers of chronic hemolytic anemia . However, clinical symptoms can vary greatly between affected individuals . As would be expected, patients with more severe anemia are diagnosed at a younger age, but PK deficiency can also be diagnosed later into adulthood . PK deficiency may be difficult to diagnose for several reasons . Many different mutations in the PKLR gene have been associated with PK deficiency and about one-quarter of patients will have a novel mutation . It is likely that many cases of PK deficiency remain unrecognized . Consequently, the exact prevalence of PK deficiency is largely unknown . Clinical signs and symptoms . The clinical complications of PK deficiency are outlined below and discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 . Exacerbations of anemia are frequently observed in association with acute infections, stress and pregnancy, and commonly require transfusions . Splenomegaly is present in almost all patients with PK deficiency, with a variable degree of enlargement . However, about 14% of these patients will remain transfusion dependent following splenectomy . Gallstones are detected in patients of all ages, with a median age of diagnosis of 15 years . Overall, gallstones are diagnosed in about 50% of patients and occur even after splenectomy as a result of ongoing hemolysis . Iron overload is frequently observed, even in patients who do not receive regular transfusions . Hemoglobin levels in patients with PK deficiency typically range from 6-12 g/dL and increase by about 1.6 g/dL after splenectomy . In PK-deficient patients, splenectomy usually results in a conspicuous rise in the reticulocyte count . The median indirect hyperbilirubinemia in PK deficiency is about 3.5 mg/dL . Ferritin is frequently increased, even in patients who do not receive regular transfusions . About 50% of patients with PK deficiency have values over 1000 ng/mL or are on chelation therapy . Lactate dehydrogenase, which is mainly a marker of intravascular hemolysis, is not usually elevated in PK deficiency . Assessment of enzyme activity . PK enzymatic activity is usually determined in RBC lysates by spectrophotometric assay . However, there is no clear correlation between the severity of the clinical picture and PK activity as determined by the assay . In fact, patients with only mild clinical signs may display severely reduced PK activity and vice versa . False-positive results suggesting PK deficiency may be due to poor sample storage . Other factors that may give rise to false-normal levels of PK activity in PK-deficient patients include incomplete platelet and leukocyte removal during preparation of a sample for testing, compensatory expression of the PK-M2 isoenzyme (see page 14) and recent transfusions . It is recommended that testing of PK activity is delayed until at least 40-60 days after a transfusion . To date, more than 300 mutations in PKLR have been associated with PK deficiency (see page 17) . It requires smaller sample volumes . In fact, there are patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for PKLR mutations who show normal PK activity . At present, most reference centers screen for PK deficiency by measuring PK enzymatic activity and then confirm suspected PK deficiency by DNA sequence analysis of the PKLR gene . In a few centers, screening for PK deficiency is initially performed by NGS panels and then (in the case of an identified novel mutation) confirmed by PK enzymatic activity . The first attempts to correlate the mutations found in the PKLR gene with the clinical phenotype of affected patients were carried out by analyzing the few known homozygous patients and by studying larger series of compound heterozygous cases grouped according to their clinical phenotype . The severe phenotype was commonly associated with disruptive mutations (id est stop codon, frameshift, splicing and large deletions) and with missense mutations directly involving the active site or affecting protein stability . This mutation resulted in a mild phenotype even in association with disruptive mutations, such as frameshift or stop codon mutations . The NM/NM group had a more severe phenotype, with earlier diagnosis, more severe anemia, a higher rate of splenectomy, a greater need for transfusion and higher ferritin levels . Notably, there was no evidence of an association between PK enzyme activity and the genotype . ","Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency should be considered in patients with signs/symptoms and laboratory findings of chronic hemolytic anemia (including those with mild anemia), reticulocytosis, jaundice, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, gallstones and splenomegaly. The diagnosis of PK deficiency is made by measuring PK enzymatic activity in red blood cell lysates by spectrophotometric assay. The diagnosis should be confirmed by the demonstration of known causative PKLR mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous presentations."
9781910797907,chp1,"PK deficiency was first described in 1961 . To understand the impact of PK deficiency, it is necessary to review the overall metabolism in RBCs . Metabolic pathways in normal red blood cells . Instead, RBCs rely on breaking down glucose to pyruvate and lactate to produce energy . Two major metabolic pathways in RBCs use glucose as a substrate (Figure 1.1) . the glycolytic, or 'energy-producing', pathway . Glycolytic pathway . Under normal conditions, approximately 90% of glucose metabolism in RBCs occurs via the glycolytic pathway, with 5-10% metabolized via the HMP shunt . The key products of the glycolytic pathway are . adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for RBCs . This cofactor plays a vital role in protecting RBCs from oxidant injury by assisting in the production of reduced glutathione . In RBCs, the reaction between hemoglobin and oxygen produces oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion (O -) . Despite their metabolic limitations, normal RBCs have a lifespan of 100-120 days in the circulation . Impact of enzyme disorders on red blood cells . The consequences of enzyme disorders for RBCs are quite variable . Some will result in hemolytic disease manifesting solely as anemia, while others will manifest as a multisystem disorder, with hemolysis being just one feature of the disease . The most common enzyme disorder of RBCs in humans is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency . As a consequence, the production of NADPH by RBCs is impaired and their ability to withstand oxidant injury is diminished . Most affected patients remain asymptomatic, unless exposed to an oxidant challenge . Chronic hemolysis affects only a very small minority of people with this disorder . In contrast to G6PD deficiency, hemolytic anemias resulting from disorders of glycolytic enzymes are relatively rare, affecting only a few thousand individuals worldwide . Pyruvate kinase deficiency impairs normal glucose metabolism, resulting in inadequate ATP (energy) production by RBCs . In severely affected RBCs, the reduced levels of ATP lead to cell injury, a loss of membrane plasticity and the formation of rigid RBCs, which are destroyed in the spleen and liver . In some PK-deficient patients with high reticulocyte counts, ATP levels may be normal or even elevated . The most severely affected reticulocytes will be destroyed, either in the spleen or subsequently in the liver . Less severely affected reticulocytes will have a longer survival . Splenectomy can result in robust, sustained reticulocytosis because severely PK-deficient reticulocytes are no longer subjected to the adverse conditions within the spleen . PK deficiency also results in a build-up of 2,3-DPG, an intermediate product of the glycolytic pathway (see Figure 1.1) . Manifestations of glycolytic enzyme disorders . Hemolysis was initially believed to occur only in individuals who were homozygous for an enzyme deficiency . Instead, most individuals with hemolytic anemia due to a deficiency in a glycolytic enzyme are heterozygous for two different enzyme variants . The clinical manifestations of PK deficiency are discussed in Chapter 5 . More generally, the hemolysis resulting from an enzyme deficiency can manifest as chronic anemia of varying severity, reticulocytosis and some degree of indirect hyperbilirubinemia . Hemolysis may be accelerated as a result of non-specific infections . Different tissues contain different PK isozymes . PK-M2 is present in all tissues during fetal development . PK-M1 is present in mature muscle and brain tissue . Mutations of the PKLR gene are associated with PK deficiency (see Chapter 2) . PK deficiency was originally thought to result from decreased production of a structurally normal enzyme . In one severe form of PK deficiency (PK Beppu), the PK-M2 isozyme persists in mature erythrocytes . ","Normal mature red blood cells (RBCs) rely on the breakdown of glucose via the glycolytic pathway to produce energy. The hexose monophosphate shunt protects RBCs from oxidant damage. Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency affects the penultimate step of the glycolytic pathway, impairing the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and reducing the amount of energy produced by RBCs. PK deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most common glycolytic defect associated with hemolysis."
9781908541963,chapter5,"Three liver diseases are categorized as autoimmune in etiology . autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which targets the hepatocyte . AIH and PBC are predominantly autoimmune diseases, but the categorization is less clear-cut with PSC . Some diagnostic confusion can occur because of the existence of 'overlap syndromes' or histological progression from apparent AIH to either PBC or PSC . AIH is a chronic inflammatory liver disease of at least 6 months' duration . Two types of AIH are defined by classic autoantibody profiles . type 2: anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies . These antibodies are associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, with a dominant elevation in the immunoglobulin (Ig) G fraction in untreated disease . Histological verification and staging of the disease is mandatory . Clinical features . These patients may present with liver failure or complications of portal hypertension . The standard treatment for AIH is immunosuppression with corticosteroids and azathioprine . Flares in disease activity occur in patients on stable long-term therapy and after reductions in drug dose . These flares are treated in a similar way to newly diagnosed disease . Liver transplantation is an effective therapy for advanced disease . PBC is a progressive disease with an asymptomatic phase that may last for 15-20 years . However, a liver biopsy may be of value in staging the severity of the disease . Clinical features . Antihistamines are not effective in this situation . The therapies used to treat the pruritus are listed in Table 5.2 . Hypothyroidism develops in up to 20% of patients with PBC, so it is important to screen regularly for this as a cause of the lethargy . The development of jaundice indicates that the disease is entering the final stage, which lasts for 3-5 years . Encephalopathy is less common than in other causes of end-stage chronic liver disease . There is no curative medical therapy for PBC . Liver transplantation is still the only effective treatment for advanced PBC . The indications for transplantation are liver failure, defined by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) as a disease severity score ranging from 4 to 40, typically above 20; severe and intractable pruritus; and hepatocellular carcinoma The results of liver transplantation for PBC are excellent . PSC can affect all elements of the biliary system . Clinical features . There is a strong association between PSC and inflammatory disease involving the large bowel - mainly ulcerative colitis but also Crohn's disease . About 75% of patients with PSC have inflammatory bowel disease and up to 7.5% of patients with ulcerative colitis have PSC . The diagnosis of PSC may be suggested by the detection of elevated cholestatic enzymes, particularly alkaline phosphatase, on routine screening of patients with inflammatory bowel disease . This is less predictable than that of PBC . Fluctuations in disease may . respond to antibiotic therapy . respond to treatment with UDCA . The risk of this malignant transformation is about 6-15% over the course of the disease . Screening for malignant transformation is not effective in detecting early disease, and progression to cholangiocarcinoma is generally regarded as a contraindication to liver transplantation . This ameliorates pruritus, improves the liver biochemistry and histology and may alter the natural history of the disease . Immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies have not proved effective . Liver transplantation is used widely for advanced disease . PSC recurs in 8-15% of cases and is occasionally a cause of significant graft dysfunction . Diagnostic confusion may arise in some patients who manifest features of more than one autoimmune disease . Patients with early PBC may have florid interface hepatitis on liver biopsy, but this should not be confused with AIH . Other patients have features of AIH and a cholangiopathy, and these are considered to have an 'overlap syndrome' or autoimmune cholangiopathy . These patients are managed as if they had both diseases (id est with corticosteroids and UDCA) . ","Autoimmune liver disease can target the hepatocyte or any element of the bile duct system. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is potentially treatable if diagnosed before the development of cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease, with a presymptomatic period of up to 20 years. Liver transplantation is an excellent treatment for end-stage AIH and PBC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and is unpredictable; late disease can be managed effectively with liver transplantation unless complicated by cholangiocarcinoma."
9781910797273,chp9,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) can almost span a lifetime: average time from disease onset to death is 48 years . Women tend to survive longer than men, unless they have the primary progressive subtype, in which case they do less well than men . Disease onset at a younger age is also associated with longer survival . Comorbidities increase the risk of mortality from MS . Use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs; see Chapter 5) may reduce time to secondary progression, and there is soft evidence of a positive effect on all-cause mortality from the long-term (21-year) follow up of patients randomized to interferon beta (IFNbeta)-1b in the pivotal Phase III trial of that therapy . Death is usually caused by a complication rather than as a direct result of a MS exacerbation (Table 9.1) . Aspects of disease progression . The course of MS is highly variable and often unpredictable in the early relapsing phase of the disease . However, secondary progression ensues in up to 75% of patients with relapsing remitting disease and is marked by inexorable decline that is unaffected by current approved treatments . Some medications under review may decrease disease progression, potentially reducing long-term disability and mortality risk . In a proportion of these patients, severe symptomatology affecting all aspects of neurological functioning may develop . A cohesive multidisciplinary team (see Chapter 8) is important to effectively manage this phase of the disease . Common features of advanced MS include . recurrent infections (urinary tract or aspiration pneumonia) . pressure sores . Palliative care . Early intervention from the palliative care team can be highly beneficial to the patient's quality of life . As far as possible, control over the effects of the disease process should remain with the patient . Palliative care is commonly perceived as a type of care only available at the end stages of a disease, usually cancer . Today, the focus is on integration of palliative care with ongoing treatment . Discussion of the results of disease progression and possible outcomes can be valuable . It can facilitate planning for the future, and consideration of complex decisions, when there is enough time for clear evaluation . Aspects of MS that may benefit from the input of the palliative care team are shown in Table 9.2 . Palliative care in people with MS is not typical of palliative care in patients with other conditions in that it can be introduced in patients who are still receiving active treatment . It can be perceived as care of the dying patient, but this is a limiting perspective that prevents the benefits of palliative care reaching a wider group of patients . End-stage MS can be managed in a variety of settings: at home with specialist nursing care, or in a nursing home, hospital or hospice . Pressure sores . People with MS who are no longer mobile are at risk of developing pressure sores . In patients with contractures, inspection of the areas under constant pressure is vital . Aspiration pneumonia can become a problem when swallowing becomes impaired . Help from speech and language therapists and dietitians can minimize this risk . When dysphagia, apathy from depression or cognitive impairment develops, people with MS may not be able to maintain their nutritional intake . This decision is often included in an advance directive (see below) . Bladder problems arising from MS are often exacerbated by limited mobility and coordination, which makes self-catheterization difficult . In later stages, insertion of suprapubic catheters may be the treatment of choice . Before inserting a catheter, the patient should be formally assessed by a continence specialist . In the community, regular assessment by skilled nurses is essential, to maintain function and to minimize infection . Advance directives . These are legal documents that inform the professionals caring for a person with MS what their wishes would be in a variety of situations . As individuals may reach a point where they are no longer deemed to have the capacity to make decisions about their own care, these decisions clearly need to be made in advance . Lasting (UK), enduring (Australia) or durable (USA) power of attorney is an alternative to an advance directive, whereby a person with MS can appoint a person to make decisions regarding their care once they are no longer able to . This can include decisions regarding their finances and well-being, as well as specific healthcare decisions . ","Natural history studies suggest that life expectancy of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is reduced by 6-7 years compared with unaffected individuals, and comorbidities further increase the risk of mortality in people with MS. The average time from disease onset to mortality is 48 years. Early introduction of disease-modifying therapy may positively affect long-term mortality. Palliative care offers patients improved quality of life in the later stages of the disease. Advance planning can help people with MS achieve the control they need in late disease."
9781910797587,chp04,"Trying to define what causes OA is complicated by factors already alluded to, including the lack of a uniform definition for OA and, in particular, the difficulty of detecting early asymptomatic OA . Risk factors . Although there is some overlap between risk factor profiles for OA incidence and OA progression, these profiles are not identical . Generalized or systemic susceptibility factors include . genetic factors . Genetic factors . It has been known for a long time that primary OA has a genetic element; indeed, the heritability of OA has been estimated at between 30% and 65% . Genome-wide association studies . The UK arcOGEN study of over 7400 cases of hip and knee OA was the first GWAS to report replicable, multiple, independent, genetic associations in OA . It demonstrated that, at a molecular genetic level, OA risk is not the same at different joint sites, id est a polymorphism can be associated with hip OA but not knee OA . Interestingly, the same association was not found in OA at other skeletal sites, even where ALDH1A2 was expressed, again highlighting the potential for differences in the OA pathophysiology at different joint sites . Although no association was found between adipokine levels and cartilage damage, a weak but positive association with synovial inflammation was demonstrated . The majority of longitudinal studies of obesity in OA relate to incident (new development of) OA, and the cross-sectional studies to OA presence versus absence . Although fewer studies have focused on progression of OA, the association with BMI appears less clear cut, and may be mediated by malalignment . Older studies have suggested a negative association of osteoporosis with OA, especially at the hip, although many of these studies have been cross-sectional . Studies have suggested a generalized increase in bone mass in women with OA of the hands, adding to theories on the role of subchondral bone in the pathogenesis of OA . However, increased BMD is not translated into a reduced fracture risk, perhaps due to OA-associated locomotor problems . The relationship between BMD and OA progression at the knee has not been fully elucidated . As mentioned above, the prevalence of OA increases in women after the menopause . This has led to many studies (most cross-sectional) examining the relationship between hormonal status and OA, with conflicting results . Lower levels of vitamin D (an essential component of normal bone biology) have been associated with a greater risk of knee OA progression in some studies, but the association remains controversial . The effect of occupations on OA progression is unknown . The knee joint has probably been best studied in this regard, especially in athletes in whom repetitive high-weight loading is associated with increased rates of OA . Although the pathogenesis of OA remains unknown, current concepts may help explain much of the known OA data and risk factors presented above . OA is conceptualized as a failed or decompensated remodeling of the joint after an initial injury . The role of subchondral bone may be important in the initiation of OA . Clinical studies in women with OA of the hands have looked at bone taken from non-weight-bearing sites distant from the involved joints and have demonstrated a generalized increase in bone mass . Ligament abnormalities are commonly associated with OA in MRI studies, and some work in early OA suggests that ligament abnormalities are associated with development of the disease . What causes OA joint pain? . Importantly, the cause of joint pain in OA is not well understood . Possible peripheral sites of pain origin include the . Although MRI is superior to radiographs for visualizing osteophytes, MRI studies have not consistently confirmed the relationship between osteophytes and pain suggested by radiographic studies . Structure-pain studies . The vast majority of these radiographic studies have focused on the knee . In addition, many radiographic studies did not include the patellofemoral joint . MRI features associated with OA knee pain . As mentioned in Chapter 2, MRI has improved our understanding of in-vivo pathology in OA . MRI studies have shown the following abnormalities to be related to knee pain, though it should be noted that even these pathologies have only weak pain associations . The subchondral bone has been thought to be a source of pain in OA for many years . ","The osteoarthritis (OA) phenotype represents a common endpoint of multiple insults that result in failure of the joint. The findings of genome-wide association studies and research into the epigenetics of OA have the potential to identify new etiologic pathways and OA phenotypes, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The risk factors differ for incidence and progression. There are multiple potential peripheral sources of pain in the pathological OA joint, but the role of spinal and central pain pathways has not been well explored."

A plethora of online tools, publications and weight-loss programs are available for the management of obesity at both an individual level in clinical practice and on a larger scale within the community, and evidence of their effectiveness is beginning to emerge . MEND (www . org) is a community multidisciplinary program for overweight and obese children and their families, currently in use in the USA . Children attend every session with their parent or carer to maximize benefit for the whole family . In a randomized controlled trial, 116 obese children were randomly assigned to MEND intervention or waiting list control (6-month delayed intervention) . Mean attendance for the program was 86% . OBEMAN, which stands for Obesity Management, is a commercial step-by-step computer program, designed by one of the authors (G . Wittert), to help health professionals with the management of obese and overweight patients . The program provides . practical and effective lifestyle programs, including nutrition, activity, behavior management and counseling . Following the initial consultation, the patient's history, management plan and progress to date can be reviewed at each visit, and weight and waist circumference updated . Additional support for a particular management approach is then provided or a new action can be chosen . At the end of the consultation the program provides a prompt to schedule the next appointment with the patient to review the outcome and implement the next step . Rather than using a linear approach, the OBEMAN program allows management to start at any point (diet, physical activity, education, etc . depending on the requirements of the patient . Counterweight (www . org) is an evidence-based weight management program for use in primary care . It is currently provided throughout Scotland and in an increasing number of UK primary care trusts . The model is based on weight management advisers: dietitians specializing in obesity management who train and support primary practice staff to incorporate the program into existing healthcare services . Patients can choose between a goal-setting approach, a structured eating plan or a group program, all based on 500-600 kcal daily energy deficit . Patients also receive advice on increasing physical activity, and behavioral strategies are a core component of the model . The program is flexible and can be delivered individually or to families or groups, depending on need and resources . Weight maintenance is encouraged either following weight loss or as the first option with particular groups of patients . As of November 2010, 6715 patients with a mean BMI of 37.3 kg/m were enrolled on the program . Attendance for patients at 3, 6 and 12 months was 55%, 37% and 28%, respectively . Of those who attended at 12 months, 35.2% had maintained a weight loss of more than 5% . Obesity-related cardiovascular disease risk factors improved in the whole cohort . Counterweight Plus was developed as a non-surgical weight management program for individuals with greater weight loss needs, commencing with a total diet replacement of 810 kcal followed by stepped food reintroduction and weight loss maintenance . In total, 62% of patients with an initial BMI of > 40kg/m completed the liquid diet phase and achieved a mean weight loss of 17.4 kg . At 12 months, the mean loss of the 75% of individuals with a follow-up weight was 12.4 kg . A good example is provided by the UK's National Obesity Forum (NOF), based on that of the Rotherham Institute for Obesity - a fully integrated traditional four-tier model for obesity management: www . Prevention initiatives . EPODE is an obesity prevention program that aims to integrate healthier lifestyles into daily life . The integration of nutritional education into the school curriculum, for example, can change the dietary behavior of children and their families . By creating changes in group dynamics, changes in social norms occur, leading to healthier lifestyles . Since 2004, EPODE has been implemented in more than 500 communities in six countries . In light of the encouraging experiences and results of the EPODE methodology and the EPODE European Network (www . epode-european-network . com), the EPODE International Network (www . epode-international-network . com) was created in 2011 to share best practices and benefit from EPODE methodology and experience . Public health advocacy . role modeling healthy behaviors . ","There are successful models for every stage of obesity, including prevention, childhood obesity and the treatment and management of adult obesity. There is robust evidence indicating the effectiveness of the MEND program for children and the Counterweight program for adults. The obesity prevention program EPODE has had proven success with a whole-community approach to the integration of healthier lifestyles into daily life, including the addition of nutritional education to school curriculums. Since water is the appropriate drink for hydration, a tax on all sugar-containing/carbonated drinks is probably the most logical fiscal measure that governments could implement to tackle obesity. Health professionals have an ethical and moral obligation, and the opportunity, to promote public health as well as taking care of individual patients."
9781912776238,ch9,"Three are supportive care growth factors - epoetin alfa, filgrastim and pegfilgrastim - which are almost identical to natural products the body makes . Epoetin alfa . It is used for the treatment of patients with anemia associated with various clinical conditions, including chronic renal failure, and cytotoxic chemotherapy (Table 9.1) . The need for epoetin biosimilars is underlined by forecasts suggesting that the increasing incidence of cancer, chronic kidney disease, and anemia associated with HIV will drive annual growth of 11.5% . Formulation changes, medicines handling and differences in injection device were associated with serious drug safety events . TABLE 9.2 Diagnostic criteria for epoetin-antibody-mediated PRCA . Unexplained loss of drug effect and . Platelets and white blood cells are normal . Two cases of PRCA occurred in a proposed biosimilar epoetin trial - associated with drug aggregation triggered by tungsten fragments from fixing the syringe needle to the single-use glass syringe . Epoetin was suggested to promote cancer growth . The US FDA issued a Public Health Advisory and a clinical alert over the use of epoetins in cancer patients following a higher proportion of deaths in the epoetin arms of trials looking to expand the label into prevention of anemia associated with chemotherapy (which differs from treatment of established anemia) and as a sensitizer for curative radiation therapy . As a result, the label for treating anemia associated with cancer chemotherapy was 'black boxed' in the USA, and the EMA issued a drug alert and mandated a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) . The question of a potential unknown 'off-target' effect of epoetins on cancer growth was raised . A potential unknown mechanism of toxicity creates difficulties for biosimilars as there is, by definition, no analytic test that can be used to demonstrate comparability other than large-scale clinical data . The immunogenicity of biosimilar epoetin was assessed for comparability in analytics and clinical confirmatory studies . For cancer chemotherapy . As a result, biosimilar epoetin alfa Retacrit was approved by 14 votes to 1 and the FDA closed the REMS program for treating patients with anemia related to associated myelosuppressive chemotherapy . Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim . The first recombinant G-CSF filgrastim was approved in 1991, and its value has been evolving ever since . Initial health technology assessments suggested low value because of high drug costs and no evidence for significant gain in overall survival . This explains the inclusion of filgrastim in the WHO Essential Drug List for cancer . In contrast to epoetin alfa, G-CSF was a much more straightforward biosimilar to assess . The US ODAC discussed the significant supporting data for EP2006 (Zarxio, Sandoz) (see Figure 9.2 for examples of data considered) . There had also been five confirmatory post-approval studies, with 1302 participants, of the European-approved version of biosimilar G-CSF (Zarzio), coupled with successful pharmacovigilance of approximately 4.5 million patient-days to June 2013 . The ODAC unanimously approved the filgrastim biosimilar, Zarxio . Unlike a typical two-arm confirmatory clinical study, patients were randomized into four arms . Blood counts and toxicity could be compared between 192 patients split evenly into two groups on cycle 1 . This increases the total events studied, giving additional efficacy and safety data . Pegfilgrastim is filgrastim modified with the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) . The relevant indications for pegfilgrastim are summarized in Table 9.5 . While the detail of dialog between drug developers and regulators is secret, sufficient public discussion was available to suggest that the problems in assessment lay in the analytics of PEG and the variability of pharmacokinetic studies . In April 2017, the US FDA raised questions about the PEG accumulation reported in animal models . These manufacturers also performed confirmatory efficacy and safety studies; Sandoz with three studies involving 682 patients in breast cancer chemotherapy while Mylan performed one confirmatory efficacy and safety study in breast cancer with 194 patients . In the same period, the USA approved Fulphila and Udenyca . ","No biosimilar has been approved for which comparable immunogenicity in regulatory studies has not predicted real-world outcomes in more than 10 years of European experience. For epoetin, comparable composite outcomes were found in more than 13 000 patients treated with reference or biosimilar epoetins and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which reassured the regulator about the safety of biosimilar epoetin for symptomatic chemotherapy-induced anemia. The design of the four-arm Pioneer study allowed data collection for participants who switched from originator to biosimilar filgrastim or vice versa on each round of chemotherapy, in anticipation of regulatory requirements to demonstrate interchangeability."
9781908541062,ch_8,"Patients who are seen in academic referral centers are likely to have more severe disease and usually possess more of the above-mentioned features associated with poor prognosis . Assessment of ongoing RA . The assessment of RA is both objective and subjective . Additionally, satisfaction with medical management may depend more upon the patient's functional capabilities . Assessing function . Functional impairment may be evident at presentation . They are useful tools for assessing current disease status but also carry prognostic significance (see above) . Others, such as the McMaster Toronto Arthritis (MACTAR) Patient Preference Questionnaire, adopt a patient-specific perspective, and attempt to measure personal handicap . Thus, the patient nominates specific roles pertinent to their personal situation and, at each assessment, rates their ability to fulfill those roles . Patients can also be allocated to specific 'functional classes' (Table 7.2), but these are relatively insensitive to short-term change . Generic examples include the Nottingham Health Profile and the SF36, whereas the rheumatoid arthritis QoL (RAQoL) instrument was designed specifically for patients with RA . RA is a complex disease and cannot be assessed using a single measure . Therefore, in accordance with the variable manifestations and outcomes of RA, composite assessment criteria have been devised, although debate continues regarding the 'minimal data set' needed to provide a reliable picture of the individual patient . The ACR response criteria were designed for assessing outcomes in the clinical trials setting . These measure changes from baseline in the number of tender and swollen joints, acute-phase response, a functional measure (exempli gratia HAQ score), visual analog scale for pain, and global assessment of disease by patient and physician, also on a visual analog scale . In contrast, the disease activity score (DAS; Figure 7.3) provides a continuous variable which does not require reference to a baseline . The DAS is a complex measure that was derived by studying a number of disease activity criteria in patients with variable disease activity, and applying assorted statistical measures, including discriminant analysis and multiple regression analysis . Because of its continuous nature, a patient can be assigned a meaningful DAS at any stage of their disease, and inter-patient comparisons can also be made . Increasingly, the DAS is being used in the routine clinic setting . It provides a longitudinal quantitative measure of RA activity by which to judge the effectiveness of current management and the need for adjustment . In the clinical trial setting, improvement targets can be defined as both a reduction in DAS and also a target level of DAS, providing for good, moderate and nil improvements . Alternatives to the DAS include the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and the clinical disease activity index (CDAI) . Fatigue and sleep disturbance, as just two examples, are poorly captured by conventional outcome measures such as DAS28 and yet are some of the most disabling symptoms to patients . The Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) or Multi Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) is a patient-completed composite score that incorporates physical function, pain and patient global assessment that is simple to perform . Many patients can also reliably perform their own joint counts, providing further self-assessment information . Functional impairment in chronic RA is influenced by the amount of joint damage (see Figure 7.1) . Biochemical markers of damage . Some of these assays are starting to provide useful information in the clinical trial setting, when applied to groups of patients receiving different treatments . Currently, however, none has sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be applied routinely in the clinic to provide an index of tissue damage for the individual patient . These criteria are very exacting, however, and are unlikely to be fulfilled by patients with joint damage . DAS remission is defined by a DAS <= 1.6 or DAS28 <= 2.6 but neither include all possible joints - in particular, DAS28 ignores the feet . A DAS28 <= 3.2 defines low disease activity . Alternative criteria are being defined and debated, including the use of synovial imaging . When a patient develops rheumatoid arthritis (RA), they are keen to understand their long-term outlook . RA can still result in severe disability and a dependent existence, but increasingly effective drugs and management strategies have improved the outlook for the majority of patients . It is not possible to provide a completely accurate picture for each patient, but a number of prognostic factors have now been defined . ","Rheumatoid arthritis can be assessed using objective clinical scores such as swollen-joint counts, biochemical and radiological parameters such as acute-phase response and joint X-rays, and subjective measures of pain, function and participation. Most information is captured in composite scores such as the disease activity score (DAS). Quality of life is of overriding importance to the patient, and should always be considered during routine assessments. A number of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are being developed that quantify symptoms such as fatigue and sleep."
9781908541420,ch_6,"To achieve this, preventive measures including the use of medication to prevent symptoms to treat acute attacks is necessary . Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (also called preventers) and relievers . Controllers (preventers) are taken daily over the long term to control persistent asthma (Table 4.2) . They are the mainstay of effective asthma treatment, improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths . Short courses (3-7 days) can be used when starting therapy in patients with uncontrolled asthma or during periods of worsening asthma . Long-term treatment may rarely be necessary in patients with severe persistent asthma; patients who require such medication should be seen by a specialist . However, these drugs are less effective overall than a low dose of inhaled corticosteroid . They can also be used together with an inhaled corticosteroid in moderate and severe asthma, but are less effective than the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an inhaled LABA . Both agents can be used as maintenance therapy for asthma but are less effective than a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids . During long-term treatment, sustained-release theophylline controls symptoms and improves lung function . Clinical trials have revealed that this anti-allergy treatment is effective in treating allergic asthma . Reliever medications . Combination therapy . The addition of a LABA is indicated for all whose asthma fails to be controlled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid . This means patients have only one inhaler for both their controller and reliever therapy . Delivery of inhaled medication . The patient inhales the aerosol through a face mask or mouthpiece . Asthma control . There are two broad aims of asthma control . The first is to reduce or eliminate asthma symptoms or the limitations of activities due to asthma . Key elements in assessing asthma control include the presence of symptoms both by day and night, the requirement for reliever medication and lung function or peak flow measurements . While assessment of symptoms can occur in the process of a clinical consultation, questionnaires have been developed to reliably measure asthma control, such as the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or the Asthma Control Test (ACT) . The second aim of asthma control is prevention of exacerbations . While achieving control of asthma symptoms is likely to lead to prevention of exacerbations in most, for some patients asthma exacerbations are the predominant feature of their asthma . All patients should aim to have well-controlled asthma, and treatment should be stepped up or down, as appropriate, every 1-3 months to achieve and maintain asthma control . Recommended management strategies suggest five treatment steps . Generally, after 3 months of well-controlled asthma a step down to a lower level of treatment should be considered . For these patients, an inhaled as-needed SABA may be appropriate therapy without a regular controller treatment . Such patients can still experience exacerbations and the intensity of treatment for exacerbations should depend on the severity of the exacerbation (see Chapter 5) . Step 2 is usually indicated for initial treatment in those who have moderate symptoms . While the best available evidence supports inhaled corticosteroids for asthma treatment at this level for prevention of exacerbations and symptom control, leukotriene modifiers are an alternative at this treatment step . Patients who still have symptoms of uncontrolled asthma despite using a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, or those with more severe symptoms without treatment, should progress to step 3 . Patients with more severe asthma and persistent symptoms despite step 3 treatment should be treated with escalating doses of inhaled corticosteroid and LABA therapy in addition to a SABA . At this level of treatment, additional controllers such as sustained-release theophylline or leukotriene modifiers can also be used . Such unresponsive asthma symptoms should prompt a consideration of the diagnosis of asthma and the exclusion of other factors that may be worsening asthma . Oral corticosteroids should be used at the lowest dose and for the minimum time required to gain asthma symptom control . The symptom-driven stepwise approach to asthma care described above is similar in children . Written treatment plan . All patients with asthma should have a written plan that describes their current step of asthma treatment and advises on treatment adjustments to accommodate worsening asthma (see Chapter 6) . ","Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks. Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy. Increased use of relievers (short-acting beta -agonists) indicates inadequate disease control. Asthma therapy should be tailored to disease severity; current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment. Any exacerbation should prompt a review of maintenance medications. All patients with asthma should have a written asthma action plan. If recommended treatment fails, adherence and diagnosis should be re-examined before treatment is escalated."
9781912776276,chp4,"The most common psychotic symptoms in PDP are hallucinations, illusions, delusions and delusional misidentification (see page 7) . Although the psychotic symptoms are the same as those that occur in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), they usually occur in patients taking medications for their PD motor symptoms (see pages 24 -), and less frequently in untreated patients . Hallucinations are usually visual, occurring in about 90% of people with PDP . Auditory hallucinations are about half as common . Tactile hallucinations are considerably less common, while olfactory and gustatory hallucinations are much less common . They are most commonly people, often children, sometimes Lilliputian in size, usually strangers but sometimes family members or friends . In general, they ignore the patient . The patient may notice someone or a few people sitting on the sofa, watching TV with him . The images ignore the patient when he talks to them but disappear if he approaches them . Patients may recognize these phenomena as hallucinations and not be bothered by them, especially if they occur only occasionally and for short durations . Patients usually have insight into the fantastic nature of the hallucinations, recognizing them as medication side effects, but may be unsure because the hallucinations seem so real . A patient driving his car was bothered by people in the back seat . Unlike schizophrenic hallucinations, PDP hallucinations generally have limited emotional content . Occasionally, patients may even look forward to the hallucinations; for example, the 'nice baby' who makes no noise, or the deceased spouse who sleeps beside the patient . Some patients may call the police when the hallucinated figures refuse to leave, or seem threatening simply by their presence, not necessarily because they look like they will attack the patient . They are not people making comments about the patient . These are generally not very bothersome, because patients are aware they are illusions and do not act on them . Illusions are rarely disturbing to the patient, other than making them worry about their perception of reality . Delusions are usually serious problems as they tend to be paranoid in nature and cause difficulties both for the patient and the caregivers . Because delusions are generally paranoid, they are often not discussed with family members or the doctor, as the patient and the family are embarrassed by the accusations . The family may be trying to institutionalize the patient . Vivid dreams are the most common problem mistaken for PDP . The dreams may seem so real that patients wake up thinking their dream really occurred . Dream phenomena . Patients with PD may exhibit dream enactment behavior . They often talk in their sleep as well, which can be misperceived by a spouse as talking to a hallucination . While these are, in fact, hallucinations, they are more appropriately considered dream phenomena . Charles Bonnet syndrome . Since visual hallucinations are the most common psychotic symptom, the differential diagnosis may include Charles Bonnet syndrome, a disorder in which patients with severely impaired vision have visual hallucinations . It does not occur in elderly people with normal or near normal vision . Charles Bonnet syndrome may develop suddenly, with an acute visual decline, and patients may see the hallucinations only in the affected visual field . The images are similar to those seen in PDP, being generally quite benign . Sometimes the same image or theme is seen repeatedly, as is typical in PDP, or the patient sees a spectrum of images . There are no delusions associated with this disorder . Auditory 'release' hallucinations associated with hearing loss are less common but do occur . This is often not possible to ascertain . Psychotic symptoms associated with primary psychiatric disorders . Loose associations are not generally seen in PDP . Patients with PDP who have loose associations, as are typical in schizophrenia, are almost always demented or delirious . Patients with PDP commonly experience other psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, irritability, agitation and aggression . Impulse control disorders are particularly prevalent in patients receiving dopamine agonists . These comorbidities may work synergistically with PDP, each making the other worse . Scales for assessing the severity of PDP . Several scales are used in clinical trials to assess the severity of PDP, but there is no single gold standard scale . In contrast to assessing severity, 'no scale adequately screens for psychosis' . However, they are central in psychiatric psychosis scales . Different studies have used different modifications of these scales, and other scales exist . ","Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) typically manifests as visual hallucinations. Auditory, tactile and olfactory hallucinations are less common. Psychotic symptoms may be present as part of a delirium. Behaviors associated with sleep may be difficult to distinguish from psychotic symptoms. Vivid dreams may be perceived as real, and brief episodes of dream continuation on awakening cannot always be distinguished from PDP. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disease or major depression may have psychotic symptoms from these disorders rather than PDP. Comorbid psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety work synergistically with the psychosis, each making the other worse. The Clinical Global Impressions Scale is a simple short tool for assessing PDP in clinical practice; it reflects the actual clinical evaluation."
9781908541796,chapter9,"Hodgkin lymphoma generally affects young people and can be cured in most cases . For many years, the nature of the disease was unclear because of some very unusual features of the malignant cell - the Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cell . Subsequent molecular techniques demonstrated the cells to be derived from a malignant B cell . Hodgkin lymphoma can really therefore be regarded as a B-cell lymphoma . It does deserve its own category of disease, however, as the pathology, clinical course, response to treatment and prognosis are different from all other lymphoma subtypes . Hodgkin lymphoma is subdivided into classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (nLPHL) . However, most cells in a biopsy from Hodgkin lymphoma are not HRS cells but reactive polyclonal cells such as T cells, eosinophils and macrophages . These cells are often surrounded by a rosette of T cells and embedded in a nodule of mainly B cells . Clinical presentation . Classic Hodgkin lymphoma . A particularly characteristic presentation is with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes resulting in cough and breathlessness, particularly on lying flat . Interestingly, alcohol-induced pain at sites of disease is a striking and characteristic feature of classic Hodgkin lymphoma, though somewhat rare . Presentation is nearly always with a single enlarged lymph node and disease is usually at a very early stage . Local treatment measures (such as surgery or radiotherapy) are potentially curative although it has become clear that late relapses can occur . Treatment has greatly improved over the last few decades . Early-stage disease can be considered as stages IA and IIA (with no bulk) . Classic Hodgkin lymphoma . Until relatively recently, early-stage disease was treated with extended-field radiotherapy alone . However, such treatment was associated with a significant relapse rate and serious late toxicities . The other major long-term toxicity was found to be coronary heart disease in patients who had radiotherapy involving the heart . Most centers now treat favorable disease with two to four cycles of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD), followed by radiotherapy to only those areas directly affected by the disease (involved-field or involved-site radiotherapy) . Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma . As patients often present with stage I disease, simple lymph-node excision followed by active surveillance may suffice . If indicated, further treatment may include radiotherapy alone or rituximab (as most cases are CD20+), while combination chemotherapy is reserved for more widespread disease or transformation . Late-stage disease can be considered as stages IIB-IV . Improvements in treatment have led to increased survival (Figure 9.3) . Most centers treat late-stage disease with six to eight cycles of combination chemotherapy, usually ABVD, together with radiotherapy to sites of bulky disease . It is unclear whether this regimen results in better overall survival rates, as patients relapsing after ABVD can often be successfully treated . If recognized early, however, treatment with corticosteroids is often successful . Current research in the treatment of advanced Hodgkin lymphoma is addressing the use of PET scanning to direct therapy . Salvage chemotherapy is often offered to patients who relapse . For patients who remain chemosensitive, the standard treatment is to then harvest stem cells and proceed to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue . The cure rate for these patients is about 50% . The cure rate for early-stage disease is generally excellent and approaches 95% . In late-stage disease the cure rate is 75-80% . although in those with a particularly poor prognosis it is 60-65% . As the prognosis for young patients with Hodgkin lymphoma improves, concern is now shifting to the long-term toxicities associated with treatment . As outlined previously, these include secondary cancers and heart disease . An analysis of survival data from Hodgkin patients over the past few decades shows that, after 15-20 years, patients are more likely to die of these late toxicities than from relapse of their lymphoma . As previously mentioned, the use of interim PET scanning to guide risk-adapted treatment intensity also offers the hope of limiting the more toxic treatments to the patients who will particularly benefit . ","Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively common form of lymphoma that predominantly affects young people and is curable. There are two main types with distinct immunophenotypes and clinical pictures: classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (nLPHL). Diagnosis is by biopsy and identification of Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in cHL, or lymphocytic and histiocytic cells (LandH) in nLPHL. HRS cells are typically CD15+ and CD30+; LandH cells have a characteristic B-cell phenotype. Treatment of early-stage cHL involves two to four courses of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD), often with involved-field radiotherapy. Treatment of late-stage cHL involves six to eight courses of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD). The cure rate is 90-95% for early-stage disease and 75-80% for late-stage disease. Because of the high cure rates, a major aim of future treatment strategies is to reduce the long-term effects of treatment, such as secondary cancers and heart disease."
9781910797853,chp1,"Hematopoiesis is the process by which blood cells develop . It begins with the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the major arteries of a developing embryo, which eventually seed the bone marrow . After birth, a steady 'pool' of HSCs, from which all blood cells arise, is maintained in the bone marrow by the carefully orchestrated regulation of HSC self-renewal and differentiation . Hierarchical relationship of blood cell development . HSCs in the bone marrow subsequently develop into other terminally differentiated cells such as erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes (Figure 1.1) . HSCs give rise to both myeloid and lymphoid lineages of blood cells . The commitment of differentiated cells is irreversible: for example, monocytes cannot form erythrocytes . Self-renewal . The second fundamental attribute of HSCs is the ability to self-renew to provide a continuous source of blood cells throughout the human lifespan . One way in which this is regulated is through the loss of self-renewal properties in differentiated cells such as neutrophils and monocytes . This requires the HSCs to exit dormancy and generate intermediate progenitors (see Figure 1.1), which are able to divide rapidly and replenish these peripheral cells . The precursors of fully differentiated neutrophils and erythrocytes bear intermediate properties between the final cells and the HSCs . They have an increasingly restricted developmental potential as they complete their development . Cells sorted on the basis of these cell surface markers have been transplanted into irradiated mice, and only specific populations of cells have been found to develop from them . Similarly, upstream intermediate progenitors of myeloid and erythroid cells have been identified . More recent work based on single-cell analyses has revealed novel insights into the process of hematopoiesis (Figures 1.2b,c) . Normal blood cells can be sorted into individual cells using flow cytometry and RNA extracted . From this, the expression levels of different genes can be identified using next-generation sequencing . From this information, in combination with traditional transplantation studies, the ultimate fate of these cells can be determined . Regulation of normal blood cell development . The role of cytokine signaling . Cytokines provide a signal to cells to proliferate and differentiate . For example, dormant HSCs can be stimulated by the cytokine interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) to produce more proliferative oligopotent stem cells that can differentiate into other cells such as neutrophils . An ongoing debate on the role of cytokine signaling is whether cytokines merely provide a permissive environment for HSCs to differentiate into a specific role (permissive model) or have a more direct role, driving the HSCs down a specific differentiation lineage (instructive model) . Permissive signaling . This suggests that the role of cytokines is to allow the survival of HSCs, which enables them to fully differentiate . Instructive signaling . In one study, the exogenous expression of specific cytokine receptors (interleukin-2 and GM-CSF) in progenitor cells that had already commenced lymphoid development enabled transdifferentiation of the cells into myeloid development . This study suggests that cytokine signaling can regulate cell-fate decisions . Overlapping role of cytokines . Different cytokines can activate the same receptors, and different receptors can have overlapping downstream effects . The role of specific transcription factors . Transcription factors are vital in the regulation of hematopoiesis . One important master regulator of hematopoiesis is the gene RUNX1 (AML1) . This gene is essential for the emergence of HSCs in the developing embryo . The importance of transcription factors in hematopoiesis is underlined by the ability of C/EBPalpha to transdifferentiate cells into neutrophils (see Figure 1.3) . Using retroviral vectors, overexpression of CEBPA can rapidly force lymphoid progenitors, lymphocytes and even AML cells into mature myeloid cells such as neutrophils . Finally, there is an appreciation that transcription factors regulate each other's activities and form a network that defines the identity and function of each cell . ",Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop into terminally differentiated myeloid and lymphoid cells through intermediate progenitor cells. The lineage of hematopoietic cells has been extensively studied using flow cytometry and traditional transplantation techniques. The precursors of fully differentiated blood cells have intermediate properties between the final cells and the HSCs. Developmental potential becomes increasingly restricted. The self-renewal of HSCs is a highly regulated process that provides a continuous source of blood cells in adult humans. Cytokines such as interferon-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor provide signals to HSCs to proliferate and differentiate. Transcription factors are also vital in the regulation of hematopoiesis.
9783318067095,ch9,"Understanding the processes . Once you have arrived at a construct to measure and you have some ideas about the way a digital tool could be used to measure it, there are a number of ways to assure yourself and others that the tool generates high-quality, meaningful and trustworthy data . They apply to digital medicine, too . Verification is the assessment of sensor accuracy (which describes the agreement between the measurement made by a single sensor versus a ground truth), precision (which describes the agreement between multiple measurements made by a single sensor back-to-back), consistency (which describes the agreement between multiple measurements made by a single sensor over longer time periods) and/or uniformity (which describes the agreement across measurements made by multiple sensors simultaneously) . By undertaking verification assessments, the investigator can also be assured that the relevant firmware/software that generates processed data is also accurate, precise, consistent and uniform . Validation is the process of ensuring that the digital measurement tool is meeting its intended use by generating objective data that accurately represent the concept of interest - the specific way in which the patient feels, functions or survives - that it purports to be measuring . Validation answers the question 'did I build the right tool?' The concept of validation can be broken down as follows . Is the algorithm processing the data to report the measurement of interest? For example, is the algorithm accurately processing raw accelerometry data to calculate gait speed in a particular patient population? . Clinical validation . Is the measurement of interest reflecting the concept of interest - the specific way in which the patient feels, functions or survives? For example, is gait speed a meaningful measure that reflects how a particular patient population feels, functions or survives? . To answer whether the technology is measuring what it is intended to measure (clinical validation) and is correct (analytic validation), developers should work with researchers to ensure that validation studies are well designed . Separating the sensor and the measure is the most important concept to remember when considering VandV . All sensors can be boiled down to the physical construct that is measured, such as acceleration, temperature or pressure . The process of verification evaluates the capture and transference of a sensor-generated signal into collected data . Validation almost always involves human subject testing; it is the process of ensuring that the output data from the technology are accurate against a gold standard (analytic validation) and an appropriate reflection of the clinical concept of interest (clinical validation) . Clinical validation has multiple dimensions . We will not go into all of them here, but one example is whether a change in your new measurement is regarded as meaningful by people with the disease . Often, researchers will ask how a novel digital measure compares with a gold-standard assessment . We believe 'gold standard' is often a misnomer because many gold standards are not necessarily high-quality measures . This is a poor endpoint for a number of reasons . First, it does not apply to the roughly 60% of that patient population who are confined to a wheelchair and cannot participate in a walk test . Finally, many consider that the 6-minute walk test fails to demonstrate strong ecological validity, that is, it is a poor measure of how test performance predicts behaviors in real-world settings . offer an excellent exploration of the ecological validity of mobility outcomes, including the 6-minute walk test, in multiple sclerosis and consider the opportunities for digital tools to improve these measures . In fact, for this reason, digital measures garner a lot of excitement: they may turn out to be more sensitive than traditional measures or be capable of measuring something researchers have never been able to measure before . In other instances, a digital assessment may measure an aspect of disease that has been inaccessible with traditional measures . If it requires medical knowledge, it is validation . When is something 'validated' enough? . Tools need to be fit for purpose . Increasing overlap between clinical research and care . Historically, measures that support research (endpoints) and care (outcomes) were siloed . But that is changing: many clinically validated endpoints used in research will likely transition into clinical care . A number of companies are working toward a universal vision of human digital measurement across the continuum of research and clinical care . Clinical research provides a practical approach by which we can link (or validate) everyday behaviors and outcomes . Companies that develop digital biomarkers validate these tools through clinical research as a first step toward what may eventually become a validated digital diagnostic or a digital therapeutic . Similarly, a number of big tech companies are also developing digital measures for clinical settings . ","Verification evaluates the capture and transference of a sensor-generated signal into collected data. The goal of verification testing is to ensure that the sensor is accurate, precise, consistent and uniform. This usually does not require human subjects. Validation ensures that the technology is measuring what it is intended to measure. It almost always requires human subjects. Validation comprises two types of testing:Analytic validation: does the device process the raw data to produce the measure of interest (exempli gratia convert raw accelerometry data to gait speed in a particular patient population)?Clinical validation: do changes to the measure of interest predict future clinical outcomes (exempli gratia is gait speed a marker of disease progression)?The level of validation associated with a digital measure should be sufficient to support its context of use, a regulatory term that refers to a description of how the tool is used and where it is applied.There is increasing overlap between clinical research and care.

9781908541406,ch_10,"Although hemophilia A and B are the most common severe coagulation disorders, congenital and acquired deficiencies of all the other clotting factors occur and can lead to a range of bleeding states that may cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties . These uncommon disorders include deficiencies of factor (F)II, FV, FVII, FX, FXI and FXIII and multiple factor deficiencies of the vitamin-K-dependent factors . Most of these disorders have autosomal-recessive traits; heterozygote individuals are asymptomatic, with clotting factor levels of about 50% . In homozygous, or compound heterozygote, individuals the level of the deficient clotting factor is very low . The frequency of severe bleeding in these disorders is shown in Figure 8.1 . As well as congenital disorders, acquired clotting factor deficiencies can result from their increased consumption (in association with massive hemorrhage or major surgery) or the presence of an autoantibody against a single clotting factor . Fibrinogen deficiency . Deficiency is associated with both bleeding and venous thrombotic manifestations . The risk of bleeding is related to the clottable fibrinogen level . Treatment or prevention of bleeding is with a virally inactivated plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate . Factor II deficiency . Bleeding manifestations are similar to those with deficiencies of FVII and FX . Newborns can present with hematomas, umbilical cord bleeding and bleeding following circumcision . Volume overload may occur with fresh frozen plasma and thrombosis with prothrombin complex concentrate . Factor V deficiency . Congenital FV deficiency is a rare recessively inherited disorder . It has been suggested that the level of FV in platelets is a better reflection of the bleeding potential than its plasma concentration . Combined factor V and factor VIII deficiency . Combined deficiency of FV and FVIII is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder . Factor VII deficiency . Congenital FVII deficiency is an uncommon autosomal recessive disorder . However, the correlation between bleeding risk and FVII level is poor . In patients with severe FVII deficiency (< 2% levels) bleeding into the CNS very early in life leads to a high morbidity and mortality . Rarely, a deficiency is observed in patients taking a penicillin or cephalosporin, and it has also been reported in patients with myeloma and sepsis . Treatment of choice is recombinant human FVIIa concentrate, but virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma or a plasma-derived FVII concentrate can be used to treat acute bleeds or to cover surgery . Factor X deficiency . The bleeding propensity is related to the FX plasma level . A concentrate consisting solely of FX is under development . For those with severe FX deficiency, bleeding is prevented by daily infusions of 20 IU/kg . Factor XI deficiency . Individuals who are heterozygous for a mutation have a partial deficiency of FXI, whereas those who have a severe deficiency are either homozygous or compound heterozygotes . The deficiency is classified as severe if the FXI level is less than 20 IU/dL and partial at 20-70 IU/dL; the lower limit of the normal range is 60-70 IU/dL . Unlike hemophilia A and B, the correlation between the plasma FXI level and the propensity to bleed is poor . Bleeding usually arises following surgery, particularly dental extraction, tonsillectomy, prostatectomy and appendectomy . Before surgery the postoperative bleeding risk should be assessed based on the patient's hemorrhagic history after previous surgery, FXI level and severity of the impending operation . The FXI level may need to be raised in those with a severe deficiency who are undergoing major surgery . Combined deficiencies of factors II, VII, IX and X . This condition must be distinguished from acquired deficiencies caused by liver disease or warfarin . Factor XIII deficiency . Congenital deficiency of FXIII is a rare autosomal recessive disorder . The severity of the bleeding state is related to the FXIII plasma levels . Acquired deficiency develops in patients in intensive care units following major surgery, and occasionally is of autoimmune origin . For surgery the level should be kept above 30%, and this can be accomplished with a virally inactivated plasma-derived FXIII concentrate . ","Fibrinogen deficiency Congenital hypofibrinogenemia predisposes to venous thromboembolism, postoperative and postpartum hemorrhage and placental abruption. As fibrinogen has a long half-life of 5 days, effective prophylaxis can be readily achieved for surgery and throughout pregnancy. Factor VII deficiency Bleeding is uncommon in factor (F)VII heterozygotes. Individuals with severe FVII deficiency are usually homozygous and originate from consanguineous marriages. Bleeding is common in patients with severe FVII deficiency; it can be severe, and can include intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment with recombinant human FVIIa is effective and should be given prophylactically. FXI deficiency Family members should be fully investigated for both FXI clotting activity and the mutation(s) in the gene, because compound heterozygotes are common. Unlike hemophilia A, the level of FXI is not a good predictor of bleeding risk. FXI concentrates should be used with caution, because they predispose to arterial and venous thromboembolism. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective therapy, but exposure to normal FXI in plasma or concentrates carries a risk of inhibitor development in those with type 2 disease."
9781910797181,ch01,"The cigarette . Additives are included in cigarettes by the manufacturers to engineer an attractive and efficient nicotine delivery system . One thing that all cigarettes have in common is that they deliver nicotine to the lungs . A puff on a cigarette results in rapid absorption of nicotine into the bloodstream and delivery of a high-concentration 'bolus' of nicotine to the brain by the arterial circulation (Figure 1.1); this process is repeated with every puff . In the UK and the USA, smokers absorb an average 1-2 mg of nicotine from each cigarette . In societies in which cigarettes are more expensive relative to earnings or in situations where cigarettes are otherwise not freely available, smokers take more nicotine from each cigarette, confirming that nicotine is the sought-after substance in tobacco . Control of the nicotine dose . As a drug delivery system, cigarettes are very flexible because smokers can control the intensity and frequency of puffing . This 'fingertip control' of the nicotine dose allows smokers to meet their current need while avoiding the acute adverse effects of too much nicotine . Many smokers, particularly older smokers and women, choose so-called 'light' or 'low-tar' brands, believing that these are safer . According to the reported analyses of their deliveries, these brands deliver as little as one-tenth of the tar and carbon monoxide of other brands . In fact, such reports are misleading: the data are based on artificial measurements by smoking machines and do not mirror the actual delivery to a smoker . Each smoker appears to have a preferred level of nicotine intake and will adjust the way he or she smokes to achieve that level . Recognizing this, the terms 'light' and 'low tar' have been banned from cigarette packaging and marketing in the USA and EU . Smokers who reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke typically compensate for the change by increasing the intensity of smoking such that smoke exposure remains unchanged . An exception is when they use another nicotine product at the same time, such as a nicotine patch or gum (see Chapter 7) . Nicotine and its elimination from the body . Nicotine is an alkaloid obtained from tobacco plants and has wide-ranging effects on the central nervous system (CNS) (see pages 37-8) . Once in the bloodstream, nicotine is distributed around the body, readily crossing cell membranes and entering every tissue . It is metabolized mostly to the oxides cotinine and nicotine-1'-N-oxide . The plasma concentration of nicotine reduces by half every 90-120 minutes (its half-life; see Figure 1.1) . Duration of withdrawal symptoms . All nicotine is cleared from the body within a day or two of abstinence . Some people think that this must therefore be the period when smokers experience withdrawal symptoms (see Chapter 5) . However, the duration of withdrawal symptoms has nothing to do with this; it is related to how long it takes the body to get used to not having nicotine in the system . Estimating nicotine intake . Nicotine concentrations in the blood could conceptually be a useful index of dependence, but its short half-life means that a single measure does not give a particularly accurate picture of total intake over a day . Measurement of its metabolite, cotinine, is used instead . Cotinine has a half-life of 14-20 hours, so its concentration in the blood is more stable than that of nicotine and it can be easily measured in saliva, urine or even hair . Saliva samples are simple to obtain by means of a dental swab and are the method of choice for accurate estimation of daily nicotine intake . A daily nicotine intake of 16 mg (approximately 16 cigarettes/day, or one every hour) corresponds on average to a saliva cotinine concentration of 200 ng/mL; a daily nicotine intake of 10 mg generates a saliva cotinine concentration of about 125 ng/mL . These estimations are not the same for urine or blood measurements . Monoamine oxidase inhibitors in cigarette smoke . In the case of smoking, they might contribute to the rewarding effect of cigarette smoke or act synergistically with nicotine (which is primarily rewarding as it causes release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens - see Chapter 5) . This may help explain why people who suffer from depression are particularly likely to smoke . Research is in its early days, but if MAOIs play a role in cigarette addiction, pure nicotine delivery systems may be less addictive, even if they deliver nicotine as rapidly as cigarettes . ","Cigarettes deliver a 'bolus' of nicotine to the brain within seconds of each puff. Smokers absorb an average 1-2 mg of nicotine per cigarette (more when cigarettes are smoked more intensively). Cigarettes also deliver tar, containing potent carcinogens, and carbon monoxide. Smokers' intake of tar and nicotine from so-called 'low-tar' cigarettes is not substantially lower than the intake from higher-tar cigarettes. Nicotine is rapidly metabolized and excreted; its concentration in the blood halves every 90-120 minutes. Almost all the nicotine is cleared over a day of abstinence. The nicotine metabolite cotinine is eliminated much more slowly and is present in all body fluids, including saliva and urine; measurement of saliva or urine cotinine content is therefore a useful means of assessing total nicotine intake over the past few days."
9781910797853,chp7,"Rapid assessment of the patient to determine their suitability for treatment of differing intensities is also crucial . However, at diagnosis and relapse, patients often present with urgent complications secondary to bone marrow failure or as a result of the treatment of these complications, which require emergency care . As discussed in Chapter 6, patients with leukemia are at high risk of infection as a result of the immune dysfunction caused by the disease itself and cytotoxic treatments . Any neutropenic patient with signs of a systemic inflammatory reaction is likely to have sepsis . Coagulopathy in acute promyelocytic leukemia . This is primarily due to the increased bleeding risk in uncontrolled APML . Tumor lysis syndrome . Tumor lysis syndrome may arise spontaneously as a result of the rapid turnover of leukemic cells, but it occurs more frequently in the first few days after chemotherapy is initiated . Tumor lysis syndrome is potentially life-threatening because it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or acute renal failure, and patients may require organ support in an intensive therapy unit . Laboratory and clinical tumor lysis syndrome . The formal definition of tumor lysis syndrome is based on a review by Cairo and Bishop . They defined laboratory tumor lysis syndrome as the presence of two or more abnormalities in potassium, phosphate, uric acid or calcium levels . Clinical tumor lysis syndrome is present when patients have one of the laboratory criteria and at least one of the following: seizure, acute renal failure, elevated creatinine levels, cardiac arrhythmia or death . The risk of tumor lysis syndrome is dependent on patient factors as well as disease factors (Table 7.2) . For example, elderly patients with pre-existing renal impairment are at an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome . The approach to managing tumor lysis syndrome can be divided into prophylaxis and treatment . As a universal measure, all patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome should be given at least 3 liters of fluid intravenously over 24 hours to maintain good diuresis . The choice of pharmaceutical prophylaxis depends on the patient's risk of tumor lysis syndrome . Allopurinol is not the drug of choice for treating established tumor lysis syndrome . Tumor lysis syndrome is primarily an issue in patients with acute leukemias . However, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax are also at risk and need careful monitoring when starting this agent . Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis . However, the ability of patients to tolerate different WBC counts depends on the underlying type of leukemia; for example, patients with CLL may tolerate a far higher WBC count than those with AML . Leukostasis is a medical emergency . It is more commonly seen in patients with AML, but symptomatic leukostasis may also be associated with a blast crisis in chronic myeloid leukemia . In some men, leukostasis may result in a painful priapism . The management of leukostasis depends on whether the patient is symptomatic: patients may be hypoxic from pulmonary hemorrhage or confused from cerebral leukostasis . Differentiation syndrome . The use of ATRA and arsenic trioxide in the treatment of APML has been associated with the development of differentiation syndrome, a potentially severe complication that can affect approximately 25% of patients during the induction phase of treatment . In severe cases, patients may require organ support in an intensive care setting . It is important to be vigilant for differentiation syndrome because it is easily confused with concurrent illnesses, such as infections . Management of differentiation syndrome centers on the use of intravenous dexamethasone, 10 mg twice daily, until the syndrome settles . Although there is little evidence to support it, prophylactic corticosteroid treatment is commonly used, especially in patients at high risk of differentiation syndrome . Treatment with ATRA or arsenic trioxide is usually continued unless the syndrome is particularly severe (exempli gratia if the patient requires organ support), in which case treatment may be temporarily suspended while the syndrome is resolved . Asparaginase-related thromboses in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . L -asparaginase is a vital component of pediatric and adult treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and it has been part of the encouraging improvements in outcomes for patients with this leukemia . ","Sepsis should be treated immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics; intravenous fluids and oxygen should be given as needed. The high risk of bleeding in uncontrolled acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) represents a medical emergency. To prevent coagulopathy, anti-leukemic therapy should be initiated as soon as possible alongside meticulous supportive care. Tumor lysis syndrome may arise spontaneously but is more frequent in the early days of chemotherapy, when massive numbers of tumor cells are being destroyed. All patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome should be given intravenous fluids to maintain good diuresis. Both allopurinol and rasburicase can be used as prophylaxis in tumor lysis syndrome depending on the patient's risk level. However, they should not be used together. Hyperleukocytosis is a frequent finding in both chronic and acute leukemias, but leukostasis tends to be more common in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Rapid reductions in white blood cell counts can be achieved with leukapheresis, but concomitant chemotherapy is needed to maintain leukodepletion. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide has led to impressive improvements in survival rates in APML, but their use may be associated with the development of differentiation syndrome. This can be managed with intravenous dexamethasone, 10 mg twice a day. An increased incidence of thromboses in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is probably linked to treatment with regimens containing L -asparaginase. To help reduce the incidence of thromboses, placement of central venous catheters should be avoided during the induction phase of treatment with these regimens."
9781910797495,chp5,"The diagnosis of CRPS requires the presence of several factors, which may include sensory, vascular and motor abnormalities as well as edema and sweating abnormalities . Motor abnormalities, found in 50% of patients with CRPS, are most probably generated by changes in brain motor neurons . Baron's group in Germany has reported disturbed integration of visual and proprioceptive inputs in the posterior parietal cortices of patients with CRPS . Also, functional MRI during finger tapping of the affected limb in patients with CRPS showed reorganization of central motor circuits . Thus, it seems clear that maladaptive changes in the brain motor system contribute to motor symptoms in patients with CRPS . Behavioral/physical treatments aimed at motor components of CRPS in the brain have been described as 'reprogramming the brain' . Skin biopsies in the affected limbs of patients with CRPS show evidence of ongoing inflammation . There is also some evidence of an autoimmune response in patients with CRPS - possibly triggered by infection with Campylobacter species . Sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) refers to a subset of CRPS patients whose pain is relieved (at least on a temporary basis) by a correctly applied sympatholytic intervention . The actual mechanism of the linkage is different in CRPS I compared with CRPS II . The evidence is less clear for CRPS I . The percentage of pain that depends on sympathetic activity declines during the course of CRPS . As with most patients with neuropathic pain conditions, psychological distress activates the sympathetic system, and this accounts for the worsening of CRPS pain . There is no evidence of a 'CRPS personality' . Three literature reviews found little consistent information, and consequently the treatment for CRPS is often based on studies of outcomes from treatment of other neuropathic pain syndromes . Physical and occupational therapies . Physical therapy and, to a lesser extent, occupational therapy can reduce pain and improve active mobility in CRPS I . Psychological therapy . In the authors' experience, CBT, which helps patients develop coping skills for managing stress in CRPS pain, is a crucial component of treatment and is essential in CRPS of long duration . There are no studies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in CRPS . There are no studies of opioids in CRPS . Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the benefits of calcitonin in patients with CRPS have shown a small effect at best . Two small single-blind RCTs reported a decrease in pain in patients with acute CRPS after treatment with corticosteroids . CRPS is associated with increased bone resorption and patchy osteoporosis . Although antidepressants are known to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, only one trial has been conducted in patients with CRPS . Although these are effective treatments for neuropathic pain, their use for the treatment of CRPS has not been evaluated, with the exception of one trial that evaluated gabapentin in 307 people with neuropathic pain, 85 of whom had CRPS types I or II . Intrathecal baclofen effectively relieves the dystonia of CRPS . Treatment early in the course of CRPS appears to be more effective than in well-established CRPS . Invasive procedures should not be considered in the early treatment of CRPS . Although some case series have reported beneficial effects, there are no rigorous data for patients with CRPS . However, a trial of epidural clonidine may be appropriate for patients with intractable CRPS, and may help the patient start weight bearing and other activity focused on functional restoration . Patients known to have had a previous episode of CRPS, or who are currently suffering from CRPS, are at risk of triggering or exacerbating CRPS if they undergo surgery of the affected limb or suffer trauma to the limb . There are reports that contralateral injuries may also trigger or exacerbate CRPS . Stellate ganglion block before upper limb surgery in patients with a prior history of CRPS reduced the recurrence rate in one study . Rarely, epidural clonidine is used where there is severe risk of CRPS exacerbation . The severity of CRPS, rather than its etiology, seems to determine the disease course . Thus, early intervention to reduce the severity of CRPS is vital . In CRPS II, more than 60% of patients were unchanged after 1 year of intensive therapy . ","Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) involves abnormalities in sensation, motor and sympathetic function, as well as edema and abnormal sweating, with possible trophic changes. The involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in CRPS is likely, but detailed mechanisms differ among patients and remain unclear. Diagnosis requires the presence of a number of symptoms and signs in the areas of sensory, motor and sympathetic function in the absence of any other condition that might account for the symptoms. Intravenous regional sympathetic blockade with guanethidine or systemic phentolamine lack efficacy. Local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic chain is a default clinical treatment for acute CRPS, but the scarcity of data from randomized controlled trials precludes any firm conclusion regarding its effectiveness. Sympathectomy by surgical division, chemical neurolysis or radiofrequency lesioning should be avoided. Pharmacotherapy largely relies on studies of treatment of other types of neuropathic pain. CRPS warrants a cognitive behavioral and rehabilitation treatment program to improve coping and function. Severe CRPS may benefit from a trial of spinal cord stimulation or lidocaine (lignocaine) infusions and/or dorsal rate ganglion stimulation. New strategies in 'reprogramming the brain' may be able to address the neuroplastic changes that occur with CRPS."
9781908541468,ch_4,"Plasma electrolyte and acid-base disturbances are common clinical problems . Mild hyponatremia (plasma sodium 130-135 mmol/L) is common and affects approximately 15-20% of hospitalized patients . More severe hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 130 mmol/L) is rarer and occurs in less than 1-4% of patients (Table 2.1) . Clinical features . Hyponatremia in conjunction with hypo-osmolality (as is common) causes clinical problems, especially when the plasma sodium concentration falls below 120 mmol/L, and patients usually complain of nausea and malaise . When the plasma sodium reaches 115 mmol/L, patients may complain of headache and become delirious . Seizures and coma are common when the plasma sodium falls below 110 mmol/L . Particular care must be taken when correcting hyponatremia in premenopausal women, children and those with very low plasma sodium levels (< 120 mmol/L) . Severe symptomatic hyponatremia may require treatment with hypertonic (3%) sodium chloride . A more aggressive correction rate of 2.0 mmol/L/hour may be considered in patients with seizures or severe neurological symptoms attributable to hyponatremia . However, their precise clinical role has yet to be elucidated . Hypernatremia (plasma sodium concentration >= 145 mmol/L) is common among hospitalized patients, particularly the elderly . Cellular dehydration follows, and shrinkage of brain cells causes most of the clinical manifestations . Clinical features . The speed with which hypernatremia develops also appears to modulate the severity of the clinical features . Severe, acute hypernatremia may result in irreversible vascular damage, particularly in children . Hypovolemic hypernatremic patients can be managed by administration of isotonic saline . Euvolemic hypernatremic patients can be treated with free water orally or 5% dextrose infusion . Too rapid correction is associated with brain edema, caused by the rapid movement of water into the brain, and seizures . Potassium disorders . Hypokalemia (plasma potassium <= 3.5 mmol/L) is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities in hospitalized patients (Table 2.5) . Clinical features largely reflect alterations in membrane polarization, especially in cardiac and skeletal muscle . Treatment of hypokalemia depends on its severity and duration, and the underlying clinical context . Giving no treatment carries the risk of tachyarrhythmias, while aggressive treatment with potassium may result in hyperkalemia . Treatment is recommended for patients with a plasma potassium level below 3 mmol/L, regardless of the duration and the clinical context . In normal individuals, mild hypokalemia (plasma potassium 3.0-3.5 mmol/L), particularly if chronic, may not need treatment . Hyperkalemia (plasma potassium > 5.0 mmol/L) is common (see Table 2.5) . Clinical features . The clinical effects of hyperkalemia particularly affect the heart . Ventricular fibrillation is the most severe consequence . Hyponatremic and hypocalcemic patients appear most vulnerable . Treatment of hyperkalemia depends on its severity and duration, and the clinical context . Disorders of calcium metabolism . Clinical features . Diagnosis always requires measurement of calcium corrected for serum albumin . The most common cause of hypercalcemia among hospitalized patients is an underlying malignancy, whereas in a community outpatient setting the most common cause is primary hyperparathyroidism (see Table 2.6) . Clinical features . Corticosteroids are commonly used for hematologic malignancies and are usually very effective . Acid-base disorders . Assessment of acid-base status . Lactic acidosis is often observed in critically ill hospitalized patients and reflects decreased tissue oxygenation . The treatment of metabolic acidosis depends on the underlying cause and the severity of manifestations . In patients with chronic metabolic acidosis, such as a patient with a renal tubular acidosis, oral repletion with sodium bicarbonate is sufficient . The most common causes are vomiting, diuretics and potassium depletion . Acute respiratory alkalosis occurs most commonly as a result of the hyperventilation syndrome . ","Electrolyte disturbances are very common and often iatrogenic. All electrolye disturbances require an accurate assessment of fluid balance. Intake and excretion of solutes, and drugs, must be considered when trying to identify causes. Correction should generally be cautious."
9781908541468,ch_11,"Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder, which is most commonly (but not only) caused by infection . UTI is the second most common infection after respiratory infection and, in the elderly, is the most common source of Gram-negative bacteremia . However, UTI is generally a disease of sexually active females; 1 in 3 women will develop a UTI during her lifetime, and 20% have a recurrence . In the UK, UTIs are the second largest single group of healthcare-associated infections and make up 20% of all hospital-acquired infections . In primary care, UTIs make up 1-3% of all practitioner consultations . Also see Urinary tract infections and cystitis in Fast Facts: Bladder Disorders . Causes and risk factors . Most UTIs are caused by Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (Table 9.1) . In over 50% of patients, bacteria ascend further up the ureters to the kidneys . Host factors predisposing to UTI are shown in Table 9.2 . Sexual intercourse triggers UTI in some women for unknown reasons . Urinary catheterization can also cause UTIs by introducing bacteria into the urinary tract . In infants, bacteria from soiled diapers can enter the urethra and cause UTI . Most patients respond rapidly to therapy . Hospitalization of patients with a UTI is unnecessary unless there is systemic toxicity and/or the patient requires intravenous antibiotic therapy . UTI syndromes . UTI may be either uncomplicated or complicated . Uncomplicated UTI occurs in healthy (usually) women in the community . Complicated UTI occurs because of the presence of an underlying anatomic, functional or pharmacological factor that predisposes to persistent or recurrent infection, or treatment failure (Table 9.4) . About one-third of all UTIs are complicated . The different categories, criteria for diagnosis and treatment of both complicated and uncomplicated UTIs are summarized in Table 9.5 . Acute cystitis in young women is the most common category of UTI and occurs in young, sexually active women . The urine is often turbid, and gross hematuria occurs in about 30% of patients . Uncomplicated cystitis is most commonly caused by E . Recurrent cystitis in young women . It is important to perform a urine culture to differentiate between relapse (infection with the same organism) and recurrence (infection with different organisms) . Multiple infections caused by the same organism require longer courses of antibiotics and possibly further diagnostic tests . In contrast, infections caused by different organisms are generally not associated with underlying anatomic abnormalities and do not require further investigation of the genitourinary tract . However, stopping antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with recurrence in over 50% of patients . A diagnosis of UTI can be made with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity if the patient has symptoms of UTI and bacteriuria of more than 10 CFU/mL of urine . In complicated UTI, further diagnostic investigations should be performed, but no further action may be necessary in younger men who respond rapidly to treatment . Urethral syndrome occurs in women complaining of recurrent dysuria and frequency, but with sterile urine or low bacterial counts that have not responded to antibiotics . The commonest organisms are E . For patients with a mild presentation, oral therapy is sufficient (see Table 9.5) . Between 2-10% of pregnancies are complicated by UTI; if left untreated, 25-30% of the women affected will develop pyelonephritis . Catheter-associated urinary tract infection . Therefore, bacteriuria is inevitable in patients undergoing long-term catheterization . Catheter-associated UTIs account for 40% of all nosocomial infections and are the most common source of Gram-negative bacteremia in hospitalized patients . Patients with mild-to-moderate infections may be treated with an oral quinolone, usually for 10-14 days . Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary for patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medication . Treatment is not recommended for catheterized patients who have asymptomatic bacteriuria, with the exception of patients who are immunosuppressed after organ transplantation, patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis and patients who are about to undergo urinary tract instrumentation . ","Uncomplicated cystitis in women, diagnosed by history and pyuria, can be treated empirically with short courses of antibiotics. Recurrent cystitis in women may require longer courses of, or prophylactic, antibiotics. Cystitis in men generally requires a formal urologic assessment. Pyelonephritis usually requires intravenous antibiotics as initial treatment."
9781908541796,chapter11,"Supportive care is a vital component of lymphoma management, and indeed the management of all cancers, because it underpins all other treatment modalities . It can be defined as treatment aimed at alleviating symptoms and complications caused by the underlying cancer (Table 11.1) or its management (see Chapter 10) . Pain is one of the most feared complications of any cancer, but is uncommon with lymphoma . pleural or peritoneal involvement . It must be borne in mind that pain often cannot be wholly assigned to a single physical cause . Pain is a complex physiological and emotional experience, and not simply a sensation . Anxiety or depression may lower the threshold for physical pain and such psychological problems may also be caused by persistent pain, leading to a vicious circle . A holistic approach to pain management is important, with attention being paid to the doctor-patient or carer-patient relationship . It is useful to consider pain as nociceptive or neuropathic (Table 11.2) . This is not only conceptually useful, but can also guide treatment . Pain can be managed by treating the cause and by using analgesic drugs (Figure 11.1) . Treating lymphoma with chemotherapy may improve pain . Localized pain may also be effectively treated with radiotherapy to the painful area . For more information see Fast Facts: Chronic and Cancer Pain . Nausea is one of the most debilitating symptoms associated with the treatment of lymphoma with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Factors that must be considered include . drugs such as chemotherapy, opioids and antibiotics . raised intracranial pressure (exempli gratia brain involvement with lymphoma) . Treatment of nausea and vomiting includes both drug and non-drug interventions . Avoiding large meals can be helpful, but the patient must be encouraged to snack regularly to maintain energy intake . Some patients have found an acupuncture wrist band beneficial . Various classes of drugs have an antiemetic action and some drugs are particularly useful for certain causes of nausea (Table 11.3) . Persistent tiredness related to lymphoma or its treatment is common and can be debilitating . Potential causes of persistent fatigue include . chronic infection . chemotherapy/radiotherapy . Perhaps the most common cause is the expected and reversible effect of chemotherapy . Patients should be reassured that this effect will improve at the end of their treatment although it may take weeks or months . The treatment of cancer-related fatigue involves non-drug and drug treatments . The mainstay of non-drug treatment of fatigue is to create a moderate exercise program . Drug treatments are not universally successful and may have severe side effects . Erythropoietin has been shown to be beneficial in anemic patients undergoing chemotherapy (see opposite) . The most common cause of anemia in lymphoma patients is bone-marrow suppression caused by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . It has been shown to reduce red cell requirements and improve quality of life in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . Unfortunately, only about 50% of patients respond and it is very difficult to identify non-responders without giving a trial of the drug . Such an infection is termed neutropenic sepsis and is a medical emergency . Urgent assessment is needed for a neutropenic patient with fever . If the patient is stable, take a short history and perform a physical examination to identify the source of the infection (exempli gratia line infection, chest infection, urinary tract infection) . Always check for a history of allergy before administering any medications . It is important to reassure them that most infections arise from the patient's own bacterial flora . Avoid intramuscular injections, which may result in painful intramuscular hematomas . Tumor lysis syndrome . Tumor lysis syndrome is a potentially devastating complication of aggressive lymphomas and their treatment . When a cell dies, it results in the release of . The key to managing tumor lysis syndrome is to recognize patients who are at risk (Table 11.5) and to institute effective preventive measures as follows . For patients at low risk, allopurinol may be given orally; this prevents uric acid production but may increase deposition of other compounds . Cardiac monitoring may be appropriate in high-risk cases . Treatment of established tumor lysis syndrome is aimed at treating the effects of the metabolic derangements . ","Supportive care is aimed at managing the complications of treatment for lymphoma or of the lymphoma itself. Effective supportive care involves a multidisciplinary and holistic approach, with consideration of psychosocial and physical factors. Effective analgesia and antiemesis has revolutionized supportive care, but fatigue remains debilitating, common and hard to manage. Bone-marrow suppression is a common complication of lymphoma therapy and results in anemia, a low platelet count with bleeding, and a low white cell count and infection risk. Anemia may be treated with recombinant human erythropoietin or blood transfusions. If sufficiently severe, a low platelet count may be treated with platelet transfusions. The treatment of neutropenic sepsis is a medical emergency and requires prompt assessment by a medical team with rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Tumor lysis syndrome is a serious complication of aggressive lymphomas. Recognizing patients at high risk and implementing effective preventive measures is the mainstay of treatment."
9781910797273,chp7,"It is important to ask patients with MS about their plans for pregnancy early so as to balance medical interventions against the risks to the baby and mother; this should, ideally, result in planned pregnancies . Effects of multiple sclerosis on pregnancy . It is important to note that while a diagnosis of MS may influence pregnancy planning, it does not affect fertility . Effects of pregnancy on multiple sclerosis . Pregnancy is a physiological state that involves relative immunologic modulation . Pregnancy appears to have a favorable effect on MS, with reduced rates of relapse, especially in the third trimester . Previous reports of postpartum deterioration in MS have not been seen in robust studies, and pregnancy does not appear to affect disease progression . Possible reasons why pregnancy affects relapse rate include . Treating relapses in pregnancy . There are no guidelines on the treatment of relapse in pregnancy . Although there is limited information on the effect of steroid therapy in pregnancy, steroids are generally considered to be relatively safe . The progesterone-only or combined oral contraceptive pills have no known adverse effect on MS . Disease-modifying treatments . Pregnancy should be planned and the potential risks and benefits of therapy discussed in advance . In patients with active relapsing MS, maintenance of glatiramer acetate through pregnancy has been advocated by some groups; the risk-benefit analysis should be assessed and discussed with the individual patient . Other disease-modifying therapies . The ability to breast-feed is typically not affected in patients with MS and does not affect the risk of relapse in the postpartum period . Other comorbidities associated with pregnancy . Pediatric MS is defined as MS with onset under the age of 16-18 years (depending on the study) . The majority of children with MS (> 95%) have the relapsing remitting subtype of the disease . MS is more common in girls than boys who are diagnosed after puberty . Initial presentation . Most children have a multifocal presentation, with more than one anatomic site affected . Monofocal presentations are more common in adolescents . Presenting symptoms are shown in Table 7.1 . ADEM can only be confidently distinguished from MS by adequate follow up . Other differential diagnoses in children are shown in Table 7.2 . Risk in children . The risk is almost 30% in children with an encephalopathic ADEM-like presentation . Oligoclonal bands (see pages 41 -) are found in 90% of children with MS, although not all children are positive at the time of the initial lumbar puncture . They are less frequently found in children with ADEM or NMO . There is no serological test for MS . MS may present following viral or other infection and positive serological tests do not distinguish MS from ADEM, which is more commonly preceded by infection ('post-infectious encephalomyelitis') . Fatigue contributing to absence from school is noted in 40% of children with MS, and seizures occur in approximately 5% . The EDSS score in children rises with disease duration . On average, it takes children with MS 10 years longer to reach EDSS 7-10 than adults with MS . Progression to the secondary progressive stage of MS is primarily determined by disease duration . In children, it is important to ensure that the diagnosis of MS is firm before proceeding with treatment . A multidisciplinary approach is essential, and clear communication with children with MS and their parents is paramount . Relapse therapy . Corticosteroid therapy is used for treatment of disabling relapses . Disease-modifying therapies . There are also ongoing randomized clinical trials with teriflunomide in pediatric-onset MS . The elderly . Elderly patients with MS may have either longstanding 'conventional' adult-onset MS, or the late-onset MS subtype, which is defined as MS with symptom onset after the age of 50 years . In the latter group, a disproportionately higher number of patients have the primary progressive type of MS . Late-onset MS commonly presents with motor symptoms, while optic neuritis and sensory symptoms are relatively uncommon . In one study, the cause of death in 15% of elderly patients with MS was suicide . In this regard, a multidisciplinary team is best placed to manage the elderly patient with MS . ","Multiple sclerosis does not affect fertility. The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) does not affect MS, and MS does not affect the efficacy of the OCP. Ideally, pregnancy in patients with MS should be planned and managed with both obstetric and neurological input. Pregnancy may result in reduced relapse risk, especially in the third trimester, but does not affect the overall progression of MS. Relapses during pregnancy should be treated on a case-by-case basis with specialist input. Although data are limited, there is no evidence of teratogenicity with interferon beta (IFNbeta), glatiramer acetate or natalizumab therapy. In general, IFNbeta and glatiramer acetate therapy should be stopped before pregnancy is confirmed. In patients with highly active MS, an argument can be made to maintain glatiramer acetate provided the patient is cognizant of the potential risks. Methotrexate and teriflunomide must not be used before conception in male or female patients. Teriflunomide has a long half-life and must be appropriately 'washed out' before conception. There are insufficient data regarding fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate in pregnancy; however, cessation of these therapies before conception is recommended. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in patients with MS who have significant immobility. The ability to breast-feed is not affected unless the patient has significant motor impairment. Disease-modifying therapies should in general not be used when breast-feeding."
9781908541703,ch_8,"Follow-up . The 'lead time' achieved by a search for asymptomatic distant disease is of little value, as it contributes nothing to the survival or quality of life of the patient . Frequency and duration of follow-up . It is logical for surveillance to follow the hazard of relapse, which is highest after 2-3 years and low after 5 years . Therefore, a clinical examination every 3-4 months for the first 2-3 years and then every 6 months up to 5 years is appropriate, with yearly follow-up thereafter . For this approach to work, however, it is vital that the patient should be well informed and present promptly should symptoms develop . It should be remembered that regular and intensive follow-up does not improve the success rates for treatment of a recurrence . However, it may serve other purposes . The patient's perceived need for follow-up may mean that visiting her doctor regularly for reassurance (even if it is sometimes proven false) will improve her personal well-being . Physicians may also gain more job satisfaction by regularly seeing so many patients doing well rather than seeing only those patients who have had a recurrence . As neither of these possible benefits has been tested in randomized trials, it would be prudent to explain to the patient that regular follow-up, though offered, is not necessarily of proven value . In fact, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended that follow-up for breast cancer patients should stop after 3 years in England and Wales . The role of mammography in follow-up is somewhat controversial . Clinicians and patients alike need to be reassured that the risk of local relapse within the retained breast is similar to the risk of a contralateral breast cancer, which is about 4% over 10 years . The relative risk of dying from a contralateral breast cancer depends on the recurrence risk associated with the original tumor . It may be extremely small when compared with the risk of death from the original disease . Magnetic resonance imaging is often used in the follow-up period for patients whose cancer was initially mammographically occult or for whom the risk of a relapse or new cancer is considered high . Other tests . None of these tests has a high specificity, and the patient can therefore experience repeated false alarms . Patients undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer require rehabilitation to address the physical and psychological consequences of surgery . Physical rehabilitation . Physiotherapy can also reduce the risk of lymphedema after full axillary clearance . Breast prostheses are an important aspect of physical rehabilitation after mastectomy, and can also strongly influence psychological rehabilitation . Psychological rehabilitation . Breast cancer imposes considerable psychological stress and trauma . By contrast, the patient may be euphoric during the immediate postoperative period, possibly due to relief of uncertainty and anticipation of a return to normal life . This initial reaction is, however, transient, and many women experience a period of shock and denial followed by anxiety about 2-3 months after surgery . Approximately 20-30% of women, however, have persistent psychological or sexual problems 1-2 years after surgery, compared with 10% of age-matched women without breast cancer . This does not seem to be related to the type of operation; anxiety and depression appear to be as common in women undergoing conservative surgery as in women undergoing mastectomy . It is possible that while women undergoing conservative surgery are less concerned about the mutilating effect of surgery and perceived loss of femininity, they are more worried than mastectomy patients about the possibility of recurrence . Patients may also experience anxiety or depression in association with follow-up visits to the clinic, because of the fear that the cancer might recur . If recurrent disease is detected, the patient must again come to terms with the risk of death and the need for further treatment; major depression may occur in up to 50% of women with recurrent disease . Specialist nurse counselors can offer advice and emotional support throughout the processes of diagnosis and treatment, and can identify patients with psychological problems requiring treatment . It is important, however, that both the patient and the nurse recognize when such support is no longer needed; maintaining contact on a purely routine basis can foster a sense of being unwell in the patient, making her feel that she is unable to cope on her own . Volunteer groups, composed of women who have had breast cancer themselves, self-help groups and national cancer charities can also offer valuable help and advice to breast cancer patients and their families (see Useful resources) . ","Conventional belief in the need for intensive follow-up after treatment for primary breast cancer is being challenged, but it may have non-measurable benefits to the patient and their doctors and nurses. Attention must be paid to both physical and psychological rehabilitation. Simple physical exercises, initiated early, accelerate and improve rehabilitation. Short- and long-term emotional and spiritual support should not be overlooked."
9781912776207,ch5,"PTCL is invariably fatal within a few months without treatment . Relapsed and refractory PTCL is associated with dire clinical outcomes . Prognostic score, performance status and relevant comorbidities should be considered for each patient before deciding on treatment . Given that clinical outcomes are generally poor, involvement in a therapeutic clinical study should be considered whenever possible . Patients should also be offered the opportunity to contribute to regional or national PTCL biobanks, an essential resource for translational studies . First-line treatment for nodal PTCL . In fact, retrospective analysis of cases from the international T-cell Lymphoma Project did not show any survival benefit with anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with PTCL . Outcomes with CHOP are unsatisfactory for patients with PTCL: whilst initial complete responses are seen in 40-70% of patients, most develop refractory or relapsed disease, typically within 1-2 years of diagnosis . Intensified regimens have been used in an attempt to overcome the poor outcomes seen with CHOP . Modifying CHOP . However, 60% of these patients had ALCL, and a post-hoc subgroup analysis showed that this benefit held only for younger patients with ALK + ALCL . CHOP + alemtuzumab . High response rates with alemtuzumab-CHOP were reported in Phase II/III studies, whereas EFS was comparable to reported outcomes with CHOP alone but with significantly increased toxicity . Alternative chemotherapy backbones . Treatment of limited-stage PTCL . Treatment options include standard induction chemotherapy as described above, or a short course of CHOP-like chemotherapy (3 or 4 cycles) with involved-site radiotherapy . Radiotherapy alone is highly unlikely to provide adequate treatment for most cases . Treatment of specific subtypes . ALK + ALCL . Younger patients may benefit from the addition of etoposide (see above), whereas in older patients (> 60 years) this benefit appears to be offset by greater toxicity . Where there is evidence of tissue involvement beyond the capsule, patients are generally treated with protocols used for ALK − ALCL . A few patients have been treated with radiotherapy to the involved field . Aggressive intestinal lymphomas . EATL and MEITL are both highly aggressive, with very low response rates to CHOP-like chemotherapy - fewer than 10% of patients achieve long-term survival (id est 5 years) . Clinical outcomes were improved compared with historic controls treated with CHOP-like treatment, and this regimen has been adopted by many centers internationally . Most case series consistently report high failure rates with CHOP-like chemotherapy . Most experts recommend that patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease should proceed rapidly to consolidative allogeneic stem cell transplantation before disease relapse occurs . Aggressive ATLL is associated with poor clinical outcomes . Patients with newly diagnosed disease are often acutely ill, with poor performance status and high tumor burden . Autologous stem cell transplantation does not appear to provide any benefit . Patients with aggressive ATLL should be considered for clinical trials where possible . Localized disease . CHOP-based chemotherapy is associated with poor outcomes and should be avoided in patients with ENKTCL . Advanced disease . Aggressive NK cell leukemia . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation should be considered, where feasible, in patients who respond to induction chemotherapy . Radiotherapy is typically used as a consolidation strategy following a response to chemotherapy but may be used palliatively if chemotherapy fails . A range of radiotherapy techniques and doses have been used in the management of PTCL depending on tumor location and volume, intent of treatment, and patient characteristics . The role of PET-CT imaging to identify patients where radiotherapy can be safely omitted is as yet unclear . Data to support clear recommendations for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis in patients with PTCL are lacking . iPET has been reported to strongly predict PFS and OS in patients treated with CHOP-like chemotherapy, although these studies were retrospective and included relatively few patients . The prospective PETAL study assessed the clinical utility of iPET before cycle 3 of CHOP in 76 patients with PTCL: 25% were iPET positive and had significantly worse clinical outcomes; intensifying chemotherapy in these patients had no survival benefit . ","Insufficient understanding of the pathology of this heterogeneous group of rare diseases, together with a lack of randomized clinical trial data, has hindered progress in the treatment of PTCL, resulting in wide variation in practice. The use of intensive treatment strategies for nodal PTCL does not appear to improve outcomes. Improved survival with brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP chemotherapy in the ECHELON-2 trial heralded a new treatment standard in ALCL; however, the benefit in other PTCL subtypes is unclear. Extranodal PTCL has a dismal outcome with CHOP-based chemotherapy; alternative therapeutic chemotherapy strategies focused on distinct subtypes are therefore required."
9781910797631,chp3,"The origins of depression are best conceptualized by a biopsychosocial and lifestyle model, in which adverse life events trigger depression among vulnerable individuals . The risk for developing depression is related to a combination of factors . Risk factors place an individual at a greater likelihood of developing depression but do not predict onset with any certainty . The proportion of people in the population who are (or have been) depressed - termed prevalence - varies between studies . A systematic review of depression prevalence studies reported a pooled 12-month prevalence of 4.1% . Point prevalence . This relates to current depression; because of the way that depression is conceptualized, the survey questions focus on features of depression experienced over the preceding 2-week or 1-month period . Studies that have used diagnostic interview methods have generally found point prevalence rates for depression in adults of 2-4% . The depression rate obtained by structured interview in the latest () household survey of psychiatric morbidity in England was 3.3% . There is conflicting evidence as to whether depression prevalence has increased over time . The same relationship between age and risk of depression (and other mental disorders) was identified by national surveys in Australia and the USA . Studies in a range of settings have identified a strong association between current or past abuse and depression . Depression, like practically all health states and indicators, is inversely related to socioeconomic position . Socioeconomic adversity appears to predict the persistence of depression, with community epidemiology studies and examinations of depression management in primary care identifying this risk association . Whilst low socioeconomic status plays a causal role in depression development and persistence, it also appears that the experience of depression may lead to social and economic adversity . There are inconsistent findings concerning the relationship between ethnicity and depression prevalence and incidence . Studies of minority ethnic populations in New Zealand and Australia have found higher rates of depression in Maori and Aboriginal peoples . Depression in health professionals . Depression appears to be more common among doctors, nurses and other health professionals than in the general public . Similarly elevated rates of depression have been found among nurses in studies in Canada, the USA, Europe and China . Migration, mental health and depression . Related diagnoses . Milder forms of depression have been distinguished from major depressive disorder using terms such as subsyndromal depression, subthreshold depression and minor depression . Experiencing subthreshold symptoms of depression also increases the risk of developing depression that meets full diagnostic criteria, although cohort studies have indicated that the risk of progression to major depression is highest among people who have persistent depressive disorder . Persistent depressive disorder occurs less commonly than depression, with a typical lifetime prevalence of 6%, and a point prevalence of 1-3% obtained from surveys in the USA and European countries . Bipolar disorder is far less common than depression . Anxiety problems most commonly arise in early adolescence, and this remains the case when they accompany depression . Age at onset . Although anxiety disorders have a markedly younger age of onset than depression (the median onset age for anxiety disorders is 11 years), these often develop a shared morbidity with depression in later adulthood . Depression course . At least half of all people affected by depression experience more than one episode . A pattern of repeated episodes - including recurrence or relapse - may be the commonest expression of depressive disorder . Several studies indicate that depression recurrence may be a typical feature: the NCS-R found that for more than 90% of people identified with depression, this was a recurrence rather than an initial episode . On average, individuals with a history of depression will have five to nine separate depressive episodes in their lifetime . There is conflicting evidence as to whether early onset of depression is predictive of a recurrent course . Impact of depression . The disease burden due to depression is projected to rise during the coming decade . This is not necessarily related to increased depression incidence or the age at onset becoming younger . A significant part of the burden of depression relates to impairment of work function . This affects people with depression and those who experience depression together with medical conditions, where the odds of extended work loss and extended disability are synergistically affected by the disorder combination . Depressive disorders account for almost half of all claims attributed to a mental disorder . As well as reducing quality of life, this is likely to increase the risk for depression recurrence or persistence, as interpersonal relationships act as a buffer between adverse events and depression . Conversely, social isolation and loneliness are associated with worsening of depression outcome . ","Depression is a common mental disorder, affecting around 5% of the population over a 12-month period, with 10-15% of people likely to experience depression over the course of their lifetime. Women are nearly twice as likely to experience depression as men, and depression more commonly affects people who are divorced or separated, or who have experienced violence or abuse, as well as those experiencing socioeconomic adversity. In high- and middle-income countries, depression is the leading cause of disability and, primarily due to changes in demographic and disease distribution patterns, its contribution to global disability is projected to increase over future decades. Depression is related to a range of biological, sociocultural and psychological factors, and although there are strong links between adversity and its onset, these factors are not necessarily predictive of depression for individuals. At least half of all people affected by depression experience more than a single episode, and the risk of recurrence increases with each successive episode."
9781908541468,ch_13,"Urinary tract obstruction . Urinary tract obstruction or obstructive uropathy is defined as complete or partial obstruction of the flow of urine at any level of the urinary tract from the kidneys to the urethral meatus . Urinary tract obstruction is a relatively common cause of community-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI) (10% of cases) with an incidence of 23 cases per million population . Urinary tract obstruction has a bimodal age distribution, and is common in children and the elderly (> 60 years of age) . The functional effects of urinary tract obstruction are influenced by the level, severity and duration of obstruction . Short-term complete infravesical obstruction is invariably associated with AKI together with an enlarged bladder, hydroureter and hydronephrosis . Long-term complete infravesical obstruction may result in AKI or subacute kidney failure coupled with structural changes that are often irreversible . The level of obstruction and its duration governs the clinical presentation of urinary tract obstruction (Table 11.2) . If the obstruction is complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI) then symptoms associated with the infection are also usually present (see Chapter 9) . Urinary tract obstruction should be sought in any individual who presents with kidney failure of unknown cause . Sudden onset of complete anuria is highly suggestive of urinary tract obstruction, and ultrasound examination is the preferred diagnostic investigation . However, hydronephrosis is not always caused by obstruction . Hydronephrosis should be categorized as either obstructive or non-obstructive . With obstructive hydronephrosis, the degree of dilatation of the pelvicalyceal system may be an insensitive indicator of the severity of obstruction . Some patients with acute complete obstruction may initially have mild or no hydronephrosis, because of the brief duration of the obstruction, low urine production or external compression from a retroperitoneal process . Thus, a normal ultrasound examination does not exclude obstruction . In acute obstruction, the kidney cortex is intact, whereas chronic obstruction usually leads to marked thinning of the cortex . Failure to visualize the proximal ureter suggests obstruction at the pelviureteric junction, whereas a dilated ureter indicates an obstruction downstream, often at the level of the bladder . Therefore, it is essential to examine the entire urinary tract when hydronephrosis is present . Most patients should be referred for urologic evaluation, because untreated obstruction may result in irreversible parenchymal kidney injury . complete obstruction . obstruction in a solitary kidney . associated sepsis . More definitive surgical intervention will depend on the cause, type and duration of obstruction . Tumors of the urinary tract . Tumors of the urinary tract can involve the kidney, ureters, bladder, prostate or urethra . Only tumors of the kidney are discussed here . Benign kidney tumors . There are broadly four categories of benign kidney tumor: mesenchymal, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal, renal cell, and metanephric (Table 11.4) . Mesenchymal tumors . Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign mesenchymal neoplasm, and is considered by some to be the most common benign renal tumor . Cystic nephroma is a benign tumor observed predominantly in middle-aged perimenopausal women . Renal cell tumors . Oncocytomas account for approximately 5% of all adult primary renal epithelial neoplasms and 5-15% of surgically resected renal tumors . Papillary adenomas are the most common renal epithelial tumor, often incidentally discovered at postmortem examination . These tumors are histogenetically related to Wilm's tumor . Malignant kidney tumors . The most common malignant tumors are renal cell carcinoma and renal pelvic tumors in adults, and Wilm's tumor in children . Renal cell cancers often present late and have a relatively poor prognosis . These tumors present early with hematuria or obstruction, and are often associated with similar tumors in the ureters and bladder . The tumors may contain fibrous tissue, bone and fat . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors interfere with both tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation, resulting in reduced tumor vascularization and cancer cell death, and ultimately tumor shrinkage . ","Urinary tract obstruction is common and can lead to irreversible kidney failure if not recognized. An infected obstructed urinary system is a urologic emergency. Renal cell carcinoma often presents late, while transitional cell carcinoma of the kidney pelvis causes obstruction and presents early. Targeted therapies are expanding the treatment options for both benign and malignant kidney tumors."
9783318067095,ch6,"Society needs to decide how to create systems that will deliver real benefits while protecting citizen privacy and safety . For example, there is a lot of excitement in the healthcare community about using these tools in postmarket monitoring, or surveillance, to track metrics like safety monitoring and efficacy . Although many of these surveillance techniques in healthcare are still in the early stages, security researchers in the tech world are understandably cautious . Put simply: personalized medicine holds great promise for humanity, but it is not possible to have personalized medicine without some amount of 'surveillance' - indeed, they go hand in hand . Similar data have been used to create 'health risk scores' for the opioid crisis, determining who gets access to what types of care . Matwyshyn argues that using the human body as a technology platform raises a number of legal and policy questions for which regulators and judges need to prepare . Our healthcare system has strong protections for how to store and share a patient's biological specimens, such as a blood or genomic sample - but what about our digital specimens? With the increase in biometric surveillance from these tools, data rights and governance - who gets access to what data and when - become critical . End user license agreements and terms of service, which gain consent one time on sign-up, are not sufficient as a method to actually inform a person about how their health data - in the form of a digital specimen - will be protected . Security and compliance . Any organization that works with personally identifiable information, personal health information and direct access to patients is at a high risk for cyber threats . Today, with the rise of connected products, even a few vulnerable lines of code can have a profound impact on human life . Healthcare has seen a proliferation of vulnerabilities, particularly in connected technologies, many of which are life-critical: for example, Johnson and Johnson's insulin pumps, St Jude Medical's implantable cardiac devices, and the WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected 200 000 computers, many of which were part of a critical hospital . Vulnerabilities in connected technologies can be exposed by either black hat or white hat hackers . White hat hackers, also referred to as security researchers, perform a style of ethical hacking on mission-critical networks and will employ the policies of coordinated disclosure to the network owner if vulnerabilities are found . Risk prioritization protocols . A number of organizations have created protocols to prioritize risk levels of known vulnerabilities . For instance, MITRE, a non-profit that operates research and development centers sponsored by the federal government, created the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, to identify and catalog vulnerabilities in software or firmware into a free 'dictionary' for organizations to improve their security . Major agencies that are addressing healthcare cybersecurity include the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which has published a number of well-documented methods for quantitatively and qualitatively assessing cyber risks, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has released a number of both premarket and postmarket guidances on cybersecurity best practices . Implementing protection policies . Researchers and developers should not count on others to implement critical basic protections; they should have knowledge of their organization's policies and important contacts, such as the chief information security officer (CISO) . Software bill of materials . The Hippocratic Oath for Connected Medical Devices . As monitoring and surveillance tools become mainstream, it is critical to have secure and ethical checks and balances . As connected tools increasingly augment clinicians, a critical question emerges: should the manufacturers and adopters of these connected technologies be governed by the symbolic spirit of the Hippocratic Oath? . Inspired by this idea, a number of security researchers from I Am The Cavalry, a grassroots organization with ties to DEF CON, an underground hacking conference, drafted 'The Hippocratic Oath for Connected Medical Devices' (HOCMD) . This outlines a number of security and ethical principles, including 'secure by design' and 'resilience and containment' . 24 The FDA has supported further collaboration between security researchers and connected device manufacturers through the agency-led #WeHeartHackers initiative, which launched in early 2019 . The Mayo Clinic set up a model hospital environment where security researchers were able to be in an immersive hospital setting and executed a number of security challenges simulating a real environment . Many government agencies support initiatives to improve security for medical connected technologies and healthcare delivery organizations . For instance, Health and Human Services (HHS) sponsors the Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) joint Cybersecurity Working Group (CWG) . ","As advances in technology enable digital tools to gather ever larger amounts of high-resolution personal health information, core principles of medical and research ethics must be integrated at every step, beginning in the design phase. The line between 'personalization' and 'surveillance' is thin. As a result, and given the near impossibility to 'de-identify' mass amounts of data, it becomes more and more important to know who has access to sensitive data and under what conditions. Common practices in the consumer technology industry for obtaining agreement to corporate terms of service, including privacy policies, are not sufficient or appropriate for obtaining informed consent from users, be they patients receiving care or participants in health research. (When was the last time you read an end user license agreement for a website or app you use?) The field of digital medicine must develop innovative ways of ensuring that the values of respect, privacy and trust are not lost in the pursuit of better data. It is critical to ensure that the technologies are worthy of the trust we place in them."
9781905832729,ch_9,"Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary passage of urine during sleep in children aged 5 years old and above . Primary nocturnal enuresis is urinary incontinence that occurs during sleep in a child who has never regularly been dry at night . It is often referred to as 'bed-wetting' and is a common condition that can cause difficulty for both child and family . The majority of children affected are fully continent during the day . The condition is usually self-limiting and children generally become dry at night spontaneously as they get older . Nocturnal enuresis has a number of different etiologies (Table 8.1) . If nocturnal enuresis persists beyond 9 years of age, the child should undergo an evaluation . A comprehensive urologic history should be taken to exclude any associated conditions that may require treatment . The specific gravity of an early-morning urine sample should be measured to identify those who may benefit from antidiuretic hormone (ADH; desmopressin) treatment . vi and Figure 2.3) is one of the most important tools in the investigation and management of primary nocturnal enuresis . It will provide detailed information about fluid intake and voided volumes during the day and episodes of bed-wetting during the night . It can be used to assess the severity of the problem and also provides a baseline against which the effects of treatment can be measured . Urodynamic studies should be reserved for the child with diurnal symptoms that fail to respond to conventional treatments . Many different treatments have been tried for nocturnal enuresis, with varying degrees of success . The success rates of common treatments are shown in Table 8.2 . The majority of children will grow out of bed-wetting, and reassurance may be all that is necessary . However, most parents and children ask for treatment because of the inconvenience and social difficulty that bed-wetting causes . Changes in fluid intake and therefore output are the simplest means of improving the condition; keeping a diary is important to record improvements . It is important not to set a high and unattainable goal too early or the child will lose interest . If the child wets the bed at a particular time of night, a waking regimen may be of benefit . Behavioral therapy and biofeedback are useful non-pharmacological treatments . Pharmacological treatment . However, it can be useful if a child is sleeping away from home . Only 1% of adolescents (by age 15 years) still experience nocturnal enuresis, and 15% of these become dry with each subsequent year . Occult neurological dysfunction may be responsible for enuresis in a small number of patients . After the age of 18 years, patients with persistent enuresis due to detrusor overactivity that does not respond to non-surgical treatment could be offered treatment with botulinum toxin or bladder augmentation (see 4 . Nocturia and nocturnal polyuria . Nocturia is defined as waking from sleep once or more to void . Nocturnal polyuria is a contributory factor in up to 83% of patients with nocturia . Overactive bladder is estimated to be a contributing factor in 17-33%, and the incidence of nocturia in patients with overactive bladder is estimated to range from 50-80% . vi and Figure 2.3) is the most useful tool for investigating nocturia: it will provide information about the number of night-time voids and fluid intake, particularly in the evening and night . Treatment of nocturia should be on the basis of identified underlying causes . Simple measures can be implemented, such as reducing evening and nighttime fluid intake . Treatment of sleep apnea can improve nocturia . Pharmacological treatment aims to shift the diuresis to the daytime . ADH (desmopressin) has been used successfully to reduce nocturnal urine output . If treatment is commenced, it is important to measure serum electrolytes beforehand and 1-3 days after commencing treatment, as hyponatremia can develop rapidly . A trial of antimuscarinic agent (see Table 4.3) is likely to be beneficial only if the nocturia is associated with significant nocturnal detrusor overactivity . Having a patient take the drug at bedtime may help to decrease nocturia . Nocturnal symptoms . ","Primary nocturnal enuresis is urinary incontinence that occurs at night in a child who has never been regularly dry at night. It is a relatively common condition, but generally resolves spontaneously and rarely persists into adolescence. The frequency/volume bladder record is the most useful investigative tool for primary nocturnal enuresis and also helps in monitoring treatment. Treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis is rarely required, but can include modification of fluid intake, behavioral treatments and occasional use of ADH (desmopressin). Nocturia - defined as waking from sleep to void - has a significant impact on quality of life and is a major cause of falls in the elderly. Treatment of nocturia is largely on the basis of the underlying cause. Loop diuretics in the afternoon may be useful if nocturia is related to congestive heart failure. ADH should be used with caution, as it can cause rapid hyponatremia. Antimuscarinics may prove useful only in patients with severe nocturnal detrusor overactivity."
9781912776276,chp3,"Different reports have cited different brain regions . Cognition is the most significant risk factor for psychosis in drug-treated patients . People with PD also develop the same age-associated problems as their peers, id est macular degeneration and glaucoma . Although hearing loss is common in the age group of most patients with PD, there have been no reports of an association with auditory hallucinations . This does not mean there is no association . It has been implicated as a risk factor for PDP, particularly for visual hallucinations . The peculiar feature of this risk association is that RBD may pre-date the development of PD motor features by decades, without the development of any psychotic symptoms, hence its presence is likely to signify other parallel processes . One report described transient delirium with psychosis in 7 of 22 patients with PD who underwent DBS-STN . In another study, 28% of patients who underwent DBS-STN developed psychosis in the 5 years after implantation . The genetic aspects of non-motor symptoms in PD are only just beginning to be investigated, hampered by the fact that most patients with PD are not genetically tested . Of those that have had genetic screening, only a small percentage have been found to have a gene related to PD . Thus, the reports on genetic PD have large gaps in their data . Common gene mutations . The most common genes found to be related to PD so far are the LRRK2 and GBA genes . Like all genes, these have different frequencies in different populations . However, there are over 100 different LRRK2 mutations associated with PD . The most common is the Gly2019Ser variant, which is associated with 2% of patients with PD in the USA, about 5% of patients with PD in general, about 20% of Ashkenazi Jewish patients and about 40% of people of North African Berber Arab descent . LRRK2 mutations are associated with a lower likelihood of psychosis than mutations in the GBA gene (see below) . GBA mutations may also be associated with the development of dementia and psychosis: the risk of dementia was found to be increased eightfold and the risk for psychosis threefold compared with non- GBA mutation carriers . As dementia is also an independent risk factor for psychosis in people with PD, it is not clear if the gene is a primary or secondary risk factor for psychosis . Rare gene mutations . Several rare gene mutations have been identified in patients with PD, some of which have been associated with psychotic syndromes . SNCA mutations are associated with a greater prevalence of psychotic symptoms than in non-genetic PD . About 25-33% of reported cases have psychotic features . Cases of psychosis in patients with PD who have PINK1 mutations are rarely reported . Serotonin genes . However, one small study did not find any association between either of these polymorphisms and psychosis in people with PD in the absence of dementia . An international group identified 45 patients with the microdeletion 22q11.2 who met clinical criteria for a diagnosis of PD . An additional 21% developed psychotic symptoms after treatment with PD medications, but the distinction between PDP and schizophrenia was not made . No autopsy confirmation of PD could be found . Two sisters with onset of PD at age 20 were found to have a mutation in the PLA2G6 (PARK14) gene . Prior to PD they had normal cognition, with psychosis typical of PDP developing on treatment of motor symptoms [Klein 2016, personal observation] . Other case reports also describe patients with young-onset PD and psychosis with this genetic abnormality, which is usually associated with neuroaxonal dystrophy . Most studies have found no correlation between the APOE gene and PDP . Conflicting associations with PDP have been reported for the MAPT gene . The major risk factor for PDP is medication (Table 3.2) . All the medications that treat the motor symptoms of PD are associated with hallucinations, delusions and delirium . Many patients with PD use marijuana derivatives for a wide spectrum of symptoms, including sleep problems, pain, tremor and anxiety . Psychosis in untreated patients . Rarely, patients with PD who have never received any PD medications have reported hallucinations, but this is uncommon . When the psychosis develops early, it is difficult to know if it is PDP occurring without medication or DLB . Tapering medications . ","The medications commonly prescribed to people with PD can exacerbate or trigger psychosis, particularly visual hallucinations. For this reason, medications should always be reviewed in people developing PD psychosis (PDP). Cumulative anticholinergic load may be important in people on multiple medications. Impaired visual acuity or concurrent eye conditions may increase the risk of visual hallucinations and should be addressed. The study of genetic relationships with PDP is in its infancy and most genetic associations are not yet known. LRRK2, the most common monogenic cause of PD, generally confers a more benign prognosis than GBA -associated PD. People with PD and GBA mutations are at increased risk of dementia and psychosis."
9781912776153,chp8,"Atrial flutter is usually defined as a macro-entrant atrial rhythm (id est a circuit that covers a large area of the atrial myocardium), rotating counterclockwise, occasionally clockwise, within the right atrium (see Figure 1.9) . Typical atrial flutter is defined as cavotricuspid isthmus- (CTI) dependent, whereas atypical flutter includes all other atrial flutters . A QRS rate of exactly 150 bpm should raise suspicion of atrial flutter . The diagnosis of typical or atypical atrial flutter is usually made by reviewing the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing the flutter waves . Other than atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter is the most common arrhythmia seen by cardiologists . Patients who have AF may initially present with typical atrial flutter, and only later develop AF . In typical atrial flutter, the circuit is critically dependent on the CTI, an area of slow conduction in the right atrium (see Figure 1.9) . Other types of atrial flutter, referred to as atypical atrial flutter, occur mostly in patients with scarring in the atrium (exempli gratia after radiofrequency ablation or previous heart surgery, or those with structural heart disease) . Atrial flutter characteristically has a saw-tooth appearance of flutter waves on the baseline in the 12-lead ECG (see Figure 1.9) . In common counterclockwise atrial flutter the P waves are inverted in the inferior ECG leads II, III and aVF . In clockwise atrial flutter (less common) the re-entry loop cycles in the opposite direction and thus the flutter waves are upright in II, III and aVF . Atypical atrial flutter includes all other types of atrial flutter on the 12-lead ECG . Clinical presentation . Atrial flutter can be asymptomatic or may present with palpitations, breathlessness, tiredness or frank heart failure . Pharmacological treatment . A class Ic antiarrhythmic agent such as flecainide or propafenone is generally contraindicated in patients with atrial flutter because of concern about slowing the atrial rate with these potent Ic agents, which slow conduction, and, paradoxically, may allow the ventricular rate to increase . In some cases, the atrial rate may be reduced from 300 bpm to 200 bpm and may allow the atrioventricular node to conduct in a 1:1 fashion, producing a paradoxical increase in the ventricular rate to 200 bpm, which may be associated with hemodynamic compromise . Oral sotalol is often used in patients with atrial flutter as it has the combined action of an antiarrhythmic and a beta-blocker, but QT considerations and renal excretion limit its use in women and the elderly . In the chronic setting, atrial flutter often responds poorly to drug therapy . Atrioventricular nodal-blocking drugs slow the ventricular response . Direct-current cardioversion is highly effective for atrial flutter, requiring generally lower energies than for AF . The same safety features for performing cardioversion for AF apply equally to atrial flutter, mainly consisting of patients being anticoagulated before cardioversion, as well as properly synchronizing the direct-current shock to the R wave . This enables safe cardioversion . After cardioversion, anticoagulation should be continued . Anticoagulation is generally advised for at least one month after cardioversion . Radiofrequency (catheter) ablation is recommended as the treatment of choice for CTI-dependent atrial flutter . The procedure can be performed during constant atrial flutter or in sinus rhythm with pacing from the atrium or coronary sinus . Most centers are now performing ablation as first-line treatment . After ablation, the prognosis for patients with typical CTI-dependent atrial flutter is excellent . In patients with atypical atrial flutter, recurrences are more common because of scarring of the atria . Up to 30% of patients with either type of atrial flutter develop AF late after a successful flutter ablation and may require further treatment; atrial flutter and AF often coexist . ","Ablation for typical atrial flutter is highly successful and low risk, and should be considered first-line treatment. The risk of systemic embolization in atrial flutter should be considered similar to that for atrial fibrillation (AF). Atypical atrial flutter usually includes right atrial flutter circling around regions of scarring, or left atrial flutter following ablation of AF."

9781912776818,hh-3,"Immune-mediated TTP . The reported annual incidence is 6 per million (UK TTP Registry) and 1.74 per million (Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry) . Individuals with iTTP tend to be young women; the median age is 43 years and there is a female predominance of 73% . The major ethnic groups affected by TTP in the UK are white (64%) and African-Caribbean (27%) . The etiology of most iTTP is primarily idiopathic (76%); secondary precipitants include infection, associated autoimmune disease, pregnancy, HIV and, rarely, drugs . Congenital TTP is also an ultra-rare disorder with, in the last 15 years, 73 confirmed cases described in the UK TTP Registry . An additional 123 cases have been identified in the international Hereditary TTP Registry . Individuals from Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa have been enrolled in the international Hereditary TTP Registry, with first disease recognition recorded between birth and 70 years . The Registry has detected 98 different ADAMTS13 mutations (see below) . Immune-mediated TTP results from an acquired deficiency of a cleaving protease for von Willebrand factor (VWF),, now identified as ADAMTS13 . This severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 function can result in the accumulation of ultra-large VWF (UL-VWF) in the plasma, which tethers platelets and results in platelet-rich thrombi within the endothelial surface of the microcirculation (Figure 1.2) . The mechanism of ADAMTS13 deficiency is autoimmune, with autoantibodies (typically immunoglobulin [Ig]G) targeting ADAMTS13 . Antibodies can target different domains of ADAMTS13, but most people have antibodies that bind epitopes in the N-terminal domain . The main mechanism by which autoantibodies contribute to ADAMTS13 deficiency is thought to be direct inhibition of ADAMTS13, but increased clearance of ADAMTS13 also contributes . In contrast to iTTP, the mechanism of ADAMTS13 deficiency in cTTP is through mutations within the ADAMTS13 gene itself . ADAMTS13 is located on chromosome 9q34, containing 29 exons and encompassing 1427 amino acids . The mutations are autosomal recessive, with individuals being either homozygous for a mutation (36%) or a compound heterozygote (64%); the main disease-causing mutations are frameshift, missense and nonsense . Mutations have been reported throughout the ADAMTS13 gene . Importantly, in cTTP there is no functional inhibitor of the ADAMTS13 protease . There are typically two peaks seen in clinical presentation: one in childhood, with a median age of 3.5 years; and one in adulthood, which is typically related to pregnancy (median age 31 years) - in individuals who present in adulthood, 69% of cases are associated with pregnancy . The type of mutation identified has been shown to differ between age groups, with pre-spacer domain mutations (see Figure 1.1) leading to earlier symptom development in childhood . The most commonly reported mutation in the UK is rs142572218 (exon 24 R1060W missense mutation), which typically has a later onset of presentation . The international Hereditary TTP Registry found the most common mutation to be rs387906343 (exon 29, c.4143_4144dupA, p .

","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) exists as immune-mediated (autoimmune) and congenital forms. TTP is mediated by a deficiency of ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor, causing multisystem microthrombi. Congenital TTP has two incidence peaks, first in childhood and then in adulthood, typically in pregnancy."
9781908541703,ch_4,"Breast cancer is an enigmatic disease . Women who do not start menses, seldom get breast cancer . Breast cancer stage appears to be a biological property of the tumor rather than simply an expression of anatomic spread . The natural history of breast cancer is determined by the stage at diagnosis; thus, the risk of recurrence of a stage II tumor is inherently higher than that of a stage I tumor . When breast cancer recurs, it can show a variety of presentations, depending on the time to relapse and the site of recurrence . Occasionally, the disease is explosive in both time and distribution, mimicking an infectious process . Breast biology . To appreciate the significance of the observations outlined above, it is helpful to consider the development of the human breast and breast cancer as a biological process . Malignant change . It is, perhaps, a truism to suggest that breast cancer is the result of a subtle imbalance in the complex regulatory cycles to which breast tissue is exposed . It is the combination of such 'host' and tumor factors that will determine the clinical pattern of the disease . The incidence of breast cancer is age related perhaps because multiple defects are involved; the clinical stage and pattern of disease are functions of these defects . Moreover, cancer as a process extends beyond the cancer cell . Breast cancer is fundamentally different (Figure 3.4) . The risk of recurrence, on a proportionate basis, remains constant for life and is determined by the initial stage of the tumor . Moreover, periods of increased recurrence risk 2-3 years after diagnosis have been observed . The treatment guidelines presented in Fast Facts: Breast Cancer have been derived from a classic model of the disease, which is now evolving rapidly . Structure of the breast and surrounding tissues . The breast is composed of glandular and adipose tissue in varying proportions . The blood supply to the breast has two main components . Benign breast disease . Although a lump is the first symptom in 80-90% of cases of breast cancer, about 80% of lumps are due to benign breast disease (Table 3.1) . Solitary cysts are among the most common benign breast tumors in women aged 35-55 years . Fibroadenomas account for 13% of all breast tumors and are most common in women under 30 years of age, in whom they account for 60% of palpable lumps . Smaller tumors do not need to be excised in women under 35 years of age if the diagnosis has been confirmed by cytology . Breast cancer . Most malignant breast tumors originate in the epithelia of the terminal ducts and lobules; only a small number involve the stroma or soft tissues . Histologically, breast cancers are characterized by groups of abnormal cells in a matrix of normal fibrous tissue . Highly differentiated tumors (grade I, score 3-5) are associated with a better prognosis than poorly differentiated tumors (grade III, score 8-9) . Ductal carcinomas account for over 90% of breast cancers . Lobular carcinomas account for approximately 8% of breast cancers . Such tumors may occur at several sites, either in the same breast or in both breasts . The physical signs and characteristics of lobular cancers may be similar to those of ductal cancer . Low-grade tumors may be treated in the same manner as fibroadenomas, and high-grade tumors in the same way as sarcoma with radical excision . Natural history of breast cancer . Furthermore, despite apparently successful treatment, women can relapse and die up to 20-30 years after the initial diagnosis . Nomenclature of breast cancer . The traditional adjective used to describe breast cancer - 'invasive' - is a tautology and is unnecessary . Accurate clinical staging for breast cancer has always been considered essential as a guide to prognosis and treatment . Current methods of clinical staging . Oddly, most staging systems do not take into account any surrogate marker for growth rate of the primary tumor and it is not used for making clinical decisions . cancer-math . When should staging investigations be performed? Patients diagnosed with early operable breast cancer should not have investigations to see if the cancer has spread . All national and international guidelines recommend against routine staging for T1-2 and N0-1 disease . It is reasonable to describe the natural history of breast cancer in terms of growth, invasion and metastatic potential . ","Breast cancer is becoming understood as a constantly evolving series of defects in cellular regulation and control. Growth, invasion and metastasis are related but distinct regulatory processes. The mix determines the clinical course in an individual. Most breast lumps are benign, especially those in women younger than 50 years of age. Staging of breast cancer, including examination of lymph nodes, is a prognosis-estimating procedure. Axillary surgery is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic as it achieves local control. New evidence is emerging that the systemic response to the trauma of surgery may induce angiogenesis at the site of latent/occult distant metastases. This may well be amenable to perioperative manipulation of the tumor microenvironment. Gene array techniques are bringing modern molecular biology into the clinic."
9783318068207,hh-3,"DNA bases . Human DNA comprises about 3 billion bases . Nucleotides and DNA structure . A gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the creation of a gene product, either RNA or protein . Genes are built up of DNA . Some genes act as instructions to make proteins . However, many genes do not code for proteins . In humans, genes can differ in size ranging from a few hundred DNA bases to more than 2 million bases . Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is utilized to synthesize a functional gene product . Non-coding DNA . Only about 1% of DNA is made up of protein-coding genes; the other 99% is non-coding . Although non-coding DNA does not provide instructions for making proteins, it is essential to the function of cells, particularly the control of gene activity . Non-coding DNA contains sequences that work as regulatory elements, determining when and where genes are turned on and off . Such elements provide sites for specialized proteins called transcription factors to bind and either activate or repress the process by which the information from genes is turned into proteins during transcription . These processes are very relevant in cancer genetics . Promoters provide binding sites for the protein machinery that carries out transcription . Enhancers provide binding sites for proteins that help activate transcription . Silencers provide binding sites for proteins that repress transcription . Insulators provide binding sites for proteins that control transcription in several ways . Barrier insulators prevent structural changes in the DNA that would otherwise repress gene activity . Other regions of non-coding DNA encode specific types of RNA molecules . The cell cycle . In the first G phase, G1, the cell grows and proteins and RNA are synthesized . The centromere contains specific types of DNA, which are tandem repetitive sequences (satellite DNA) . MtDNA contains 37 genes, all of which are essential for normal mitochondrial function . The remaining genes provide instructions for the development of tRNA and rRNA, which primarily help assemble amino acids into functioning proteins . Gene mutations . A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene . Gene mutations have variable effects on human health, depending on where the mutations occur and whether they modify the primary function of essential proteins . A missense mutation is a change in one DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein made by the gene . A nonsense mutation is also a change in one DNA base pair . An insertion changes the number of DNA bases in a gene by adding a piece of DNA . As a result, the protein made by the gene may not function properly . A deletion changes the number of DNA bases by removing a piece of DNA . Small deletions may remove one or a few base pairs within a gene, while larger deletions can remove an entire gene or several neighboring genes . The deletion may alter the function of the resulting protein or proteins . A frameshift mutation occurs when the addition or loss of DNA bases changes a gene's reading frame . The resulting protein is usually non-functional . This type of mutation may alter the function of the resulting protein . This type of mutation can cause the resulting protein to function inadequately . Point mutations have a variety of effects on the downstream protein product . Point mutations in multiple tumor suppressor proteins cause cancer . Genomic alterations in cancer . Base substitutions/single-nucleotide variants are the simplest type of gene-level mutation . These are prevalent in many types of cancer . Many cancers exhibit chromosomal rearrangements . Oncogenic mutations . Tumor suppressor genes . TP53 is the gene that codes for cellular tumor protein p53 . Tumor protein p53 regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair and metabolism changes . Other examples of tumor suppressor genes include the retinoblastoma gene, RB, and PTEN . An agnostic biomarker is present across many tumor types . ctDNA is tumor-derived fragmented DNA in the bloodstream that is not associated with cells . Liquid biopsies detect tumor cells or tumor cell products that are released from metastatic sites or the primary tumor . ","DNA carries the genetic code in the form of sequences of codons; each codon codes for a specific amino acid or a stop signal. Non-coding DNA, which is much more abundant than coding DNA (99% versus 1%), has important functional roles; promoters, silencers, enhancers and insulators are examples of regulatory elements of non-coding DNA. Different types of genetic mutation occur. A mutation may result in the production of a protein with altered functional ability, or it may prevent the protein from being produced. The most frequent genetic alterations associated with cancer include: base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and rearrangements. TP53 mutations are the most frequent mutations in patients with cancer. Mutations affect the ability of cellular tumor protein p53 to regulate cell division and survival. Mutations affecting the MAPK signaling pathway are also implicated in cancers. Dysregulation of the pathway results in increased cell division and survival."
9781908541468,ch_10,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease . Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is a common inherited multisystem disease in which patients develop multiple bilateral kidney cysts, cysts in other organs and non-cystic renal manifestations (Figure 8.1) . Most patients (85-90%) have a mutation in the PKD1 gene, which encodes the protein polycystin . Mutations in a second gene, PKD2, can also cause APKD . Cysts arise from focal dilatation of the tubules . Clinical features of APKD are summarized in Table 8.1 . APKD affects about 1 in 1000 people, making it one of the commonest inherited diseases . It is a common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, progression is slow in most patients, and not inevitable . Cysts are easily identified by ultrasound examination . Cysts are not commonly seen in the fetus or in children . They are, however, found in a number of conditions other than APKD, such as simple cysts, tuberous sclerosis and von Hippel-Lindau disease . Genetic diagnosis by mutation analysis or linkage analysis is possible, but not always available, and may require blood samples from family members . Cyst hemorrhage is usually self limiting . Upper tract infection should be treated with antibiotics that will penetrate cysts (fluoroquinolones) . Stones are managed as in patients without APKD (see Chapter 10) . Liver cysts occasionally need resecting . Hereditary nephritis (Alport's syndrome) . Hereditary nephritis is a group of rare genetic disorders that affects 2 in 100 000 people, and accounts for 3% of children and 0.2% of adults with ESKD in developed countries . It is caused by mutations in type IV collagen, which result in structurally defective glomerular (and other) basement membranes . Hereditary nephritis presents with hematuria and proteinuria, causes deafness and ocular changes, and in some individuals progresses to chronic kidney failure (CKD), but with a wide variation in phenotype . There are three genetic forms of hereditary nephritis . mutations in the COL4A5 gene causing X-linked Alport's syndrome (80% of patients) . mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4 causing autosomal-recessive disease (15% of patients) . mutations causing autosomal-dominant inheritance (5% of cases) . Hematuria may be observed at birth . The absence of hematuria during the first 10 years of life makes it likely that a child will not be affected . About 50% of patients are deaf, males being more commonly affected than females . Deafness is usually progressive from birth onwards; in its early stages, the hearing deficit is detectable only by audiometry . The most common ocular abnormalities are anterior lenticonus and/or pigment abnormalities of the macula . In lenticonus, the central portion of the lens protrudes into the anterior chamber, which causes progressive opacification of the lens leading to loss of visual acuity and progressive myopia . Lenticonus is usually associated with deafness and appears during the second to third decade of life . The differential diagnosis of hereditary nephritis includes various primary and secondary glomerular diseases causing hematuria, especially thin basement membrane disease and immunoglobulin (Ig)A nephropathy, and abnormalities of the urinary tract . However, the clinical usefulness of molecular genetic analysis is limited; it is time consuming and expensive and only identifies 50% of mutations . Recent work shows that some patients with thin basement membrane lesions have a heterozygous deficiency of either alpha3 or alpha4 type IV collagen chains . Although usually benign, some families show slow progression to CKD . Ultimately, many patients progress to ESKD, requiring dialysis or transplantation . Transplant survival rates are similar to those for patients with other diagnoses (see Chapter 12) . Anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis involving the kidney allograft may occur in a recipient with hereditary nephritis, because an immune response develops to a hitherto unseen type IV collagen antigen; however, this is rare and affects only 3-4% of male transplant recipients . ","Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited disease. Liver cysts are the most common extrarenal manifestation. Progression to end-stage kidney disease is slow, and does not occur in all patients. Alport's syndrome is an important but rare cause of hematuria. Deafness and eye abnormalities are common in men with Alport's syndrome."

Gene expression studies show a similar gene expression pattern to Tfh cells, a distinct CD4 + T-cell subset, suggesting that this is the cell of origin in AITL . Malignant T cells may represent only a minor component of the infiltrate, so accurate diagnosis can be challenging . The morphology of AITL can overlap with reactive entities and other lymphoid malignancies such as classic Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell-rich large B-cell lymphoma . B cells infected with EBV may resemble Reed-Sternberg cells, potentially causing confusion with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (Figure 2.4) . Molecular characteristics .

Indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract is extremely rare . It usually expresses CD8, although CD4 and NK cell markers may be seen rarely . Molecular characteristics . ","The PTCLs are a group of highly heterogeneous aggressive malignancies that arise from the transformation of mature post-thymic T cells and natural killer cells. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies PTCLs into nodal, extranodal and leukemia types, each with multiple disease entities. PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) is the most common subtype, reflecting the need for more precise characterization of these lymphomas. Genetic analyses are helping to refine this category further. The primary nodal PTCLs are anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), which may be positive or negative for the fusion protein anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK + /ALK − ), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Extranodal PTCLs are less common than nodal PTCLs and include enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL). Classification has been largely based on morphologic assessment, although the 2016 update to the WHO classification incorporated recent advances in the understanding of the cell of origin and the molecular signatures of particular types of PTCL. Genetic lesions are also being identified but few are entity-defining markers."
9781910797631,chp5,"The biological differences between women and men, particularly in regard to reproductive function, have often been considered to be the principal explanation for this higher rate of depression . The status of women in society, their social roles and the economic disparity between women and men are the main sociocultural factors that contribute to the higher rate of depression among women . The assessment of depression in women needs to take into account the sociocultural and personal factors that may be contributing to the onset, and more importantly the maintenance, of depression . These need to be addressed to allow depressive symptoms to respond to treatment . Perinatal depression . It is a time when women are at particular risk of developing depression and also experience a high risk (30-40%) of having a postpartum relapse of bipolar disorder . For many women this will be accompanied by significant financial stress . Depression in pregnancy or antenatal depression . Prevalence and risks . Until recently, little attention had been paid to depression arising during pregnancy as it was thought that most episodes of depression arise postpartum . However, we now know that 6.5-12.9% of women will experience antenatal depression, emanating either from a pre-existing depressive episode or a new-onset episode . Women who are depressed in pregnancy are more at risk of having a preterm delivery, and a baby of low birth or small for gestational age; they also have an increased risk of gestational hypertension . However, it remains to be seen what type and severity of depression can have such adverse outcomes . This has led some to recommend that women should be screened for depression over the perinatal period, and in some countries, screening programs have been implemented using questionnaires such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale or the Patient Health Questionnaire to identify women who may have depression . Identification of depression during pregnancy is important, but a detailed assessment is required to clarify whether depression is indeed present . Many women can have transient symptoms of depression over the perinatal period and overpathologizing them can be as harmful as missing a diagnosis of depression, as it may lead to the application of unnecessary interventions . The clinical assessment of depression in pregnancy needs to take into account the fact that some 'depressive' symptoms can arise from physical symptoms associated with pregnancy, such as fatigue, insomnia, appetite and weight change, and loss of libido . Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe option for pregnant women with severe and unremitting depression . The management of depression over the perinatal period is much the same as the management of depression at other times . Care must be taken with women who may already be taking an antidepressant at the time of conception . Abruptly stopping the medication can lead to a depressive relapse and the medication may need to be restarted . However, in some cases it may be the initial presenting symptom of postnatal depression . Postnatal depression . This is an episode of depression that develops within the first year after childbirth, a similar clinical picture to depression at other times in life . Depressed mothers may be insensitive to their infants and can interact poorly with them . As with depression during pregnancy, a stepwise approach is taken to the diagnosis and management of postnatal depression, comprising . It is estimated that postnatal depression is not recognized or adequately treated in about half of women with the condition . Once the depression has been identified, the woman should be invited to talk openly about her problems . Psychological treatment . Pharmacological treatment can be considered for women with more severe postnatal depression . Women with severe depression may require admission to a specialized mother and baby unit, especially when there are concerns about the safety of the mother and the infant . Suicidal ideation should be checked with new mothers, particularly those with severe depression . Some women with severe postnatal depression, especially if they are agitated or have psychotic symptoms, may require ECT . Up to 5% of women will have regular episodes of depression in relation to their menstrual cycle, most likely the result of sensitivity to changing hormonal levels . If this strategy is adopted, care should be taken to remind women about the potential risks should they fall pregnant . Perimenopausal depression . Depressive symptoms as well as episodes of depression can commonly emerge during the menopausal transition . When women present with perimenopausal symptoms, it is worthwhile asking about their mood as well as reviewing the physical symptoms . The addition of hormone replacement therapy to the antidepressant may be sufficient to overcome the depressive episode . ","Depression is about twice as common among women as men as a result of sociocultural, psychological and biological factors. Women are at particular risk of developing depression during the perinatal period - the time from conception through to the end of the first postnatal year. Antenatal depression is a predictor of subsequent postnatal depression. There are risks associated with the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy. Only small amounts of the SSRIs pass into breast milk, and breastfeeding is considered safe. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder affects up to 5% of women; its assessment requires the presence of symptoms over a number of menstrual cycles. Some women do not respond to antidepressants during the perimenopause, and the addition of hormone replacement therapy to an antidepressant may help."
9781908541727,ch06,"Gritty, itchy or watery eyes are very common complaints, and in general are annoying to the patient rather than dangerous . Routine referral is appropriate for patients with gritty, itchy or watery eyes if their discomfort persists or worsens . Patients with these symptoms do not require urgent referral, unless you discover another abnormality when taking a history or during examination . Gritty eyes or foreign body sensation . Causes of a gritty eye include a corneal or conjunctival foreign body, corneal ulcers (infective and non-infective corneal ulcers, such as marginal keratitis), corneal abrasions, dry eye, blepharitis, inturned eyelashes, ectropion and entropion . The most common causes of gritty sore eyes are dry eye and blepharitis or a combination of the two . Foreign body in the eye . If a patient complains 'there is something in my eye' (foreign body sensation), they may well have a foreign body on the cornea (see Chapter 11) or conjunctiva, or between the upper or lower eyelid and the eyeball . If a foreign body is not visible, remember to evert the upper and lower lid (see Chapter 1) and look for a foreign body under the lid . Corneal ulcer . Causes may be infective (viral, bacterial, fungal or protozoan) or non-infective . These patients require urgent (same day) referral to an ophthalmologist . Be aware that a dendritic corneal ulcer, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), may present as a gritty eye rather than a red painful eye, because the virus makes the cornea partially numb . Dry eye may cause a slightly red eye, or the patient may have normal-looking eyes . Corneal abnormalities caused by dry eye are only visible on slit-lamp examination . Dry eye should be suspected if the patient complains that their eyes feel 'dry' or 'burning', or if the sensation worsens during reading (due to the decreased blink rate we all have while reading) . If the eyes are uncomfortable or 'stuck down' on waking, a lubricating ointment at night as well as drops during the day can help . Patients commonly complain of chronic eye irritation, grittiness and itching . Patients with blepharitis are also predisposed to the development of chalazia (eyelid lumps caused by inflammation of the oil glands; see page 85) and marginal keratitis (small peripheral corneal ulcers) . Blepharitis is often associated with dry eye . Patients with blepharitis may have an anterior component with crusting of the base of the lashes ('dandruff' of the lashes) but also a posterior component called meibomianitis, an abnormality of the oil component of the tear film . This poor oil layer allows the watery component to evaporate, resulting in a dry eye . This is why patients can sometimes have watery eyes even though the problem is one of dry eye from blepharitis - the poor oil layer allows the watery layer to evaporate quickly, which stimulates excess lacrimal secretions and more aqueous production and hence the watery eye . You must warn the patient that these measures may take several months before they start to alleviate the symptoms and may need to be continued indefinitely . Refer routinely if there is no improvement . However, patients with recurrent inturned lashes should be referred for more permanent treatment . Eye irritation occurs in ectropion because the outward drooping lid exposes the eye and can also cause watering, while in entropion the inturned lid's lashes abrade the cornea . The symptoms of entropion tend to be more severe due to the lashes rubbing the eye . Itchy eyes . Eye itch without redness is most commonly due to allergic conjunctivitis; however, mild itching may also be caused by dry eye or blepharitis . Watery eyes (epiphora) . The patient complains of constant or intermittent 'tears in the eyes', which sometimes stream down the cheeks and require frequent eye wiping, without eye redness, pain or irritation . In adults, watery eyes are usually due to age-related blockage of the tear ducts or to ectropion, both of which can be corrected with surgery . ","Most patients with gritty, itchy or watery eyes do not need urgent referral, unless serious abnormalities are found when taking a history or on examination. You can treat many patients with these conditions yourself, as described in the chapter. It is important to use a blue light and fluorescein drops to examine the cornea to exclude a corneal ulcer. Occasionally a viral dendritic corneal ulcer will present with a gritty or irritated eye (no pain is felt because the virus makes the eye numb). Always refer these patients urgently to an ophthalmologist and do not prescribe steroid eye drops. Remember to evert the upper eyelid in patients complaining of a 'gritty' feeling or foreign body sensation, to look for a foreign body under the lid."
9781908541468,ch_12,"There are four main types of kidney stones (Table 10.1) . The most common stones contain calcium salts, and may be calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate or a mixture of both . Magnesium ammonium phosphate stones (struvite stones) mostly occur in association with an underlying urease-splitting bacterial infection of the urinary tract (exempli gratia Proteus) . These stones often recur and are most often seen in patients with an associated anatomic abnormality . Pure uric acid stones usually occur in the context of hyperuricemia among patients with a gouty diathesis or a hematologic malignancy . Uric acid stones have a high recurrence rate . Rarely, drugs can crystallize in the urine and form stones (exempli gratia indinavir, triamterene, aciclovir) . Reduced levels or absence of urinary inhibitors of stone formation, such as citrate, also favor stone formation . Calcium stone disease . The most common stones are calcium oxalate stones rather than pure calcium phosphate . The major cause of calcium stone formation is excessive urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria), with or without hypercalcemia . The most common cause of hypercalcemia is primary hyperparathyroidism . Hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia is observed in 60% of patients with calcium stones . Non-calcareous stone disease . The most common type of non-calcareous stones are struvite stones, which are also termed 'infection' stones, because they are usually associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) by a urea-splitting organism . Uric acid stone formation is also critically dependent on the urinary pH . A urinary pH lower than the dissociation constant for uric acid (pH 5.5) and/or the presence of hyperuricosuria play major roles in uric acid stone formation . Clinical presentation varies depending on the location, size and number of stones . The most common presentation is renal colic, which is the sudden onset of severe pain caused by the presence of an obstructing kidney or ureteral stone . On the other hand, larger stones may present with painless obstruction or back pain . Stones that reach the ureterovesical junction often present with renal colic accompanied by urgency and frequency . Stones located in the kidney calyces may be completely asymptomatic . Patients with renal colic are often writhing in excruciating pain and restless . An elevated BUN and creatinine would suggest dehydration and/or the presence of an obstructing stone in a patient with a single kidney, or bilateral obstructing stones . Hematuria and pyuria are usually present . Assessment of urine pH is critical, because acid urine with a radiolucent stone suggests a uric acid stone, while an alkaline urine (pH > 8.0) suggests infection with a urease-splitting organism (exempli gratia Proteus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella) . Initially, management is directed towards optimal pain control, hydration and urologic consultation for potential removal of an obstructing stone, and subsequently to the underlying predisposing factors and prevention of further episodes . Medical management of a non-obstructing stone requires increasing fluid intake to generate a urine output of more than 2 liters/day, dietary modification and treatment targeted at changing urinary pH (Tables 10.4 and 10.5) . Low-calcium diets are to be avoided . Surgical management depends on the size, location and number of stones (Table 10.6) . stones more than 5 mm in diameter . stones impacted for more than 24 hours . evidence of significant obstruction . evidence of infection . Obstruction may require percutaneous nephrostomy . Surgical options include extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and stone removal (percutaneous or transurethral) . Rules of thumb are that cystine and calcium oxalate monohydrate stones are generally poorly broken up by ESWL, while calcium oxalate, struvite and uric acid stones are usually amenable to ESWL, as well as to removal by either the percutaneous or transurethral route, depending on the size and location of the stones . ","Kidney stones are common and are most often associated with hypercalciuria. Stones can be asymptomatic or cause a variety of clinical problems. Stones may require surgical intervention, but recurrence after surgery is common. High fluid intake and a low-salt and low-oxalate diet are the mainstays of management. Low-calcium diets should be avoided. Thiazide diuretics and potassium citrate are used in some patients."
9781910797495,chp12,"Acute headache . The immediate, important first step in assessing a new headache is determining whether the headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical event requiring emergency evaluation and management . All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and discarded before considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition . Chronic headache . As with all chronic pain, headache must be assessed systematically and classified according to its likely origin as well as its temporal pattern, aggravating and ameliorating factors and perpetuating factors and comorbidities . The headache diagnoses in Table 12.2 should be considered . The history should note, as for any other pain, a general medical history, including a detailed pain history (Table 12.3) . As emotional factors often trigger tension or migraine headache, psychosocial assessment for the relationship of stressful events to headache onset and extant stressors or psychiatric comorbidities will be important for risk management and treatment planning . Recent literature has tended to blur what were once thought to be clear distinctions between headaches without a clear anatomic generator, such as tension headache compared with migraine headache . Further activation of the trigeminal nucleus leads to the characteristic signs of central sensitization usually associated with the clinical picture of full-blown migraine, during which almost any sensory stimulus will worsen the headache . These signs and symptoms include allodynia over the face and head, photophobia and sensitivity to noise or movement, causing patients to want to lie down in a dark, completely quiet room until the headache passes . There appears to be a genetic predisposition to migraine in some patients . These headaches can themselves activate a migraine headache in some patients . Transform headache, often called rebound headache, is caused when the pain-suppressing effects of a short-acting sedative, anxiolytic and/or analgesic wear off so that the manifestations of the sensitized state of the central nervous system (CNS) resumes, often leading to daily headache . Hence caution against the regular, daily or almost daily use of these drugs for headache control is advised . Sinus headache is caused by allergy- or infection-induced sinus inflammation with subsequent blockage and increased pressure . Stress is the most common trigger of both migraine ( around 75%) and tension headache, and like all persistent or recurrent pain, the headaches themselves and their effects on function and quality of life can be stressful to patients, their families and their associates . As with all pain syndromes, the cycle of pain-stress-pain-dysfunction-stress-pain etc . in headache should be identified, and treatments targeted to each of the predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors to whatever degree is possible . For example, palpation over the occipital nerve can precipitate the pain of occipital neuralgia and trigger points in the neck and trapezius can radiate rostrally causing headache . Diagnostic tests . The treatment approach for migraine is best conceptualized as longitudinal chronic disease management in three parts: preventive measures, abortive treatment and symptom management . This approach is based on understanding the phenomenological pattern of each individual's headache, as in Figure 12.1 . Psychotherapies, such as support/directive and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), may help patients manage a complex interaction of factors that perpetuate headache . Tension headache . Management of episodic tension-type headaches starts with understanding the precipitants of the headaches . This is best accomplished by a headache diary in which the patient records all headaches and their contexts, either in a small notebook, on headache diary sheets or in a personal digital assistant (PDA) . For stress-induced headache, a stress management program, usually delivered in CBT, that trains the patient to avoid and/or manage precipitating stressors and to relax and stretch at onset of headache . For positional headache, such as that activated by poor ergonomics at a computer terminal, positional and seating changes, stretching routines and icing can be helpful . At the onset of headache, modulation techniques are initiated, such as stretching and icing, and relaxation techniques . Occipital neuralgia . Pressure over occipital nerves or nerve injury due to trauma or surgery may activate headache symptoms . Nerve block may eliminate headache symptoms temporarily or for extended periods . Myofascial headache . Treatment includes awareness and avoidance of triggers, such as posture and stress . ","In patients without history of chronic headaches, determine whether an acute new headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition. In chronic headache:- use a headache diary to differentiate headache type and establish pattern of triggers to enable self-management strategies- institute preventive measures such as trigger avoidance, stress control and medication- institute abortive regimen appropriate for headache type- migraine: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress control, triptans- tension/myofascial: NSAIDs, stress control, icing, stretching- avoid regular frequent analgesic use to reduce incidence of transform (rebound) headache physical dependency."
9781908541666,ch_12,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes . DKA occurs more often in adults than in children, but it can occur at any age . Most commonly seen in young adults, it is the main cause of death in type 1 diabetic patients under the age of 20 years . DKA may also be encountered in people with type 2 diabetes, particularly in those of Afro-Caribbean descent . When DKA occurs in type 2 diabetes, it is the physiological stress caused by the underlying illness that precipitates the acute metabolic decompensation . DKA consists of the biochemical triad of ketonemia, hyperglycemia and acidemia . DKA may occasionally be the presenting manifestation of type 1 diabetes or, more often in patients with established diabetes, it is the consequence of many precipitating factors, of which the most common is infection (accounting for 30-50% of cases; Table 11.1) . Of the infective causes, urinary tract infection and pneumonia predominate . Other common medical conditions such as myocardial infarction, acute stroke, pancreatitis and trauma may precipitate DKA . Newly diagnosed, previously unknown type 1 diabetes causes about 15% of cases . Often, psychological factors are implicated if there has been deliberate insulin omission or non-compliance with insulin therapeutic regimens . Frequent recurrent DKA in one individual is a commonly encountered clinical scenario - it is usually the consequence of a psychosocial problem that may be very difficult to delineate . The incidence of DKA is slightly greater in females than in males . Recurrent DKA in young women is frequently caused by insulin omission . However, no definite cause is found in a large proportion of cases of DKA . Clinical presentation . Hyperglycemia results principally from increased hepatic glucose production with a contribution from increased renal glucose production and decreased glucose uptake into peripheral tissues . In addition to the physical signs that may reflect the underlying condition causing DKA, there will be signs of dehydration including tachycardia and hypotension . Biochemical tests will confirm the diagnosis of DKA (hyperglycemia, ketonemia, ketonuria and acidosis) . Patients with DKA may have leukocytosis in the absence of infection . Patients with initial hypokalemia are considered to have severe serious total body potassium depletion . Immediate treatment of any identifiable cause of the DKA should be undertaken without delay . Until recently, standard management of DKA focused on reducing blood glucose levels with insulin and intravenous fluids . There is still universal agreement that the initial cornerstone of treatment is fluid replacement and insulin administration . The aim is to replace total body deficits of water and electrolytes, with half the estimated deficit being replaced in 12-24 hours (see Table 11.3) . In parallel with this, it is recommended that insulin 'sliding scales' are replaced with a weight-based fixed rate insulin infusion of 0.1 units of insulin/kg bodyweight . Insulin therapy and correction of acidosis decreases potassium levels, and most patients will require intravenous potassium supplementation to prevent hypokalemia and replace total body potassium deficit . The prognosis of DKA is usually determined by the precipitating cause . Cerebral edema is a rare life-threatening complication usually encountered in children with DKA (around 1% of episodes) . Treatment is with intravenous mannitol . When a patient presents with DKA, every effort should be made to identify the cause where possible in order to establish strategies to prevent a recurrence . Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state . It is less common than DKA, but carries a higher mortality rate (10-20%) . HHS usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (often undiagnosed) . HHS occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes in the presence of a concomitant illness that leads to reduced fluid intake . Infection (commonly urinary tract infection and pneumonia) is the preceding illness in 30-60% of cases . Clinical presentation . Typically, patients have symptoms of diabetes and weakness . Patients are clinically severely volume-depleted and often there are signs of infection when this is the precipitating cause . Treatment of HHS by fluid, electrolyte and insulin replacement is as for DKA (fluid deficits may be large [exempli gratia 10 L or more]) . ","Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and acidosis. Infection is the most common precipitating factor in DKA. Treatment of DKA is by fluid and electrolyte replacement, intravenous insulin and treatment of the underlying cause, when known. The overall mortality of DKA is 3-4%. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) occurs in older patients with type 2 diabetes. HHS is similar to DKA, but without ketosis and acidosis. Treatment of HHS is similar to the treatment of DKA."
9781912776818,hh-6,"TTP was originally characterized by a pentad of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, fluctuating neurological signs, renal impairment and fever . However, advances in our understanding have demonstrated that TTP can present without the full pentad . The diagnosis is confirmed by an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL . Typical laboratory findings . The median platelet count is typically 10-30 x 10 /L at presentation . Significant renal impairment usually points to a diagnosis of HUS . It is a sign of poor prognosis, being associated with a sevenfold increase in mortality rate compared with TTP patients with normal troponin levels . CT or MRI of the brain should be considered in these patients, but it is important that imaging on admission should not interrupt plasma exchange therapy . Precipitating cause . Investigations should also be tailored toward looking for a precipitating cause . If clinically indicated, blood, urine and stool cultures should be sent to exclude infection . A stool culture can rule out an important differential diagnosis, infection-associated HUS, which is typically associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and may present with bloody diarrhea, TMA and marked renal impairment . Unlike TTP, management is usually supportive rather than with plasma exchange . Other precipitating causes to be excluded are autoimmune disorders and pregnancy . A virology screen should be undertaken prior to exposure to plasma products, to exclude HIV and other viral-associated TTP . Confirming the diagnosis . Once a diagnosis of TTP is suspected, treatment with plasma exchange should be initiated without delay . ADAMTS13 activity . ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL confirms the diagnosis of TTP . Samples taken immediately following plasma therapy may give a falsely elevated ADAMTS13 activity . However, it has been shown that in more than 78% of cases, samples taken after 3 days of plasma exchange still had an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL . The presence of an inhibitor on mixing studies or anti-ADAMTS13 IgG may help to confirm the diagnosis of iTTP in these situations . Other TMAs, by definition, will not have an ADAMTS13 activity below 10 IU/dL or the presence of significant anti-ADAMTS13 IgG . A persistent deficiency (< 10 IU/dL) of ADAMTS13 activity, with no evidence of inhibitory autoantibodies, suggests a diagnosis of cTTP . Individuals can present in the neonatal period, childhood or adulthood, with presentation typically associated with a trigger, such as infection, vaccination or pregnancy . Immune-mediated TTP can be categorized according to the presence (secondary iTTP) or absence (primary iTTP) of a precipitating factor . Both groups are defined by ADAMTS13 activity below 10 IU/dL and the presence of ADAMTS13 autoantibodies . Both also require immediate therapy with plasma exchange and steroids . Primary iTTP accounts for approximately two-thirds of iTTP cases . Treatment of secondary iTTP can be tailored toward the underlying precipitant: for example, discontinuation of the implicated drug or highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) in HIV-associated TTP . Screening for severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . A number of scoring systems have been developed to help predict the likelihood of severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity and differentiate TTP from other TMAs . In conjunction with clinical assessment, it calculates the risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and therefore allows early rapid screening of patients who can benefit from plasma-based therapy . 0-4: low risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . 5: intermediate risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . 6-7: high risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . Although a creatinine level above 150-200 µmol/L (1.70-2.25 mg/dL) and a platelet count above 30 x 10 /L usually exclude a diagnosis of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency,, there are a minority of people with TTP who present with platelet counts above 30 x 10 /L or marked renal impairment . Basing therapy decisions on these cut-offs alone runs the risk of potentially missing these atypical presentations . Therefore, the diagnosis of TTP should be definitively confirmed by analysis of ADAMTS13 activity . ","Untreated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is associated with a high mortality rate; TTP should be treated as a medical emergency. Plasma exchange should be started without delay in an individual presenting with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in the absence of any other identifiable cause. Immune-mediated TTP is often associated with organ involvement, typically neurological and cardiac. Both are markers of poor prognosis and may identify higher-risk patients. Precipitating factors, such as HIV, autoimmune disease, drugs and pregnancy, should be excluded. Treatment should be tailored toward the underlying cause. Pretreatment samples should be sent for ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels. Plasma exchange should be started immediately afterward. Diagnosis of TTP is defined by an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL. A level of 10 IU/dL or higher is in keeping with atypical (complement-mediated) hemolytic uremic syndrome and other thrombotic microangiopathies. Immune-mediated TTP is confirmed with elevated anti-ADAMTS13 IgG, whereas these antibodies are absent in congenital TTP. Scoring systems such as PLASMIC can be a useful tool for predicting the likelihood of severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity, especially in settings where ADAMTS13 assays are not readily available. However, wherever possible, definitive confirmation of TTP should be based on analysis of ADAMTS13 activity."
9781908541420,ch_7,"Current therapies, particularly inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, have excellent efficacy in controlling symptoms and preventing asthma exacerbations in nearly all people with asthma . In studies of asthma in the community, asthma symptoms are frequently poorly controlled, but this is most usually due to lack of availability of, or failure to take, recommended asthma controller therapies . However, not all patients achieve complete control of symptoms . For instance in a dose-escalation study using fluticasone dipropionate and salmeterol, only 72% of individuals achieved complete control of symptoms with high-dose inhaled therapy, although most of these had partially controlled asthma symptoms . However, some individuals with asthma suffer from severe symptoms or may have progressive loss of lung function, together with frequent exacerbations despite optimal inhaled therapy . These individuals are considered to have refractory asthma . Community studies of asthma severity suggest that approximately 5% of asthma sufferers have severe asthma and continue to suffer from uncontrolled asthma despite treatment . This group truly represent 'refractory' asthma and will fall into step 5 of the GINA treatment guidelines . International collaborative efforts are currently under way to study these individuals as they represent the major burden of asthma with respect to costs associated with emergency medical visits, hospitalizations and medications . In considering whether a patient has 'refractory asthma' it is important not to escalate treatment without careful consideration of whether it is warranted . Three questions should be asked prior to diagnosing refractory asthma . Is the patient receiving their medication? . Does the patient really have asthma? . Does the patient have severe asthma? . Is the patient receiving the medication? . Many obstacles exist to patients receiving and taking their medication . The degree to which a patient takes a medication as prescribed is termed 'adherence' and is an important goal of treatment for chronic diseases . It is estimated that fewer than 50% of individuals with an illness take medication exactly as prescribed . Asthma medication may be difficult to obtain for reasons of cost or inconvenience . Asthma places a considerable burden on individuals and appears to be more common, and more severe, in lower income groups . The personal cost of asthma in terms of lost vocational opportunities, lost days at work and illness can be very significant and impair an individual's capacity to access and afford medical care . In some instances the financial burden of regular medication can exceed a patient's ability to pay for it . Patients can then decide not to take, or 'ration' asthma medication so that they receive less than was prescribed . Non-adherence to medication can therefore be intentional due to economic reasons and other concerns surrounding medication use . Patients perform a 'cost-benefit' analysis as to whether to take prescribed medication, an analysis that includes their beliefs about the benefits of the treatment, its cost to them and the likely outcome of their asthma, and their fears about side effects (Figure 5.1) . This can be an excellent role for an asthma health educator . People with asthma may also suffer from comorbidities that render it more difficult for them to acquire and take medication . Once medication is prescribed and acquired, patients then need to use their device effectively . A major part of consultation with a patient who is not successful in achieving good asthma control should be a review of inhaler use and technique, as this can be a significant barrier to effective treatment . Routinely, the substitution of a spacer device with an MDI can improve medication delivery and consequently asthma control . So the first step in uncontrolled or poorly controlled asthma is the assessment of medication use and adherence . Patients often present with fevers, cough and sputum as well as worsening asthma . Any patient who does not respond to moderate doses of inhaled medication should undergo lung function testing to confirm a diagnosis of asthma . Does the patient have severe asthma? . A very few patients have severe asthma that continues to be unstable despite demonstrated reliable medication use . Such people should be referred to specialist care . These patients will often have abnormal lung function and also suffer from frequent exacerbations . In this instance frequent continuous use of oral corticosteroids may be employed to achieve and maintain asthma control . Other monoclonal antibody therapies have efficacy in refractory asthma and may also be employed, although their use is currently restricted to clinical trials (see Chapter 9) . The presence of severe, refractory asthma is an indication for establishment of airway inflammatory phenotype . ",Refractory asthma is characterized by uncontrolled symptoms and/or frequent exacerbations despite maximal inhaled medication including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Refractory asthma is present in less than 5% of people with asthma. The first step in assessing refractory asthma is to assess adherence to current treatment. Before making a diagnosis of refractory asthma other conditions such as COPD and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis should be excluded. Assessment of airway inflammation is a very useful step for guiding treatment in refractory asthma.
9781910797457,chp3,"The past decade has seen a significant downward shift in the stage at presentation of prostate cancer in most countries . Clinical symptoms . Patients with prostate cancer may present with a variety of symptoms (Table 3.7), many of which overlap with those of BPH . Localized cancer is generally asymptomatic . Men most often present with symptoms of BPH that are unrelated to the cancer . The possibility of prostate cancer should therefore be considered in the investigation of prostatitis-like symptoms . In rare cases, prostate cancer may extend into the corpora cavernosa . The most common presenting symptoms are shown in Table 3.8 . Early detection . In general, the earlier prostate cancer is detected, the better the outlook in terms of cure or arresting cancer progression . An increasing majority of patients present simply with an isolated increase in PSA . Causes of PSA elevation in the absence of prostate cancer are given in Table 3.3 . A study of prostate cancer prevention, in which all men in the placebo group underwent biopsy, reported a significant incidence of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels between 0.5 and 4 ng/mL and normal DRE (Table 3.4) . Many men with mildly elevated PSA levels have benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) rather than prostate cancer, however, so it is clear that PSA is not a perfect test . Several concepts have been developed to improve the clinical value of the test in the detection of early prostate cancer . A PSA density above 0.15 ng/mL has been shown to increase the specificity of the PSA test . A velocity above 0.75 ng/mL/year has been used to predict the presence of prostate cancer . However, recent studies have shown that the average PSA velocity in men without prostate cancer is 0.03 ng/mL/year, compared with 0.4 ng/mL/year in men ultimately diagnosed with prostate cancer . Age-specific reference ranges are predicated on the increase in serum PSA level with age . Studies show that patients with BPH but not prostate cancer have a higher amount of free PSA, whereas men with prostate cancer appear to have a greater amount of PSA complexed with alpha -antichymotrypsin . Prostate Health Index . This test has performed better than conventional PSA and free PSA for predicting overall and high-grade cancer in a number of studies . PCA3 (Prostate CAncer gene 3) is a piece of non-coding RNA that is only present in the prostate . The value of PSA screening in men who are asymptomatic for prostate cancer is still highly controversial (Table 3.6) . Non-randomized data show that, since the advent of PSA screening in the USA and Europe, the proportion of men presenting with advanced prostate cancer has decreased, as has prostate cancer mortality . In one randomized study, men with clinically significant prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy had a 56% reduction in the risk of premature death from prostate cancer compared with conservative management . Disadvantages to screening include the following . A large proportion of men who have a biopsy do not harbor prostate cancer, and biopsies have associated morbidity because of the risk of post-biopsy infection . The screening process may generate anxiety . The treatment of prostate cancer is associated with significant morbidity . Decisions about screening should be individualized for men younger than 55 years who have risk factors for prostate cancer (see page 8) . Early results from two large randomized studies and longer-term results from a third randomized study have been reported . The larger European study (the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC]) randomized men to screening at 4-yearly intervals or no screening . This study reported a 27% reduction in prostate cancer mortality at a median follow-up of 9 years . Prostate cancer mortality was reduced by 44% in those randomized to screening . In men who actually attended screening, prostate cancer mortality was reduced by 56% . However, there have also been reports that the cancer volume on biopsy and grade of cancers are increasing . In the future, it seems likely that screening will be focused on men who are genetically most susceptible to prostate cancer . More than 100 'prostate cancer susceptibility genes' have been discovered . Men who are at risk because of mutations in these genes could be targeted for screening . ","Increasingly, prostate cancer is being diagnosed on the basis of a raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and subsequent investigation. PSA-based screening of asymptomatic men is controversial. A baseline PSA at age 40-55 years may assess a man's future risk of developing prostate cancer. More advanced disease can present with symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction, hematuria or ureteric obstruction. Bone metastases may cause bone pain or pathological fracture."
9781908541420,ch_9,"Preventing asthma attacks is the most effective means of controlling asthma . Effective prevention involves identifying and avoiding risk factors and asthma triggers, together with effective patient education and adherence to a medication regimen . Patient partnerships . Included in the goals of good asthma management is the need to meet patients' goals and expectations as well as those of the health practitioners . Good asthma management means that a partnership should be established between the patient and health professional, with shared treatment goals noted in a jointly written and agreed self-management plan . This eases the pressure on healthcare personnel resources by helping patients to take responsibility for their health and improves asthma outcomes . Identifying the risk factors that trigger asthma attacks and removing the appropriate allergens and irritants from the patient's environment can reduce the frequency of symptoms and hospitalizations for asthma, and the need for medication . However, allergens should only be avoided when there is evidence that the patient is indeed allergic to that specific allergen . Animal allergens . A pet in the home to which the patient with asthma is allergic is a major risk factor for current asthma symptoms . Cockroach allergen is a major cause of asthma in some areas, particularly in inner city environments . If pesticide sprays are used, however, the patient should not be present while spraying is in progress, and the home should be aired thoroughly before the patient returns . Early identification of occupational sensitizers and removal of the patient from further exposure are important elements in the management of occupational asthma . Patients with both asthma and severe food allergies causing anaphylaxis are at particular risk of severe attacks and death . intolerance is an important cause of worsening asthma in adults . Treatment of rhinitis . Rhinitis is more common than asthma, and international surveys reveal that its prevalence appears to be increasing . It is increasingly evident that effective treatment of rhinitis can assist in the management of asthma . Topical nasal corticosteroid therapy for rhinitis in those with concurrent asthma in addition to regular controller asthma therapy can nearly halve the risk of asthma exacerbations requiring emergency treatment . Allergen immunotherapy can also be an effective treatment for severe or refractory allergic rhinitis, and an associated improvement in asthma outcomes has been shown . Specific immunotherapy, aimed at treating the underlying allergy, has been shown to be effective in patients with asthma caused by house dust mite, grass or other pollens, and animal dander . Such treatment may be useful in patients for whom allergen avoidance is not possible or whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional medication, or where a single allergen is especially problematic . There is some evidence that immunotherapy can prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis to asthma . Asthma management plans . Education is essential to enable patients to make the decisions needed to control their asthma . Plans should be written down so patients can refer to them (Figures 7.1 and 7.2) . A zone system, which classifies the level of asthma control according to symptoms and PEF (if available), is a useful feature of management plans . This approach helps patients to understand the chronic and variable nature of asthma, monitor their condition, identify signs of deteriorating control and take appropriate action . Moving to a lower treatment step can be considered if the patient remains in this zone for at least 3 months . Asthma symptoms are present at rest and may interfere with activity; PEF is below 60% of personal best . Patients' asthma will not be controlled effectively if they do not adhere to their medication and management plan, yet adherence studies reveal that fewer than 50% of patients take their medication as prescribed . Other reasons why patients choose not to take a medication may be unrelated to the medication (Table 7.3) . Regular consultations are necessary to give patients an opportunity to talk about their concerns, needs and expectations in relation to their asthma and its treatment . the patient's use of the controller (preventer) and reliever inhalers, PEF meter or other devices . avoidance of triggers . This includes an assessment of asthma control, including . nocturnal symptoms . the effect of symptoms on normal activity . Trained asthma educators may also be used to help patients acquire knowledge about their asthma and to address concerns that prevent use of controller medications . There is evidence that asthma education can improve outcomes of patients admitted to hospital with asthma . In general, most patients with mild or moderate asthma can be adequately managed in the primary care setting . ","Preventing asthma attacks is the most effective means of controlling asthma. Identifying risk factors that trigger asthma attacks and removing allergens and irritants from the patient's environment can reduce the frequency of symptoms and hospitalizations for asthma, and decrease the need for medication. Immunotherapy is helpful in some patients when one of the following applies: - specific allergens can be shown to be causative - allergen avoidance is not possible - symptoms are not controlled by conventional medication. A written self-management plan empowers patients to manage their asthma optimally. Failure to respond to treatment may result from non-adherence to the prescribed treatment. Attention must be paid to the patient's ability to take their inhaled therapy correctly. Identifying problems surrounding care and creating a patient partnership with agreed treatment goals can facilitate adherence."
9781908541420,ch_4,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide . The prevalence of asthma also depends on the age, geographic region and socioeconomic status of the population studied, and the study design . Several large international trials have studied asthma prevalence in adults and children . In this study, the prevalence of asthma in populations of children aged 13-14 years and 6-7 years is, on average, 13.7% and 11.6%, respectively . Studies have consistently shown that the prevalence of asthma increased worldwide through the 1980s and 1990s . However, in countries with a very high prevalence of asthma historically, particularly English-speaking countries, the rates have stabilized or are even falling . The prevalence of asthma in adults has not been the subject of such widespread global initiatives as the investigation of asthma in children . Within a particular country, the prevalence of asthma may differ markedly between different racial and ethnic groups . Asthma appears to be more prevalent in urbanized countries; the reasons are not clear, but may include . Death rates from asthma are usually reported for the under 35s, as the report of an asthma-related death in this age group is relatively reliable (Figure 2.3) . In older age groups the reported mortality from asthma can be inflated because of comorbidities, such as COPD . Wide variation in case-fatality rates is seen worldwide (Figure 2.4), which may reflect differences in both the availability and the delivery of effective asthma care and medication to individuals with symptomatic asthma . Asthma death rates not only vary between nations but have also fluctuated over time . In many countries, a marked increase in asthma deaths occurred in the 1960s, after which mortality decreased . Asthma in older people has also become a recent focus of attention . With the gradual reduction in asthma mortality in younger age groups, people over the age of 55 years are now the group who most commonly die of asthma - particularly in higher income nations . In this group, there is uncertainty as to a correct diagnosis of asthma or COPD; further research will be required to determine the extent of asthma in older people and effective therapies for this group . In addition to being an important cause of death, asthma causes substantial morbidity and interference with everyday activities . Insights into the extent of asthma-related morbidity come from surveys examining the severity of asthma symptoms . This study also revealed that in every region, around 30% of individuals with asthma presented for emergency medical care for their asthma annually . Further evidence of the morbidity of asthma comes from studies of hospital admissions for asthma . These show marked geographical variations in large part influenced both by asthma prevalence and the healthcare delivery system in place . the increasing prevalence of asthma . Early-life origins of asthma . Recent studies suggest that it does not . Natural history of asthma . Asthma can occur at any time in life, although it most commonly develops in infancy and childhood . Allergy, particularly to house-dust mites, is the most common feature associated with the development of asthma during childhood . By the age of 8 years, a significant proportion of children develop bronchial hyperresponsiveness and symptoms of moderate-to-severe asthma, whereas others continue to show mild intermittent asthma . Lung growth is relatively normal in most children with mild asthma, but may be reduced in children with severe persistent symptoms . Furthermore, lung function often remains impaired even when clinical signs of asthma have disappeared, and 5-10% of children with mild asthma develop severe asthma later in life . There is evidence that eczema is a major risk for the persistence of childhood asthma into adult life . Prevalence studies reveal that asthma is generally more common in boys until puberty, when more girls develop asthma and the predominance reverses . Some individuals acquire asthma in their adolescent years . As the prevalence of asthma in adults is generally lower than in children, it is evident that many children grow out of childhood asthma . Those whose asthma remits tend to have less severe and persistent asthma in childhood . Asthma acquired in childhood is more likely to remit than asthma acquired in either adolescence or adulthood . It is not known what proportion of patients who develop asthma in adulthood actually had a history of childhood asthma - abnormal lung function or bronchial hyperresponsiveness persists in many patients whose symptoms disappear during childhood . The natural history of late-onset asthma is variable . Such older people with asthma have increasingly become the focus of attention as the mortality and symptom burden of this group is high and response to controller therapy more variable . ","Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. The highest prevalence is seen in affluent westernized populations. In many countries asthma, along with other allergic disorders, continues to increase in prevalence, especially in children and young adults. Death from asthma reflects poor access to healthcare in many countries. Asthma can occur at any time in life, although it most commonly develops in infancy and childhood. There is evidence that early life events, including those that occur in the womb, may be important in the initiation of childhood asthma in those genetically at risk. Although asthma disappears in 30-50% of children during puberty, it often recurs in adulthood. There is no evidence that regular use of corticosteroids in early life alters the natural history of asthma, though these medications are highly effective in disease control."
9781910797082,ch07,"There are several important factors to consider before starting systemic therapy (Table 7.1) . Patient education is also important before embarking on any form of systemic therapy, particularly as all available treatments are associated with potential short- and long-term side effects . Various agents are used in the systemic treatment of psoriasis (Table 7.2) . Therefore, the risks of systemic therapy need to be carefully considered . Many patients in the USA are routinely assessed for HIV status before systemic therapy, including receptor-targeted therapies (see Chapter 8) . Methotrexate has been used to treat psoriasis for over 40 years and remains the gold standard . Before starting methotrexate therapy, it is essential to perform . renal function tests . In those at particular risk (exempli gratia the elderly), the test dose should be reduced to 2.5 mg . If the result is satisfactory, the initial dose regimen for methotrexate is 10-15 mg/week . In patients responsive to methotrexate (up to 50%), an initial improvement is often noted after 4 weeks of therapy, with continued gradual improvement over the next 8-12 weeks . It is important not to discontinue methotrexate therapy abruptly because of the likelihood of destabilizing the psoriasis, which can lead to inflammatory flares . Most patients will require a dose of 7.5-15 mg/week for continued control . Rotation with other therapies may improve long-term remissions and reduce potential hepatotoxicity . Methotrexate is contraindicated in patients who . This includes interactions with . Side effects, such as fatigue, nausea and vomiting, are usually seen within 4-48 hours of dosing . Another less frequently noted side effect is methotrexate-induced pneumonitis . Systemic retinoids . As with methotrexate therapy, when a reasonable improvement has been achieved, the dose can be reduced slowly . Side effects . Although not as effective as methotrexate, acitretin has fewer side effects . Careful management is required, including dose reduction, specific diet and, if necessary, appropriate drug therapy . This is perhaps of particular concern given recent epidemiological evidence that patients with severe psoriasis are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease . Ciclosporin was first reported as therapy for psoriasis in 1979 . Ciclosporin, which was approved for the treatment of psoriasis in the UK in 1993 and in the USA in 1997, has proved to be an excellent therapy for widespread recalcitrant psoriasis and is well tolerated by most patients . It is probably best used as interventional therapy, with slow tapering of the dose once adequate control is obtained . Less dramatic results are seen in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, who often require 4 months of therapy for optimal improvement . Side effects . Ciclosporin should be used with caution in patients who have had more than 100 PUVA treatments, because of the increased risk of skin cancer . In addition, gingival hyperplasia and increased hair growth are not uncommon side effects with ciclosporin therapy . Hydroxycarbamide is considered to be a second-line therapy for psoriasis, as improvement is slower than with methotrexate, systemic retinoids or ciclosporin . In most patients, hydroxycarbamide clears approximately 50-60% of the psoriasis . Side effects . Major systemic side effects are much less likely than with other commonly used systemic treatments . 6-tioguanine (6-thioguanine) is a purine analog antimetabolite used to treat patients with psoriasis that has been recalcitrant to other systemic therapies . Side effects . Side effects . Receptor-targeted therapies . While standard systemic therapies (phototherapy, ciclosporin, acitretin and methotrexate) remain first-line treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe disease, the arrival of the biological therapies, either as monotherapy or in combination with standard systemic therapies, has reduced the role of less effective (unlicensed) therapies such as 6-tioguanine and hydroxycarbamide, and combination therapy . The role of receptor-targeted therapies is discussed in detail in Chapter 8 . Other systemic therapies . These include . ","Conventional systemic therapies can be extremely helpful in the short- and long-term management of psoriasis. Side effects of systemic therapies for psoriasis include myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Teratogenicity limits the use of methotrexate and acitretin. Close monitoring and adherence to guidelines are key to minimizing toxicity."
9781912776696,hh-8,"The main advantage of an interim analysis is to shorten the duration of the trial . Stopping a Phase II trial early would accelerate the drug development process . Stopping a Phase III trial early based on overwhelming evidence of efficacy would enable marketing authorization to be submitted sooner than would have been the case were the trial to run to completion . Disadvantages of interim analyses . There are several potential disadvantages of stopping trials early that must be considered at the trial design stage . Stopping rules for efficacy . Interim analyses for efficacy have stopping rules that trigger a conclusion of overwhelming efficacy for the experimental treatment . At each interim analysis, a p -value calculation compares the treatment groups for the primary endpoint . For example, there may be three p -value calculations for two interim analyses and a final analysis, each of which has the potential to be a false positive . Trials should not be stopped early for evidence of efficacy unless the evidence is overwhelming . Therefore, at the first interim analysis the adjusted significance level is 0.0006 . At the second interim analysis, the adjusted significance level is 0.014, which leaves a significance level of 0.045 for the final analysis . You will probably have recognized that the three adjusted significance levels used in the O'Brien-Fleming scheme do not add up to 0.05 . In this situation, one plus one does not equal two - the adjusted alpha levels are not additive . This is because the analyses are correlated, id est the data for the first 200 patients is a subset of the data for the first 400 patients and the data for the first 400 patients is a subset of the data for the total 600 patients . The adjusted significance levels control the overall potential for the false positive (the FWER) at 0.05 . If the p -value in the second interim analysis in Example 5.1 had been 0.02 it would have been statistically significant at a conventional significance level of 0.05 . Stopping the trial at p = 0.02 would have been a major mistake as it would have destroyed the control of the type I error and destroyed the trial in the eyes of regulators and journal editors . The trial would therefore have continued through to the final analysis (as shown in Example 5.2) . Other schemes . Under this scheme, after two interim analyses the final analysis would be conducted at alpha = 0.049 . Given that the interim analyses in Example 5.1 are correlated, the Bonferroni significance levels (0.017 for each of three analyses) would be too harsh . In fact, to have the same adjusted level at each analysis, the correct adjusted significance level would be 0.022 (and not 0.017) . However, the trial design may be organized in such a way that the analyses are not equally spaced, in which case the adjusted significance levels change . For example, it may be undesirable to consider stopping after 200 patients because this would limit the amount of safety data obtained . In this setting, the analyses are no longer equally spaced and the adjusted alpha levels would need to be recalculated to control the overall alpha level . Event-driven analyses . Stopping rules for futility . In general, a futility assessment takes place reasonably early in the trial, as stopping a study for futility potentially saves a sponsor's resources . Conditional power . Is there any point in continuing the trial? The data are nowhere near the anticipated treatment difference (HR = 0.75), and if this trend were to continue a significant p -value at the end of the trial would be highly unlikely . To judge this, the conditional power of the study is calculated . conditional power under the current trend . conditional power under the original assumption . Conditional power under the original assumption . Other futility approaches . Pros and cons of stopping for futility . The value of negative data . Premature trial cessation . Stopping a trial for futility reduces power; a trial with 30% conditional power still has a 30% chance of success, but stopping a study at that point with that conditional power diminishes the probability of a positive trial result . Some trials with low conditional power have been stopped prematurely . Indeed, the LUME-Lung 2 study in Example 5.4 is one such trial . The independent data monitoring committee . It is vitally important that interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility do not cause bias . ","Interim analyses assess the data for efficacy or for futility (or both) while the trial is ongoing and data are still accumulating. Interim analyses have predefined stopping rules for overwhelming efficacy of the experimental treatment, or futility if the experimental treatment does not appear to offer any efficacy advantage over the existing treatment (or against placebo). Multiple analyses have the potential to inflate the type I probability error (multiplicity), increasing the chances of false-positive results. The type I error rate (alpha = 0.05) must therefore be divided across the interim analyses for efficacy. In most schemes to divide the alpha, a substantial amount of the 0.05 is left for the final analysis, with the interim analyses for efficacy having very stringent significance levels. There is usually only one interim analysis for futility, relatively early in the trial. The conditional power recalculates the power of the study based on the interim data under either the current trend or the original assumption. The former assumes the data in the interim analysis reflect the truth, whereas the latter assumes the original assumption about the data is correct."
9781910797556,chp1,"Definition of treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis . There is no standard definition of refractory myasthenia gravis (MG), but studies have generally utilized the criteria shown in Table 1.1 . Prevalence and incidence . These studies have reported a wide range in incidence rates (IR) and prevalence rates (PR) . In a large meta-analysis, the estimated IR was 5.3 per million person-years with a range of 1.7 to 21.3 . The prevalence rate has been found to be 77.67 cases per million, and a range of 15-179 per million worldwide has been reported . When adequately treated, most patients with MG are able to live productive lives with few or no symptoms . A distinct subset of patients, however, have very aggressive and difficult-to-control disease . These patients, who continue to have symptoms and are at continuing risk of crisis and exacerbation because of an inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, are often referred to as having treatment-refractory MG . The exact prevalence of refractory myasthenia is unknown, but it is estimated to occur in approximately 10-15% of patients with generalized disease . In a large retrospective study by Suh et al . of 128 sequential patients seen in a large tertiary referral center, 19 (14.8%) patients were found to be treatment-refractory . The definition of refractory included those patients who could not lower their immunotherapy without clinical relapse, were not clinically controlled on their immunotherapy regimen, or experienced severe side effects from immunotherapy . This study may have overestimated the true incidence of refractory MG as it was conducted at a large tertiary clinic, where the referral population comprised patients with more active disease . In a recent study by Sudulagunta et al . 76 of 512 patients (14.8%) in referral centers in India were classified as having refractory MG - exactly the same incidence as in the study discussed above . The incidence of generalized MG has been found to have a bimodal age distribution, with a peak around 30 years of age and again at 50 years, with a steady rise in incidence thereafter . Female cases predominate in the younger age group and males in the older (Figure 1.1) . Juvenile MG is defined as disease with onset before the age of 18 years and accounts for roughly 10% of all cases of MG . In the Suh et al . study discussed above, the median age of the refractory group was 36 years versus 60 years in the non-refractory group . Refractory patients were more likely to be female (14 of 19) . In the Sudulagunta et al . study, the age of disease onset in the refractory MG group was significantly lower than in the non-refractory group (median age of 36 years versus 61 years) . The refractory group also had a higher percentage of females . In general, MG is more commonly reported in East Asia, with a higher frequency of ocular disease . There is otherwise an equal geographic distribution in the incidence and prevalence of MG in both adults and children . While all races and ethnicities are affected by MG, people of African descent have a slightly higher prevalence of the disease, which is particularly true in muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive disease . MuSK antibody-positive disease is also more commonly reported in geographic locations closer to the equator . MuSK-antibody positivity and other clinical characteristics . Suh et al . found that 47% of treatment-refractory patients were MuSK-antibody positive, compared with 2% of non-refractory patients . Despite the high percentage of patients with MuSK antibodies in the refractory group, they were also more likely to have undergone thymectomy and to have had thymoma . Sudulagunta et al . found that 36 (47.36%) of the refractory patients had MuSK antibodies . Patients in the refractory group were also more likely to have thymoma, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia . The high incidence of diabetes and dyslipidemia was thought to be secondary to the higher doses of corticosteroids used in the refractory group and highlights some of the risks associated with long-term corticosteroid treatment . ","Treatment-refractory MG is defined as disease that inadequately responds, or results in unacceptable adverse reactions, to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, or requires excessive amounts of potentially harmful agents or repeated rescue therapy. Patients with comorbidities that preclude the use of conventional treatments and/or who have frequent myasthenic crises are also considered to have refractory MG. Treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis (MG) is estimated to occur in approximately 10-15% of patients with generalized MG. Compared with non-refractory patients, treatment-refractory patients are more likely to be younger at disease onset, female, thymomatous and muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK)-antibody positive."
9781912776153,chp7,"SVTs are not usually life-threatening, although they can be in rare circumstances . SVTs usually occur in young, otherwise healthy, adults, but can be seen at any age . Thus, SVTs are relatively infrequent . The characteristic feature is usually a regular narrow QRS complex on the surface electrocardiogram during symptoms of tachycardia (Figure 7.1) . Wide-complex SVTs do occur but are less common . Termination of a narrow QRS tachycardia after intravenous administration of adenosine is often diagnostic of a tachycardia that involves the AV node (exempli gratia AVNRT) or a tachycardia mediated by an accessory pathway, but it does not exclude an atrial tachycardia . Some atrial tachycardias are adenosine sensitive and may terminate rather than reveal that the AV node is not required for the arrhythmia . Characteristically, patients complain of sudden onset of rapid palpitations . Associated symptoms are . sudden onset - sometimes the patient is aware of a brief run of ectopy before the tachycardia starts . sudden offset usually . Infrequently, more often in younger patients than in adults or the elderly, atrial tachycardia may be persistent . These patients do not always have associated symptoms of palpitations and, because of the incessant nature of the tachycardia, they may present with heart failure . Patients often develop successful ways of stopping their SVT, such as Valsalva maneuvers, deep breathing techniques, lying down or sleeping . The patient can be given the treatment options available, so that any increase in symptom frequency can be dealt with immediately . Patients with ventricular pre-excitation (as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) should be referred to a cardiologist for risk assessment, and generally most of these patients undergo catheter ablation . These maneuvers work variably - not at all in some patients - but should be tried as they are low risk and simple to perform . The safest and easiest to teach is the Valsalva maneuver, in which a patient strains against a closed glottis . Pharmacological treatment . As discussed above, these arrhythmias use an accessory pathway (atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia), or in the case of AVNRT a slow pathway, as part of the tachycardia in addition to the AV node (see Chapter 1) . Usually, antegrade depolarization of the ventricle occurs over the AV node . It has a particular action on the accessory pathway, slowing conduction and reducing its ability to sustain an arrhythmia . Flecainide should be avoided in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function or clinical heart failure, as the risk of proarrhythmia increases significantly . These risks are minimal when LV function is normal, as in the majority of patients with SVTs . The usual oral dose of flecainide is 100 mg twice daily, although occasionally 50 mg twice daily is effective . Propafenone has partial beta-blocking actions and is generally not recommended in patients with at least moderate asthma . Propafenone should be avoided in any patient with impaired LV function . The usual dosage is 150 mg two to three times daily . Sotalol also has partial beta-blocking actions and should be avoided in patients with asthma . Treatment should be started at 80 mg twice daily and increased gradually . Patients should be warned that they will experience a flush and possibly chest pain following the injection . The effect is usually quite dramatic but disappears within a few seconds . Occasionally, treatment with adenosine may reinitiate the arrhythmia, in which case longer-term suppressive therapy must be considered . Drugs to be avoided . None of these drugs alters accessory pathway function, so by blocking the AV node all conduction to the ventricles is likely to occur over the pathway . Many drugs that affect accessory pathway conduction also affect the AV node, but it is the differential effect that is important . Occasionally, patients may have such a fast tachycardia that blood pressure is compromised and urgent direct-current cardioversion may be appropriate . Anesthesia or sedation is necessary unless the patient is unconscious . The prognosis for patients with SVTs is excellent . ","Supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) refer to a reciprocating regular tachycardia involving the atrioventricular (AV) node region, an accessory pathway or a discrete atrial substrate. SVTs usually occur in young, otherwise healthy, adults, but may be seen at any age. Intervention is not usually needed if symptoms are infrequent and non-intrusive, providing a diagnosis of SVT has been confirmed. Where ventricular pre-excitation is present on electrocardiography (exempli gratia patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome), referral for cardiological assessment and risk profiling is strongly recommended. Regular antiarrhythmic therapy is not advised in asymptomatic WPW. In symptomatic patients with WPW syndrome, even if symptoms are minimal, ablation is recommended. Pharmacological treatment is aimed at slowing conduction through the AV node and/or the accessory pathway. First-line treatment is catheter ablation; in the presence of normal ventricular function, antiarrhythmic agents are also considered (flecainide, propafenone or sotalol)."
9781908541086,ch_11,"As mentioned in Chapter 1, the classification of 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' (EDNOS), the third diagnostic category of eating disorders in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), is given to cases that do not fulfill the full criteria for anorexia or bulimia, and is the most frequently given diagnosis for eating disorders . Examples of EDNOS diagnoses are . individuals who meet all the criteria for anorexia but despite significant weight loss maintain weight in the normal range . individuals who display combinations of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors but at lower frequencies than those stipulated in the criteria . EDNOS also includes two subsets of disorders that have been defined by specific diagnostic criteria and have received increasing research interest: binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES) . Binge-eating disorder, or non-purging bulimia, is characterized as recurrent episodes of binge eating, accompanied by a sense of distress, and feelings of disgust, depression or guilt, without the subsequent inappropriate compensatory behaviors (purging or non-purging) associated with bulimia . Hence, BED is often associated with overweight or obesity . There is increasing consent in the literature to consider BED as its own diagnostic category because of its distinct features, treatment and prognosis compared with bulimia . The overall prevalence of BED has been estimated as 3.5% in women and 2.0% in men . Compared with anorexia and bulimia, the sex ratio is less uneven, with males making up about 40-50% of EDNOS diagnoses with a BED subcategory . Age of onset for BED is slightly higher than for bulimia, ranging from 17 to 32 years, with a mean of 25 years . BED has an overall better prognosis than bulimia, however, as it responds to a wider range of treatments that target both binge eating and weight reduction . Although the types of treatment are the same as those used for patients with bulimia, BED is more responsive to various subtypes of treatment such as medication and CBT . CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT) have appeared equally effective in reducing binge eating, although they do not lead to clinically significant weight loss . Pharmacotherapy has used anticonvulsant agents such as topiramate, which have been associated with a reduction in both binge eating and weight . In one study, the combination of topiramate and CBT led to an abstinence rate of 80% compared with 61% for placebo . Individuals with NES wake several times throughout the night to eat, consuming over a third of their total energy intake after their evening meal . Binge eating or purging behaviors are generally not associated with this disorder, and these individuals can usually recall what they ate . In contrast, nocturnal eating/drinking syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating throughout the night with no, or partial, recollection of what was eaten . This syndrome is a combination of an eating, sleep and mood disorder . Limited research has been conducted on effective treatments for NES, but the SSRI sertraline has shown some benefit . Feeding disorders . In young children, problems with eating are called feeding disorders . These disorders are believed to reflect the relationship between parent and child, as opposed to just the child or the adolescent as is the case with eating disorders . There are three DSM-IV categories of feeding disorders: feeding disorder of infancy and early childhood; rumination disorder; and pica . Feeding disorder of infancy and early childhood is a problem with feeding such that a child does not eat properly, resulting in weight loss or inability to gain adequate weight . This problem must first present under 6 years of age to meet the diagnostic criteria . Rumination disorder is the regurgitation and rechewing of food in an infant or child and presents after a period of normal functioning . Pica is the repeated eating of non-nutritive substances such as paint, plaster, string, hair or cloth . This problem usually presents in infancy and remits in early childhood . Pica is associated with pervasive developmental disorder and mental retardation . Feeding disorder diagnoses are only given if symptoms last for at least 1 month, cannot be explained by other medical problems and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention . Treatment includes medical interventions for malnutrition and behavioral interventions to build healthy feeding patterns . Other eating disorders . ","Eating disorders not otherwise specified is the category of diagnosis given to cases that do not fulfill all DSM-IV criteria for anorexia or bulimia; subtypes of this category include binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES). There is a higher prevalence of BED than anorexia or bulimia in men. The peak age of onset for BED is somewhat later than that for bulimia, and BED has an overall better prognosis. Individuals with NES wake several times throughout the night to eat, consuming over one-third of their total energy intake after their evening meal. Feeding disorders in young children are categorized as feeding disorder of infancy and childhood, rumination disorder or pica."

The bifurcation of the hepatic duct (hilum) is the most common site for cholangiocarcinomas (Klatskin tumor) . Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type; molecular changes include the expression of mutant p53 and K-ras . The overall pathophysiology of cholangiocarcinoma is poorly understood . Cholangiocarcinoma occurs predominantly in patients aged 50-70 years and is more common in men than women . Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma are shown in Table 5.1 . The serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19.9 are usually elevated; however, they may also indicate other types of tumor, and can be mildly or moderately elevated in benign biliary obstruction . Transabdominal ultrasound indicates the level of biliary obstruction and sometimes the tumor mass itself (Figure 5.2) . A CT scan of a distal bile duct cancer will show dilation of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary systems and the gallbladder . CT scans have limited ability to determine the resectability and extent of a tumor and often need to be supplemented by additional techniques, such as positron-emission tomography (PET), to enhance their accuracy . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may provide supplementary definition of both the tumor and extent of biliary obstruction (Figure 5.3) . Other imaging modalities include endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound, which may be useful adjuncts for establishing and defining the location and extent of a tumor . The type of operation depends on the location of the tumor . A distal cholangiocarcinoma is treated with a partial duodenopancreatectomy (Whipple's procedure) . A hilar lesion may be treated by local resection but usually requires a partial hepatic resection; in either case a hepaticojejunostomy is required to restore continuity of the biliary-enteric tract . Intrahepatic lesions are treated with hepatic resection . Preoperative stenting for alleviation of biliary obstruction may avoid deterioration of liver function, but increases the risk of cholangitis and other complications following resection, especially in hilar lesions . Palliation of unresectable tumors . Stents may be plastic (removable) or expandable metallic stents (non-removable) . Randomized studies using local photodynamic or radiofrequency ablation therapy have demonstrated prolonged biliary patency and survival . Other bile duct tumors . Table 5.3 lists the various bile duct tumors . Biliary papillomatosis presents as tumorous papillary growths of the bile duct epithelium, which are usually diffuse and multiple . A possible association between Caroli's disease and biliary papillomatosis has been reported . Biliary cystadenoma is a rare tumor . Malignant degeneration does occur, but very little is known of the risk for this . Because of the risk for malignancy and recurrence, surgical treatment encompassing resection or complete enucleation is recommended . Lymphoma of the bile duct . Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may arise from the bile duct . Jaundice may occur due to a variety of causes, including direct hepatic involvement or compression of the bile ducts by lymph nodes, as well as tumor-related hemolysis . This tumor can occur between the first and seventh decades of life . Treatment is variable and includes a combination of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery . Future developments are likely to include . improved imaging for preoperative diagnosis (exempli gratia PET and EUS-FNA) . better selection of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma for liver transplantation . molecular markers for improved preoperative diagnosis, prognostication and treatment selection . bioabsorbable stents for palliation, in addition to other new and improved local treatments, such as photodynamic therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasonography, etc . improved methods for minimally invasive pain control and palliation . ","Bifurcation of the hepatic duct is the most common site for cholangiocarcinoma. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is the major risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Benign biliary obstruction may increase cancer antigen 19.9 levels. Biliary papillomatosis lesions are diffuse and multiple, with the abnormal biliary epithelium producing a large amount of mucus. Rare tumors include biliary cystadenoma and primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
9783318066241,ch2,"The incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) has increased in most regions of the world in recent decades . The incidence of a first episode of AP ranges from 15 to 45 per 100 000 population per year . Age at first episode of pancreatitis depends on the etiology: childhood for hereditary AP, fifth decade of life for alcohol-related AP and sixth to eighth decade of life for biliary AP . The overall incidence of AP is similar in men and women but alcohol-related AP is more frequent in men (70-90% of total episodes of alcohol-related AP occur in men) . Gallstones are the most frequent cause of AP in many countries . Gallbladder polyps may also be associated with AP . Pancreas divisum has been classically associated with AP, but the relationship is controversial, as the prevalence of pancreas divisum in the general population and in patients with idiopathic AP is similar . Other obstructive etiologies . Solid as well as cystic tumors of the pancreas can induce AP . Other obstructive causes of AP include periampullary duodenal diverticulum, while pancreatic duct strictures due to previous pancreatitis or trauma may induce recurrent AP and obstructive chronic pancreatitis . Other rare causes of obstructive pancreatitis are listed in Table 2.1 . Sustained heavy drinking (at least four to five drinks per day) has been associated with an increased risk of AP . No association has been found between sporadic heavy consumption of alcohol and AP . Recurrent AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis are common after a first episode of alcohol-related AP . Smoking is an important cofactor in alcohol-related AP . In the same population-based study, almost 50% of patients with alcohol-related AP were also smokers, and an alcoholic etiology and smoking were independent predictors for recurrence . Genetic factors may also predispose alcoholic patients to developing recurrent AP and facilitate progression to chronic pancreatitis . Mutations that have been associated with pancreatitis are listed in a database at www . Most described mutations associated with AP affect the digestive protease/antiprotease system . Cationic trypsinogen gene mutations . In 1996, the first genetic mutation leading to pancreatitis was described by David C . Other mutations associated with pancreatitis have been described subsequently . Patients with hereditary pancreatitis due to PRSS1 mutations have an increased risk of pancreatitis during childhood, quick progression to chronic pancreatitis and a high probability of developing pancreatic cancer . Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in CTRC result in a 2.5- to 10-fold increased risk of developing pancreatitis . Compound heterozygosis involving a mutation of both CTRC and SPINK1 has also been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis . Mutations associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress . CFTR mutation . Interestingly, mild mutations that are not associated with cystic fibrosis may be associated with pancreatitis . This reduction in flow may result in the progressive depletion of SPINK1 until autoactivation of trypsinogen ultimately causes pancreatic damage . Some patients may have interactions between mutations in CFTR, SPINK1 and /or CTRC . AP is the most frequent complication of ERCP, with an incidence of 3-4% in unselected patients . Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and fine needle aspiration of pancreatic lesions may both be associated with iatrogenic AP . HTG is the cause of AP in 2-26% of patients (mean 9%) and 14% of patients with HTG will develop AP . In China, HTG is one of the most frequent causes of AP . The triglyceride threshold for HTG-induced AP is not completely understood, and most studies have used 500-1000 mg/dL . In a meta-analysis, the weighted mean triglyceride level in HTG-induced AP was 2622 mg/dL . This etiology seems to be associated with a worse prognosis . Infectious disease . Many different microorganisms have been associated with AP (see Table 2.1), but infectious disease is a very infrequent cause of AP, explaining just anecdotal cases . AP is a common clinical presentation of autoimmune pancreatitis . In a cohort of patients from the Mayo Clinic, 58% of patients with type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis presented with AP . ","Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a frequent cause of hospital admission and its incidence has been increasing in recent decades. Gallstones are the leading cause of AP in most countries, followed by alcohol. Hypertriglyceridemia and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are also common causes. Mutation in the PRSS1 gene is a rare cause of AP, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Other genetic mutations are generally considered as cofactors in the development of AP. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma must be ruled out in patients without an evident cause of AP who are aged more than 50 years, with weight loss and/or a recent diagnosis of diabetes."
9781910797723,chp5,"Immunotherapy has already become an essential component of standard treatment for patients with advanced cancer . In advanced malignant melanoma, which was incurable in the era of chemotherapy, we are now seeing durable long-term remission in many patients with the use of combination immunotherapies, including in patients with brain metastases . As a result, combinations with other targeted immunotherapies or chemotherapy are now being extensively investigated . Clearly, a number of important issues around the use of cancer immunotherapies remain to be resolved . Who will/won't benefit from treatment . Despite the clinical breakthroughs described above, at present most patients do not respond to immunotherapy, even for an approved indication . The lack of reliable predictive biomarkers of efficacy or toxicity is perhaps the major current issue around the use of immunotherapies . A further issue with the measurement of PD-L1 levels in patients with lung cancer has been the requirement for a core biopsy . Preliminary data suggest that elevated systemic inflammatory markers may identify patients who are less likely to benefit from immunotherapy in the advanced disease setting . Further clarification of this relationship, and determination of the optimal systemic inflammatory marker, may improve patient selection and provide options for future combination therapies . Optimal combinations of immunotherapies with other anti-cancer treatments . Combination therapies with PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs and CTLA-4-targeted drugs provide greater responses and survival than monotherapies in patients with melanoma, albeit with significantly greater autoimmune toxicities . However, to date, patients with lung cancer have not tolerated the same doses as those given to patients with melanoma . These combinations are now being explored in other cancer types . Studies are under way with combinations of established immunotherapies and new agents that target other immune regulatory molecules, including activating antibodies that target agonistic immune receptors and inhibitory antibodies that target inhibitory immune receptors . It is hoped that these combinations will be efficacious in malignancies that are currently resistant to immunotherapies . Optimal use of cancer vaccines and oncolytic viruses will involve . Clearly, the optimal use of vaccines and other immunotherapies in combination with standard systemic therapies, radiotherapy and surgery needs to be established . Immunotherapies plus systemic therapies . Early data from patients with lung cancer suggest that added benefit can be obtained from the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy . It will be exciting to see if concurrent or prior use of other systemic therapies might increase mutational burden, and thereby improve the response to immunotherapies . Therapeutic exploitation of ICD in conjunction with checkpoint inhibitors is a logical next step in combination therapies . Immunotherapies plus radiation . Radiotherapy is widely used to treat patients with malignancy in a number of settings, including curative, adjuvant and palliative treatment . Radiation can induce ICD, creating the potential for synergy with immunotherapies, especially the immune checkpoint inhibitors . Clinical trials are under way to determine the optimal dose and scheduling of radiotherapy to combine with immunotherapies . Monitoring of these associations will be useful in ongoing combination studies . Optimal timing of immunotherapy interventions . To date, therapeutic antibodies that target immune checkpoint inhibitors, and immune therapies in general, have predominantly been used in the advanced disease setting, initially in patients who have received prior therapy . Similarly, the use of anti-PD-1 therapies in the neoadjuvant setting produced longer survival than adjuvant treatment, albeit without long-term survivors . A number of studies of neoadjuvant therapy in various tumor settings are under way . Some Phase III studies of adjuvant immunotherapy completed in patients with resected melanoma have demonstrated improvements in disease-free survival but long-term survival data are awaited . Optimal duration of immunotherapies . The optimal duration of treatment with immunotherapies is unknown . For PD-1 mAbs, some patients are treated indefinitely and others for up to 2 years . Prediction and management of immunotherapy toxicities . Toxicity is the greatest limitation to the use of combinations of immunotherapies . An ability to predict or completely control toxicities would greatly enhance the use of combination immunotherapies . Precision immunotherapy . In order to harness the immune system for enhanced anti-tumor response and deliver optimal immunotherapy to every patient, predictive biomarkers and novel combination treatment strategies are urgently needed . ","Predictive biomarkers are urgently needed to direct precision immunotherapy. Tumor mutation burden is a promising predictor of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors but requires further study, including the use of non-invasive tools such as plasma-circulating tumor DNA analysis. Predictive biomarkers for immune-related toxicity are also needed. Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy are being explored to see whether responses may be augmented."
9781910797471,ch03,"Several classifications of cardiomyopathies have been proposed . Patients may present with arrhythmia (including sudden cardiac death), syncope or HF . Several other genetic disorders include cardiac hypertrophy as a component . Examples of such disorders include . Fabry disease . glycogen storage disease (PRKAG2, LAMP2, Pompe) . Glycogen storage diseases are rare genetic causes of cardiomyopathy . Systolic function is usually preserved at least until the very advanced stage of the disease . Underlying conduction disease also limits treatment choices and requires pacing in some cases . ATTR wild-type disease is a slow progressive cardiomyopathy found mainly in patients over 80 years of age . The disease occurs more often in males and may present with isolated cardiac infiltration and carpal tunnel syndrome . Mayo Clinic staging allows assessment of the severity of cardiac involvement, prognosis and response to treatment in AL disease . Patients are stratified into three groups . Management of cardiac amyloidosis includes supportive therapy for HF and arrhythmia, and treatment of underlying amyloid disease . The disease is progressive in nature and the classic form has its onset in childhood . Cardiac involvement includes LVH, valvular disease with predominant mitral insufficiency, ascending aortic aneurysm formation, CAD and conduction disease . Patients may present with symptoms of HF, arrhythmia or MI . Cardiac sarcoid . Conduction disease is the commonest cardiac presentation; complete heart block is not uncommon . Cardiomyopathy and HF may develop in undiagnosed cases . Conduction disease including sinus node disease may coexist . In up to 15% of cases cardiac involvement may precede the involvement of other organs . Established cardiac disease is rarely responsive to therapy . Therapy includes management of the underlying cause, the treatment of HF, arrhythmia and thromboembolism, and heart transplantation in selected cases . Typical manifestation of this disease includes HF, chest pain or arrhythmias . Treatment of inflammatory cardiomyopathy includes standard HF medications and immunosuppressive therapy in selected cases . Often, the coronary arteries show little or no disease . HF presenting in the last month of pregnancy and 5 months after delivery . lack of other causes of cardiomyopathy . no pre-existing heart disease before pregnancy . Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy . Its recognition is important, as treatment often reverses HF and LV damage . Rarely, persistent ventricular tachycardia may present as HF . However, the heart rate itself is not a good predictor of HF . Athlete's heart . These findings are also present in patients who have similar metabolic diseases, including impaired glucose tolerance and obesity; a unifying feature may be insulin resistance . However, follow-up studies have shown an association with the subsequent development of HF . Cardiac surveillance of cancer therapy should include an annual history and physical examination . Common causes of worsened heart failure . Identification, prevention and early treatment of these form the target for disease management programs . Ischemic heart disease . Ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and HF . Optimal BP control is an essential element of therapy in hypertensive heart disease . Valvular heart disease . They often present with a relatively low pressure gradient on echocardiography but with severe symptoms of HF . Acute regurgitation, which presents with acute dyspnea and HF, is a cardiac emergency . Symptoms include progressive dyspnea, angina and symptoms of HF . Mitral valve regurgitation is one of the commonest valvular diseases leading to HF . Chronic regurgitation leads to progressive breathlessness, initially on effort, with the development of symptoms of HF . Rare causes of structural tricuspid valve regurgitation include endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and trauma . Symptoms of left-sided heart or pulmonary disease are prominent in most secondary cases . Symptoms include dyspnea and progressive right-sided HF . Symptoms include right-sided HF and arrhythmia . Patient prosthesis mismatch . ","Ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (HF). Arterial hypertension is an important cause of new presentation but also a powerful precipitant of acute worsening of existing HF. Aortic valve disease is an important cause of HF. Surgery is the best therapy for suitable candidates; assessment of severity in the context of existing cardiac dysfunction can be challenging, but helps to define individuals who would benefit most from surgery. Surgery is always required for organic mitral valve regurgitation, but if the cause is functional then surgery may not help and may even be deleterious. All patients with a new diagnosis of cardiomyopathy require cardiologic referral. Cardiotoxicity is one of the most serious side effects of cancer therapy; cardiac function must be assessed at baseline and during therapy. Timely detection and treatment of cardiac and non-cardiac factors that may worsen HF, and in some cases preventative measures, constitute an inherent part of modern HF management."
9781908541024,ch_11,"About 15% of PCNSL patients have ocular involvement, and 50-80% of those with isolated ocular lymphoma develop parenchymal brain lymphoma . Complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including slit lamp examination, is recommended in all newly diagnosed patients . Systemic lymphoma is an uncommon finding (occurring in 3-5% of PCNSL patients) and the need to perform a comprehensive assessment of the systemic extent of disease is controversial . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the standard neuroimaging technique for the evaluation of PCNSL . Table 10.1 summarizes the approaches to evaluating patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL . Ideally, all patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL should be treated as part of a clinical trial or referred to an appropriate tertiary care center for evaluation and treatment . Multifocal lesions raise the possibility of metastatic disease, and this may be confounded by the fact that as many as 15% of PCNSL patients have a previous diagnosis of systemic cancer . Surgery is critical for histopathological diagnosis . Corticosteroids may have a potent oncolytic effect in PCNSL, causing tumor cell lysis and radiographic regression in up to 40% of patients . Therefore, steroids should be withheld in any patient with a presumptive diagnosis of PCNSL until histopathological diagnosis is secured . PCNSL is a radiosensitive tumor and whole-brain radiotherapy was the standard treatment for many years . Ongoing studies suggest that lower doses of radiotherapy may be safe and effective in chemosensitive patients . PCNSL is a chemosensitive tumor . High-dose methotrexate is the single most effective agent in the treatment of PCNSL (Figure 10.1) . Importantly, older patients are able to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy without any excess acute morbidity . However, prolonged survival is possible and some patients continue to be sensitive to salvage therapy despite multiple relapses . There is no standard salvage therapy . Radiotherapy is particularly effective for ocular relapse . Older patients who defer initial radiotherapy remain responsive to this treatment modality, but are at high risk of developing subsequent neurotoxicity . Treatment-related neurotoxicity . A diagnosis of delayed neurotoxicity requires exclusion of recurrent PCNSL by neuroimaging and CSF cytology . Other agents, such as methylphenidate, have been successful in individual patients . Delayed treatment-related cerebrovascular disease has been observed in younger patients 7-10 years after completion of therapy . HIV-related PCNSL . However, there has since been a significant decline in HIV-related PCNSL . HIV-related PCNSL is associated with infection of B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus . There is a propensity for the lymphoma to develop in the CNS of these patients, presumably because of decreased immune surveillance . Patients with HIV-related PCNSL have a median age of 30-40 years and seizures are a more common presenting feature (encountered in 25% of cases) than in other PCNSL patients . Some studies have found a higher incidence of multiple lesions in HIV-related PCNSL; however, multifocal lesions in AIDS patients may have multiple concurrent etiologies . Although patterns of CNS disease in AIDS patients have been changing, toxoplasmosis and PCNSL remain the most common intracranial lesions . Improved therapeutic options and prolonged survival in HIV-positive patients mandate an aggressive approach to achieving a precise diagnosis for an intracranial lesion . The identification of Epstein-Barr viral DNA in the CSF strongly suggests a diagnosis of PCNSL . Treatment is influenced by the clinical assessment of the patient . However, many patients are not able to tolerate this approach . Ocular lymphoma, a variant of PCNSL, is also increasing in incidence . Unlike cerebral PCNSL, diagnosis is often delayed and a misdiagnosis of chronic vitreitis or uveitis is common . The best treatment option for this subset of patients is not known . Patients treated for isolated ocular lymphoma have an 80% risk of developing cerebral involvement as long as 10 years after initial diagnosis . Primary central nervous system lymphoma . First, it has increased in incidence in immunocompetent patients over the past few decades . ","Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is increasing in incidence in the immunocompetent population. The approach to diagnosis and treatment of PCNSL is significantly different from that for other primary brain tumors: - steroids should be avoided prior to obtaining diagnostic tissue - stereotactic biopsy should be used for tissue diagnosis; complete resection is not indicated - optimal treatment includes methotrexate-based chemotherapy, with or without cranial radiotherapy - older patients should be treated with chemotherapy alone to avoid treatment-related dementia. Ideally, all patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL should be treated as part of a clinical trial or referred to an appropriate tertiary care center for evaluation and treatment."
9781912776238,ch7,"The definition of a biosimilar is a regulatory and legal issue, for biosimilars cannot be defined by a single analytic or clinical trial comparison . Developing and regulating follow-on biologics to such standards requires a significant level of investment and expertise by pharmaceutical companies and regulators that may not be available in low- and middle-income nations . By definition, such drugs that fail to demonstrate equivalence over all five of the WHO/EMA pathway steps are called 'intended-copy' biologics . Intended-copy biologics in general . 'Intended-copy' biologics have arisen as a means of delivering affordable medicines in markets with less stringent regulatory pathways . Such medicines, while clinically active, may not be close enough to the originator molecule to be judged biosimilar in analytic or clinical testing . Without either a biosimilarity exercise or the security of a large-scale Phase III trial in each indication (for extrapolation cannot be approved in the absence of biosimilarity or a pivotal clinical trial), the safety and efficacy of such medicines cannot be predicted . While intended-copy biologics are unlikely to be encountered in clinical practice in the EU and USA, it should be borne in mind that such products have been misleadingly identified as biosimilars . Examples of clinical problems that have arisen following use of such products are described in the following sections . In the press, these products have been referred to as biosimilars; incidents such as these may fuel concerns with true biosimilars where such concerns are unfounded . Note that intended-copy biologics have also been referred to as 'non-comparable biotherapeutic products', 'biomimics' 'biogenerics' and 'bioquestionables' . This is not to say that intended-copy drugs are bad medicines, just that they are not biosimilars, as understood by the WHO and many regulators . Indeed, the EMA has written that such drugs are not justified scientifically . The point is that intended-copy biologics, when approved, are inherently less predictable for real-world outcomes . The following examples illustrate the problems that can arise with intended-copy biologics that have not been through the regulatory scrutiny of biosimilars . Such examples may also have tarnished the reputation of biosimilars and contributed to clinicians' concerns about equivalence, possibly exacerbated by the incorrect use of terminology in both the press and scientific journals . Intended-copy epoetin . Twelve such intended-copy biologics were analyzed in a joint Thai-Dutch study . Some showed high aggregate levels and contained substantial levels of protein fragments - a critical attribute of these medicines that has been strongly associated with a rare but potentially fatal adverse drug reaction . Worryingly, Thai reporters misattributed the problem to 'biosimilar recombinant human erythropoietin', and the misinformation was continued by subsequent editorials and opinion pieces . For example, an editorial in the scientifically respected peer-reviewed journal Kidney International explained: Biosimilar agents may not undergo the same quality control in their production, packaging, storage, and distribution as their patented competitors . The extensive use of biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agents led to an epidemic of PRCA in Thailand . Both statements are incorrect, as both original reference drugs and WHO-compliant biosimilar drugs are assessed according to the same standard quality control, including packaging, storage and distribution . Further follow-up pharmacovigilance studies for biologics and biosimilars in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population did not show any differences in adverse event profiles . Intended-copy rituximab . The problem with intended-copy biologics is that they have neither the security of biosimilarity studies nor large volumes of clinical data to predict their safety and efficacy . Furthermore, the analytic standards of the Indian regulator would be considered unacceptable in Europe, Japan or the USA . This level of clinical uncertainty over a WHO essential cancer medicine such as rituximab is unacceptable . There had been expectations that the manufacturer would perform a 1000-patient postauthorization safety and efficacy study of rituximab-Reditux following its launch in 2007 . In this example too, an intended-copy biologic was misrepresented as a biosimilar . Editorials - even in Biosimilar Journal in 2013 - misnamed rituximab-Reditux as a biosimilar . The Adis Insights drug database listed Reditux as a biosimilar (July 2017) . ",'Intended-copy' biologics manufactured in countries with less stringent regulation than the EU and USA may not be true biosimilars and clinical equivalence cannot be assumed. Inaccurate use of terminology has clouded the distinction between biosimilars and intended-copy biologics.
9781908541024,ch_3,"Patients with brain tumors typically develop neurological signs and symptoms over a period of weeks to months . Some will have an abrupt onset of signs and symptoms similar to that seen in patients with a cerebrovascular infarct . Occasionally, however, patients will have signs or symptoms, such as a chronic seizure disorder, for years prior to the diagnosis of a low-grade tumor . Symptoms and signs may result from increased intracranial pressure, tumor invasion, obstructive hydrocephalus, tumor secretions or secondary cerebral ischemia . Initial symptoms are often vague and non-specific (Table 2.1) . Some typical misleading scenarios include a sudden or insidious change in personality or mood that is misdiagnosed as depression but is refractory to therapy, or an unexplained change in a patient's usual headache pattern or the development of new headaches in an atypical age group (young children or older adults) . The various neurological symptoms and signs caused by brain tumors may be generalized, localizing or falsely localizing . Headache is the most common symptom of a brain tumor . Typically, the headache is non-specific and occurs equally in patients with and without increased intracranial pressure . Since headache is also the most common neurological complaint in the general population, it is important to note specific features of a patient's headache, as these can assist the diagnostic evaluation . Features that should increase suspicion of a tumor include . daily headache on waking that improves over a short interval of time . new headache in a middle-aged or older person . change in pattern, character or severity of a chronic headache . exacerbation of headache by coughing, sneezing, bending, head movement or exertion . headache accompanied by other neurological symptoms . acute headache followed by vomiting . Although headache is the most common symptom of a brain tumor, many patients do not have a headache . Other generalized signs and symptoms . These events, called plateau waves, are often precipitated by change in position and may be mistaken for a seizure . Localizing and falsely localizing features . The most common localizing sign of a brain tumor is seizure; patients typically have focal seizures with or without secondary generalization . Falsely localizing signs seen with increased intracranial pressure include: cranial nerve I, III, IV, VI or VIII abnormality, ipsilateral hemiparesis and ataxia (Table 2.3) . Seizures occur in about one-third of patients; they are often the initial and only symptom . Up to 20% of adults with new-onset seizures will have an underlying brain tumor . Seizures are more common in low-grade than high-grade tumors . Focal seizures are common in situations where the tumor compresses cortex, especially adjacent to the motor strip . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the gold standard for the imaging of brain tumors . Specific signal characteristics often allow the radiologist to predict the histological diagnosis (Table 2.4) . Perfusion magnetic resonance images give an indication of tumor vascularity and may be a reliable marker of tumor grade . Functional MRI allows areas of brain function to be mapped . This may be useful for presurgical planning to allow maximal resection while sparing critical areas of neurological function . CT scanning may also be helpful in determining the extent of bony destruction or hyperostosis related to tumor growth . Patients with a medical contraindication for MRI (exempli gratia cardiac pacemaker, ferromagnetic foreign body) should be imaged with CT . Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine study that provides metabolic tumor imaging . Uptake is increased in proportion with tumor grade . PET scans are clinically useful in guiding stereotactic needle biopsy (Figure 2.3), or differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor . SPECT may be useful in differentiating tumor from radiation necrosis, and has been used extensively to differentiate between tumor and infection in HIV-positive patients . Definitive histopathological diagnosis is essential before administering specific antitumor therapy . the patient's age and clinical presentation . the radiographic appearance of the tumor . prior therapy, including preoperative interventions such as embolization that may cause focal necrosis . Clinical correlation is critical to the interpretation of both neuroimaging and pathology . ","Initial symptoms and signs of a brain tumor are often vague or non-specific; many patients will have a normal neurological examination. Headache, the most common symptom of a brain tumor, is also the most common neurological complaint in the general population. Therefore, attention to specific features of a patient's headache should guide the clinician's index of suspicion and diagnostic evaluation. Seizures occur in one-third of patients and any adult with new onset seizures should be evaluated for an underlying brain tumor. Although neuroimaging may suggest a specific diagnosis, tissue should be obtained for pathological review in all patients before instituting any therapy. The only exception to this rule is the patient with a typical infiltrating pontine glioma, where the risks of surgery outweigh the benefit. Ideally, the clinician should review images and pathology information directly with the radiologist and neuropathologist. Improvements in neuroimaging may be most useful in assessing response to newer therapies, particularly targeted molecular strategies that may be cytostatic."
9783318067095,ch3,"There are countless articles and books that discuss regulatory considerations associated with medical product development . It is essential to understand that regulatory agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate medical products (like drugs and diagnostic devices) but not the practice of medical care . Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) . Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) . Medical devices . The CDRH is often the point of contact for digital medicine developers who are building digital medical products such as 'software as a medical device' (SaMD) . A 'device' is a term of art at the FDA, which means that it has a precise and specialized meaning . The CDRH is responsible for regulating digital 'devices' but not digital tools . As such, we limit our use of the term 'device' in this book to be consistent with the FDA's definition for a 'medical device' (see FDA 2013 and 2017) . For the US market, it is important to distinguish that the FDA does not regulate what the product actually does, but rather what an organization claims the product does . If Product A states that the intended use of this measurement is for a wellness purpose, it likely is not regulated . If Product B says the intended use of this measurement is to make a diagnosis, then it would be considered a 'device' and regulated by the FDA . This means that the exact same product can be developed and marketed either as a 'device' (and thus, regulated) or not a device (and unregulated) simply through a change of words, and no change in hardware or code . A better question would be about the intended use of the product (id est is the organization making a medical device claim?) . The FDA has an open-door policy and encourages organizations to come early and often during product development . It is good practice to initiate the conversation about regulatory designation of the product early . Whether the software is a 'device' is ultimately determined by a regulatory body and likely will depend upon the software's intended functions . Class I devices require little safety testing . Class II devices . These types of devices represent around 10% of devices regulated by the CDRH . Implantable pacemakers and breast implants are examples of Class III devices . Devices that perform a similar function to an existing device on the market (a predicate) can be approved simply by demonstrating that they are at least as effective and no more dangerous than the existing device . Whether or not a proposed device has a predicate impacts the regulatory pathway the device can use . For instance, a 'de novo' classification does not require comparison with an existing device on the market . FDA-approved versus FDA-cleared . 'Approved' indicates that the device successfully completed an FDA premarket approval (PMA), which evaluates the safety and effectiveness of Class III high-risk products . Defining 'device' . Determining the nature of a digital product is especially challenging because the FDA has other mechanisms like enforcement discretion, where the FDA may determine that the product is a 'device', but chooses not to regulate it . Talking with the appropriate regulatory authority early and often is important during the product development process; it will minimize surprises and develop a forward-thinking regulatory strategy . If the manufacturer of that system does not claim it has a medical use (exempli gratia diagnostic, monitoring), the product will not be regulated by the CDRH . Table 3.2 is a 'cheat sheet' of the primary pathways to market through the CDRH for a software product . Drugs and biologics . Phase I 'first in human' trials test the drugs in healthy human participants . In these trials, the drug is already licensed for use and is being prescribed to patients . Phase IV trials allow sponsors (biopharma and device manufacturers) to see how the product is performing in the 'real world' . The regulatory terms that describe tools, methods, materials or measures that can potentially facilitate the medical product's development are drug development tools (DDTs) or medical device development tools (MDDTs) ('tools' are different from 'devices' at the FDA) . There are also combination products, which contain both a drug and software that meets the definition of a device because of its function . For example, Abilify MyCite is a drug-device combination product comprised of aripiprazole tablets embedded with a software-based ingestible event marker intended to track drug ingestion . ","Agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate what manufacturers claim a product can do (rather than what a product actually does), which means that a product can be considered a 'device' (and regulated) or not a device (and not regulated) through only a change in words and no change to hardware or software. Digital measurement tools that are considered a 'device' are regulated by the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). Digital tools that support drug applications (exempli gratia those that capture digital endpoint data) are regulated by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Increasingly more manufacturers of digital products are considering the 'de novo' regulatory pathway so they do not have to deal with predicates and can develop an application that better reflects the software's unique characteristics. The regulatory frameworks for digital tools are in flux, and developers should continue to read upcoming guidance, comment on the revisions in the public docket and engage in the process to improve regulatory decision-making."
9781908541963,chapter8,"Some patients will develop complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, portal hypertensive bleeding and/or hepatic encephalopathy . Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis and usually heralds a progressive downhill course . Approximately 50% of patients with ascites from cirrhosis will have died after 2 years . Although this chapter deals with ascites caused by cirrhosis, it should be remembered that cirrhosis is not the only cause of fluid accumulation in the abdomen (Table 8.1) . Most patients with cirrhosis will report developing abdominal distension as ascites develops . The patient should be questioned about history or risk factors for liver disease . are usually present . Most patients have peripheral edema . Blood tests usually document evidence of liver dysfunction . Diagnostic paracentesis is mandatory for all patients with new ascites (Table 8.2) . A peripheral albumin level should be determined . The SAAG is calculated by subtracting the ascites albumin level from the serum albumin level . Treatment of the underlying liver disease is the optimal treatment of ascites (Table 8.3) but, unfortunately, may not be a practical option . All patients with ascites should restrict their dietary sodium intake to less than 2 g per day . Fluid restriction to 1.5 liters is advised but may be more stringent in patients with significant hyponatremia . Diuretics offer relief to many patients . Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is a safe and effective technique for the rapid treatment of ascites . Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) may help patients with ascites refractory to other treatments . Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with refractory ascites, provided they are otherwise good candidates (see Chapter 12) . Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should be suspected in a patient with ascites who is not doing well . Hepatorenal syndrome is a feared complication of cirrhosis, sometimes seen in patients with advanced liver disease and ascites . Portal hypertensive bleeding . Esophagogastric varices are present in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis . Not all patients with varices will bleed, but those who do have a poor prognosis . Despite significant advances in treatment of patients who bleed, mortality remains extraordinarily high . Thus, preventing the first episode of bleeding (primary prevention) is essential for patients at risk . Primary prevention . Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for varices by endoscopy . If varices of significant size are identified, prophylactic treatment should be started (Table 8.4) . The dosages are increased until the patient's heart rate is 50-60 beats per minute . Endoscopic band ligation may benefit patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers . Active bleeding . Variceal bleeding is rarely subtle and should be suspected in any patient with gastrointestinal bleeding and a history or evidence of chronic liver disease . The patient often presents in extremis, hypotensive with hematemesis and melena . Prompt endoscopy will enable identification of varices and the opportunity to control active bleeding . Several techniques are available . EVL usually controls active bleeding with few complications and is therefore the preferred procedure . Like EVL, ES is effective in controlling bleeding . ES is often easier to perform in patients who are actively bleeding, but is associated with more complications than EVL . Both EVL and ES help to prevent further episodes of bleeding . Pharmacological control . Somatostatin and terlipressin control bleeding in approximately 75% of patients, but neither drug is available in the USA . Hepatic encephalopathy . Hepatic encephalopathy encompasses a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with established liver disease in the absence of other metabolic or structural brain abnormalities . in a patient with advanced liver disease . Renal and electrolyte abnormalities are common in patients with cirrhosis who are taking diuretics, and should be corrected . Patients who are acutely encephalopathic often benefit from aggressive dosing until they have bowel movements . Tap-water enemas containing lactulose are used for patients unable to take oral lactulose . ","Diagnostic paracentesis is mandatory in any patient with new ascites. Salt restriction and diuretics are effective in most patients with ascites. Repeated large-volume paracentesis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be required for refractory cases. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for varices. If these are present, prophylactic treatment with beta-blockers is recommended. Acute variceal bleeding is best treated with endoscopic techniques; however, pharmacotherapy also has a limited role. Hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. Lactulose, rifaximin and correction of precipitating factors are the mainstays of treatment."
9781905832729,ch_10,"Suprapontine lesions tend to lead to detrusor overactivity, although coordinated sphincter function is preserved . These lesions can therefore result in frequency, urgency and urgency incontinence . Suprasacral spinal lesions that interfere with reflex control of the bladder from the higher centers will produce detrusor overactivity . This is seen in many patients with neurological bladder dysfunction and is characterized by spontaneous involuntary detrusor contractions, with or without the sensation of urgency, leading to urinary incontinence . Peripheral lesions . In patients with such lesions, the external urethral sphincter may fail to relax (isolated distal sphincter obstruction) and may also be weakened, giving rise to stress incontinence . The diagnosis of neuropathic bladder disorders requires an understanding of the underlying neurological abnormality, which will be apparent in most patients . However, some patients will present with the symptoms of a neuropathic bladder but with no overt neurological cause . In this situation, it is important to consider the possibility of an undiagnosed neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord lesion, as neuropathic bladder may be the presenting symptom . In patients with cervical lesions, especially those with complete spinal cord transection, it may be difficult to assess symptoms as many will be atypical or unconscious rather than the classic 'urge' type symptoms . Patients with acontractile bladders tend to leak urine as a result of retention with overflow or in association with sphincter weakness . Despite these measures, some patients will continue to have problems with DSD and will require catheterization to empty the bladder and prevent the long-term complications associated with the condition . The options for these patients are intermittent self-catheterization, or long-term indwelling catheterization with a urethral or suprapubic catheter . Many patients catheterize themselves on a regular basis throughout the day (and night) to ensure bladder emptying . (Figure 9.1) In patients with neuropathic bladder, the number of catheterizations required will depend on factors such as fluid intake, ambient temperature, bladder capacity and social factors; most patients need to catheterize four or five times each day . If possible, the patient should void prior to catheterization . For self-catheterization to be successful in patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction, the bladder must be able to store urine adequately without leaking, a condition that can be facilitated through the use of antimuscarinic medication (see Table 4.3) . The patient must be physically able and motivated to perform catheterization, or a caregiver must be able to do it for them . Patients and caregivers need access to healthcare professionals who can teach them the technique and provide adequate support and appropriate catheters . Examples of catheters used for ISC are shown in Figure 9.2 . However, it may occasionally be used for shorter periods (< 30 days) if patients are undecided about their preferred management option . It is also easier to change on a regular basis and causes less discomfort than may be experienced when changing a urethral catheter . Catheter problems . It is therefore essential that the patient is transferred to hospital immediately if no one is available to insert a replacement catheter . Patients should keep a spare catheter at home in case problems arise . Some patients are more prone to catheter blockage than others . Patients who frequently have blocked catheters should be managed with high fluid intake, more regular catheter changes and changing to different catheter material . Other problems seen with urethral or suprapubic indwelling catheters include catheter-associated UTIs, bypassing of urine around the catheter, pain and discomfort, bladder stones and hematuria . Catheter changes . In general, most indwelling catheters need to be changed every 4-6 weeks . The catheter should be changed by an appropriately trained person, who can be a doctor, nurse, caregiver, relative or the patient . All patients with spinal cord injury and bladder dysfunction are susceptible to renal damage if the intravesical pressure is not adequately controlled . Many, therefore, feel such patients should undergo yearly cystoscopies and bladder washes for cytology . Neuropathic bladder dysfunction . Most neurological diseases that affect the spinal cord and some that affect the brain will cause bladder dysfunction, which, if untreated, may lead to incontinence . ","Neuropathic bladder dysfunction can be classified according to the site of the lesion as suprapontine, suprasacral spinal or peripheral. Suprapontine lesions are largely associated with Parkinson's disease, dementia and cerebrovascular accident. They usually lead to detrusor overactivity but coordinated sphincter function is preserved. Suprasacral spinal lesions are associated with spinal cord injury, spina bifida and tumors, and interfere with the reflex control of the bladder from higher centers, resulting in detrusor overactivity and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Increased intravesical pressure can damage the ureters and, ultimately, the kidneys. Peripheral lesions affecting the nerve roots cause bladder areflexia or acontractility, such that the bladder fails to empty without straining. Sphincteric weakness may also contribute to incontinence. Management of detrusor overactivity aims to enable low-pressure storage of urine and bladder emptying without obstruction, achieved by antimuscarinic drugs, injection of botulinum toxin or surgery. Some patients require catheterization to ensure bladder emptying. Options are intermittent self-catheterization, if the bladder can store urine adequately without leaking (often achieved with antimuscarinic drugs), or a urethral or suprapubic indwelling catheter."
9781908541024,ch_7,"Surgical complications include hemorrhage, new or worsened neurological deficits, and infections . However, complications are uncommon, even though many patients with meningiomas are elderly . Meningiomas that are completely resected are associated with recurrence rates of approximately 3% at 5 years and 20% at 20 years . Meningiomas are highly vascular tumors, hence the blood supply must be coagulated before the tumor is removed by internal decompression . Usually, approximately 1 cm of dural attachment is removed with the tumor, as there is no distinct margin separating the meningioma from the dura . If CT or MRI demonstrates an enhancing dural tail, this should be removed with the tumor . Meningiomas that involve the cerebral and cerebellar convexities can usually be completely removed . It is best to remove as much tumor as possible without damaging the sinus . Observation and radiotherapy are the usual ways of dealing with residual tumor surrounding the sinus . Skull base meningiomas are particularly difficult to manage because they usually invade dura and compress vital blood vessels and cranial nerves . For such tumors located in inaccessible areas, aggressive surgical approaches that are likely to cause considerable and permanent morbidity are now often replaced by limited surgical resection combined with postoperative confocal radiotherapy . Similarly, optic nerve sheath meningiomas cannot be resected without sacrificing vision, and should therefore be treated with stereotactic radiotherapy if they are progressive . Radiotherapy is becoming an increasingly important treatment option for meningiomas after initial subtotal resection or following recurrence . Radiotherapy appears to induce apoptosis in meningioma cells and consequently causes cessation of tumor growth, rather than tumor regression . Despite these concerns, radiotherapy substantially delays time-to-recurrence for patients with meningiomas, with the most encouraging series reporting 10-year progression-free survival rates of 83% in patients who have undergone subtotal resection of benign meningiomas . There are limited therapeutic options for patients with meningiomas that are recurrent or progressive following maximal surgery and radiotherapy . Antiestrogenic and antiprogestational agents have been evaluated as potential treatments because meningiomas often express steroid receptors and the growth kinetics of some of these tumors are influenced by female sex hormones . Most trials have failed to show chemotherapeutic drugs to be effective for benign or malignant meningiomas . Meningiomas are neoplasms that arise from the coverings of the brain and spinal cord, the meninges . The annual incidence of meningiomas is at least 2 per 100000 . Meningiomas comprise approximately 20% of all brain tumors, and at least 90% are histologically benign or typical . The WHO classification of meningiomas is presented in Table 6.1 . With the exception of the papillary meningioma, which tends to be particularly aggressive, these subtypes are descriptive and without prognostic significance . Atypical meningiomas have frequent mitoses, large nuclei with prominent nucleoli, increased cellularity and necrosis . Meningiomas are most frequently diagnosed in patients aged 50-80 years, and affect women 2-3 times as often as men (Table 6.2) . Most patients present with seizures as their only symptom, and 10% have no symptoms at diagnosis . The diagnosis of meningioma is suggested by the unique radiographic features (Figure 6.1) . Although most meningiomas are histologically benign, they cause considerable morbidity because they are often not completely resectable, or are progressive or recurrent . Nevertheless, benign meningiomas are associated with a median survival in excess of 10 years with treatment . Because meningiomas are frequently asymptomatic and tend to occur in elderly patients, the decision to treat is often a controversial one . When patients are diagnosed with an asymptomatic meningioma by CT or MRI, a period of observation of up to 1 year is often suggested before a decision is taken to treat the tumor . The decision to delay treatment is based on the indolent and very long natural history of most meningiomas . For patients who have meningiomas that cause persistent neurological deficits, or for patients whose tumors have unusual radiographic features or are causing significant cerebral edema, an immediate intervention is often recommended . ","Meningiomas are the most common intracranial neoplasm. Most are low-grade and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic meningiomas may not require specific treatment, and can be observed by serial CT or MRI. Surgery is the principal therapeutic modality for symptomatic meningiomas, but many meningiomas cannot be completely resected because of their location in high-risk areas. Radiotherapy can achieve long-term growth stabilization of recurrent or enlarging meningiomas. There are no effective medical therapies for recurrent or malignant meningiomas."
9781910797495,chp6,"The neuropathy may or may not be painful, though over 45% of individuals who have had diabetes for 25 years will experience painful DN . Patients report a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mildly disturbing tingling to severe pain that can interfere with sleep and normal activities . Pain may be burning and constant and there may be intermittent electric-shock-like symptoms . The degree of nerve damage does not correlate with pain intensity, and patients can develop insensitive feet without preceding pain or paresthesias . Table 6.1 lists the major types of painful diabetic neuropathy . All of the other types of neuropathy can be painful . However, these laboratory tests are not necessary to make the diagnosis of DN and to begin the successful treatment of pain . Primary care providers should ask patients about unsteadiness in walking and the presence of pain, paresthesia or numbness . Metabolic treatment seems to be a promising approach . The effectiveness of TCAs for DN has been confirmed in meta-analyses of RCTs . However, 1 in 3 individuals develops minor side effects and 1 in 17 stops the medication because of the severity of side effects . Side effects . The effectiveness of anticonvulsants has been confirmed in meta-analyses of RCTs . Side effects . Side effects . The associated pain is usually mild or moderate in intensity, but it may be excruciating . Advancing age is an important risk factor for developing PHN . After acute herpes zoster infection, 2% of patients under 60 years old develop PHN, but this figure progressively increases to about 50% with advancing age . The apparent severity of PHN reported in RCTs is higher, perhaps reflecting a referral bias . Other risk factors are the severity of the acute zoster lesions and the intensity of the acute pain . The duration of PHN is highly variable: at least 30% of all individuals with this type of pain will continue to have severe pain 1 year after the onset of herpes zoster . Patients describe a sharp jabbing burning pain or a deep aching pain, with extreme sensitivity to touch and temperature change . PHN often has three distinct types of pain (Table 6.2) . Prevention of PHN is a key strategy as, once developed, PHN is very difficult to treat . Antiviral treatment . If acute herpes zoster occurs, antiviral treatment should be given as soon as possible to reduce the severity and duration of the acute zoster episode and thus indirectly decrease the risk of PHN (there is no direct effect of antiviral treatment on PHN) . Meta-analyses of RCTs have indicated that aciclovir (acyclovir) reduces the severity and duration of herpes zoster and acute zoster-associated pain . However, as the condition is often well established before treatment is started, antiviral therapy may be of limited effectiveness . Effective pain treatment in the acute phase reduces risk of PHN . Given the risk of side effects, TCAs should be used with caution in older patients; a trial of gabapentin or pregabalin may be preferable . Pharmacological management of established PHN . Overall, pharmacological treatment of PHN tends to be unsatisfactory . It is not clear why some patients obtain good pain relief while others do not . However, supportive evidence from RCTs is lacking . Meta-analyses of RCTs show that corticosteroids do not prevent PHN . Tricyclic antidepressants are useful for PHN, as in DN (see pages 95 -) . SSRIs do not seem to be effective . Anticonvulsants can effectively relieve postherpetic pain, as shown by meta-analyses of RCTs . The degree of effect is similar to that reported for DN (see pages 96 -) . Gabapentin, pregabalin and sodium valproate have been reported to be effective in PHN . Capsaicin relieves pain associated with PHN . Discussion on the use of opioids in DN (see pages 97 -) applies equally to use in PHN or other neuropathic chronic pain . Invasive approaches may need to be considered for severe neuropathic pain that does not respond to the usual treatments . Systemic lidocaine infusion may be used to bring a severe exacerbation of pain under control . ","Persistent hyperglycemia is the primary factor responsible for nerve damage in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic neuropathy (DN) affects the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems. Maintenance of near-normal blood glucose levels is the best approach to primary and secondary prevention of DN. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and anticonvulsants are the medications of choice for neuropathic pain, but side effects are common. Pregabalin is specifically approved for DN. Duloxetine has also gained approval for DN in some countries. Combining medications that address different mechanisms (exempli gratia SNRIs or TCAs with gabapentinoids), while being mindful of drug interactions, can be helpful for treatment-resistant cases, and may enable smaller doses of one or both drugs to be given, which may reduce the total side-effect burden. Although efficacy in clinical trials is established, the use of opioids for the treatment of neuropathic pain remains controversial because of safety and overdose concerns, particularly in at-risk individuals, such as those with substance use disorder or psychiatric comorbidities, or those using benzodiazepines or other sedatives. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is pain that persists after the vesicular rash of herpes zoster has resolved. During an attack of acute herpes zoster (shingles), reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), previously dormant in the dorsal root ganglia, induces inflammation and neuronal destruction. TCAs and anticonvulsants are useful therapies for PHN; the physical, psychological and social consequences of PHN should also receive attention. Once developed, PHN is difficult to manage and thus efforts to prevent PHN are crucial via: prevention of VZV infection, boosting VZV immunity, treating at the time of acute herpes zoster infection, and effective treatment of the acute pain."
9781910797587,chp02,"The menisci have only relatively recently become a focus for OA research, and they probably play a crucial role in OA pathogenesis, both as a cause and as a consequence of the disease process . Meniscal damage and tears, as well as some degree of meniscal extrusion, are very common in established OA . Functional joint pathology . Joint stability . Malalignment of the knee increases load through the medial compartment in the varus knee . Associations with both increased medial bone mineral density and bone-marrow lesions on MRI have been described . Periarticular muscles may become weaker as a consequence of OA pain; conversely, weak periarticular muscles may be a risk factor for the development of OA . Radiographic pathology . Radiography has been the long-established method for evaluating in-vivo pathology in OA . Calcium crystals are commonly seen in joint aspirates from OA joints, and research into joint-replacement tissue suggests that calcification is extremely common in joints with end-stage OA . MRI pathology . MRI studies have helped our understanding of the extent and complexity of OA pathology . MRI enables a three-dimensional evaluation of the joint and allows bone, cartilage and soft tissue to be visualized . Early OA MRI studies focused on assessment of cartilage (since one of the great strengths of MRI above conventional radiographs is the direct detection and quantification of cartilage), but later studies included assessment of multiple intra-articular features . These studies confirmed common abnormalities of most of the tissues in the painful OA joint, demonstrating not only cartilage thinning and loss but also bone-marrow lesions, synovitis, meniscal damage and extrusion, and ligament abnormalities (Figures 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10) . Using MRI, almost 90% of people over 50 with normal weight-bearing knee radiographs are found to have OA joint pathologies . The prevalence of most MRI abnormalities increases with age . MRI has also provided novel insights into bone pathology in OA . Bone-marrow lesions have been associated with subsequent progression of joint-space narrowing and cartilage loss in the same joint compartment . The correlation between pain and MRI features is discussed on page 50 . Cartilage metabolism changes dramatically as OA develops . Cytokine activity plays a major role in cartilage homeostasis and is important in driving the OA process . These enzymes, which are produced by cartilage and synovium in normal cartilage homeostasis (see Table 1.1), play a major role in the breakdown of cartilage in OA . Increased levels of MMP have been demonstrated in OA cartilage compared with normal cartilage, particularly in the upper zones . The relative proportions of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) are also altered in OA cartilage . Other proteases also play a role in cartilage breakdown, directly or indirectly . Subchondral bone . Changes in subchondral bone . Changes in bone vascularity . Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to increased bone and cartilage angiogenesis and vascularity in OA . It is also unclear whether atherosclerotic disease contributes to OA initiation or progression, and this risk may differ by anatomic site . MRI changes in bone are described later in this chapter . Synovitis - inflammation of the synovium - occurs with increasing frequency with progressive severity of OA . This synovitis is independently associated with subsequent joint replacement . Researchers have also demonstrated the existence of synovitis in early clinical disease . Causes of synovitis . There may of course be different drivers of synovitis over the lifetime course of OA within a given joint . An autosensitization process is also suggested by the presence of autoantibodies to native and denatured type II collagen found in OA cartilage, immunoglobulin-complement complexes demonstrated in superficial OA cartilage and terminal complement components demonstrated in OA synovium . Histological changes of synovitis in patients with OA are generally different from those seen in patients with RA by a matter of degree . In OA synovitis, the thickness of the lining layer increases, angiogenesis increases, and mononuclear and plasma-cell cellular infiltration occurs . ","All tissues of the joint may show pathology, including cartilage, subchondral bone, the menisci and the synovium. The joint should be considered a functional organ, with gait, periarticular muscles and related mechanical forces all playing a role in pathology. Modern imaging has highlighted the extensive nature of the pathology, even in joints with limited radiographic evidence of damage."
9781908541406,ch_11,"Liver disorders . The coagulation changes in patients with liver disease are complex and often arise as a result of several different mechanisms . The liver is the principal site for synthesis and clearance of many hemostatic and fibrinolytic proteins . The bleeding risk is also dependent on the platelet count, which is influenced by the degree of splenomegaly secondary to liver-induced portal hypertension . The coagulation changes depend, in part, on the pathogenesis of the underlying liver disease and its rate of onset . In general, liver disease can be divided, from the perspective of hemostasis, into the following four broad groups . cirrhosis in which there is decreased synthesis of clotting factors . Decreased synthesis of clotting factors . Chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, results in diminished synthesis of clotting factors, especially factor (F)II, FVII, FIX and FX . Impaired g-carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX and X . Patients with chronic liver disease have reduced carboxylase activity, resulting in incomplete carboxylation of the precursor peptides . Various changes in fibrinolysis are observed in liver disease . Thus, the balance of fibrinolysis varies from patient to patient . FVIII and FV . FV is also synthesized predominantly by the liver; a reduced plasma level is a feature of liver failure . It is sometimes useful to measure FV and FVIII to distinguish the coagulopathy of DIC from that of liver disease . In DIC, levels of both factors are decreased, whereas in liver disease FV is low but FVIII is usually normal or high . In liver disease the platelet count is usually normal or reduced . The liver is a source of thrombopoietin, a protein that stimulates platelet production; decreased concentrations have been reported in patients with liver failure . Mild splenomegaly results in platelet pooling, and a platelet count of 75-125 x 10 /L often accompanies cirrhosis . The count may be further reduced by alcohol intake, which inhibits the production of platelets by megakaryocytes . Stopping alcohol consumption often results in a sharp rise in the platelet count after several days . Coagulation inhibitors . Impaired antithrombin synthesis by the diseased liver leads to a reduced plasma concentration, which may predispose to a consumptive coagulopathy . Patients with both advanced liver disease and severe acute hepatitis are at risk of DIC (see Chapter 12) . Treatment of the coagulopathy associated with liver disease needs to address risks of bleeding and thrombosis . However, prolonged PT is not significantly associated with bleeding . Furthermore, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials that support the effectiveness of fresh frozen plasma in limiting bleeding from invasive procedures in patients with cirrhosis . Experience with these agents in patients with liver disease is limited . The bleeding observed in patients with renal failure, usually bruising and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, is generally attributed to defects in platelet adhesion and aggregation . Dialysis substantially reduces the risk of bleeding and is the mainstay of management to keep the hemorrhagic risk under control . Bleeding in patients with renal failure is often due to angiodysplasia, peptic ulcers, gastritis and other mucosal abnormalities . However, the bleeding is exacerbated by platelet abnormalities . Parathormone is elevated in renal failure and also increases platelet cAMP . Intrinsic platelet defects include decreased ADP and serotonin in the platelet dense granules . Reduced platelet aggregation may be due to depressed platelet production of the potent platelet agonist thromboxane A2 . Anemia contributes to the bleeding risk; there is an inverse relationship between the bleeding time and hematocrit . The hematocrit needs to be raised to 27-32% to normalize the bleeding time . Clinical features of uremic bleeding . Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis generally reduce the bleeding risk, though they may not be equally effective in all patients . In patients with renal failure, it rapidly shortens the bleeding time and improves hemostasis . Although often effective, the response is unpredictable and this blood product has the risks of allergic reactions and transmission of infection . ","Liver disorders Acute and chronic liver disease can give rise to a variety of different hemostatic disorders; it is therefore important to assess each patient fully. Vitamin K therapy should be given if there is any possibility of deficiency. Although many patients have abnormal clotting tests, it is usually only necessary to treat those patients who are actively bleeding or require surgical intervention. Kidney disorders The risk of bleeding increases with the degree of renal failure. Dialysis reduces the hemorrhagic risk. Correction of anemia in the short term by red cell transfusion or in the long term with regular erythropoietin injections reduces the risk of bleeding."
9781912776153,chp5,"For example, a patient with pre-excitation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) may have palpitations unrelated to conduction over the accessory pathway, such as sinus tachycardia due to anxiety . Further investigation of patients with palpitations depends on the severity of the episode and the frequency of the attacks . Which patients are most at risk of cardiac arrhythmias? . Patients at risk of cardiac arrhythmias can often be determined by obtaining a history and physical examination, and by reviewing baseline tests . In addition, any history to suggest the presence of structural heart disease, including hypertension or diabetes, makes an arrhythmia much more likely to be the cause of symptoms . Clinical examination should be performed to look for evidence of structural heart disease, including a cardiac murmur, signs of congestive heart failure as well as hypertension . Referral for more detailed investigations to exclude structural heart disease may be necessary for some patients, particularly those with ventricular ectopics . Additional investigation may include an echocardiogram (cardiac ultrasound), which will give accurate information about the pumping action of the heart and the structure of the heart and valves . Documenting cardiac arrhythmias . Recording of a rhythm during symptoms is crucial to establishing the cause of palpitations . The frequency of symptoms will dictate the best investigation to carry out (Table 5.1) . For example, in a patient who presents with a sustained arrhythmia and is not hemodynamically compromised, a 12-lead ECG is mandatory . However, digital recording of rhythm abnormalities has replaced the traditional ECG in many circumstances, especially when palpitations are infrequent . Types of recorders (continuous vs intermittent) . Table 5.2 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the three main types of recorder . Continuous Holter monitor . Electrodes attached to the skin record the electrical activity of the heart (Figure 5.1) . These monitors are often used for 24-hour recording, but can be worn for up to 72 hours if required . The patient wears a device on the wrist or around the waist . The patient can trigger the device to record a rhythm strip at the time of symptoms, or auto-trigger features may be programmable . Smartphone and smartwatch monitoring . The expansion and continual enhancement of these wearable technologies can provide patients with the potential to verify their rhythm at any time, and this may assist physicians in the management of patients . Inducing or provoking an arrhythmia . Electrophysiological (EP) testing was conceived in the 1960s as a means to provoke and study a patient's cardiac arrhythmia . Many patients, particularly those with severe or life-threatening arrhythmias, require provocative procedures to induce the tachycardia . For example, if palpitations, ventricular ectopic beats or syncope have occurred in a patient who has previously had a myocardial infarction and has left ventricular dysfunction, an EP study can determine whether ventricular tachycardia is inducible and is likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms . Abnormal recordings during an EP study may determine whether a pacemaker is required . However, the advent of digital recording methods, as well as the importance of left ventricular function in determining therapy, has meant that the EP study is now performed only infrequently to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias . Instead, the EP laboratory has become a site for treating cardiac arrhythmias with catheter ablation procedures or device implantation . Treadmill exercise testing . Treadmill exercise testing can be used to evaluate arrhythmias, and is occasionally a useful option, particularly in cases where symptoms occur under exercise conditions . Arrhythmias may occur during the exercise test, but there is often an even greater propensity for arrhythmias to occur during the recovery phase . This is particularly the case when automaticity is mostly responsible for the cardiac arrhythmias, such as patients with ventricular ectopy or ventricular tachycardia without overt heart disease . In these patients, the exercise test will not only be useful at provoking the cardiac arrhythmia, but will also assist in planning ablation, in view of the importance of the 12-lead morphology of ventricular tachycardia at predicting the region of the heart that requires mapping and ablation . ","Performing an electrocardiogram (12-lead if possible) during symptoms is essential. The frequency of a patient's symptoms will determine the best non-invasive test to apply. Non-invasive monitoring can be performed repeatedly if needed. Digital and smartphone technologies will expand in use in future. Treadmill exercise testing can be useful to induce cardiac arrhythmias in selected patients. Electrophysiological (EP) testing was initially conceived to provoke and identify cardiac arrhythmias. However, it is now performed infrequently solely as a diagnostic test; instead it is more often performed during an ablation procedure."
9781910797433,ch09,"Non-epithelial tumors are rare, accounting for 10-15% of all ovarian malignant neoplasms . The most common types are germ cell tumors (GCTs) and sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) (Table 9.1) . They will commonly present at younger ages, compared with the more common epithelial ovarian cancer . Germ cell tumors . Malignant germ cell tumors arising in the ovary (MOGCT) are estimated to affect about 60 women each year in England . They typically occur in older adolescents and young women, but rarely may also occur in the postmenopausal population . In rare cases, these tumors can arise from fully differentiated teratomas or dermoids, which are more common and benign conditions . In addition, several very rare syndromes linked with gonadal dysgenesis, including Turner and Swyer syndrome, have been associated with MOGCT, and it remains possible that there could be exceptionally rare families with increased risk, as seen in malignant testicular germ cell tumors . Since germ cells can differentiate to form all cell types seen in neonates and adults, any combination of pathologies is possible, although some are more common than others . For example, elements of yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma and dysgerminoma are more commonly seen than embryonal or rhabdomyosarcoma . The elements present can help to predict clinical behavior and the production of tumor markers . Tumor markers . Patients with choriocarcinoma/trophoblastic tumor elements will usually have elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and those with yolk sac tumors will produce alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (Table 9.2) . In addition, CA125 may be non-specifically raised in any type of MOGCT induced by peritoneal irritation . Thus, measurement of AFP, hCG and CA125 can help in the diagnostic work-up of patients with a suspected ovarian mass, and should be done in any woman under the age of 50 years who wants a fertility-sparing approach to treatment . This is because elevated hCG or AFP is virtually diagnostic of MOGCT, and could lead to fertility-sparing surgery rather than the usual more radical surgery used for primary epithelial cancers . Clinical presentation and investigations . Usually patients present with only a short history of lower abdominal swelling and pain arising from the pelvis, as these tumors tend to grow rapidly . SCSTs arise from the sex cords and ovarian stroma, and account for 5-8% of ovarian cancers . The diagnosis of an SCST should be suspected in patients with . Potential biomarkers of SCSTs are shown in Table 9.3 . Granulosa cell tumors are the most common form of SCST, and account for 2-5% of all ovarian malignant neoplasms . There are two subtypes of granulosa cell tumors: juvenile and adult . Juvenile-type tumors account for only 5% of granulosa cell tumors, and typically occur in children and young adults . Histologically, these tumors are characterized by lobulated cells with signs of luteinization . Adult-type tumors typically present during the perimenopausal or menopausal period . Adult subtype granulosa cell tumors have a microfollicular pattern, while juvenile subtypes present with a macrofollicular or cystic pattern . Maximal effort debulking surgery, aiming at complete cytoreduction, is the most effective treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent granulosa cell tumors . In patients with hormone receptor-positive disease, antihormonal treatment has also been shown to be effective . Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors typically occur during the third and fourth decades of life: about 75% of patients are under 40 years old at diagnosis . They secrete androgens, hence 75-80% of patients show signs of virilization . Typically, patients present with abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass . Surgery forms the mainstay of treatment of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors . Surgical treatment guidelines are similar to those for granulosa cell tumors, with fertility-sparing approaches being considered in early disease and young patients wishing to have children . Platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy, for example with BEP, is recommended for patients with unresectable or disseminated disease . ","Non-epithelial malignant neoplasms account for 10-15% of ovarian cancers. They occur at younger ages than the more common epithelial ovarian cancer. Adequate surgical staging is essential, and should be performed even when fertility-sparing surgery is planned. Complete cytoreduction is the cornerstone of treatment in advanced and relapsed disease. There is inconclusive evidence for the use of systemic chemotherapy, rather than antihormonal treatment, in malignant non-epithelial ovarian tumors. In completely resected disease, there is little evidence to support a survival benefit with additional systemic treatment."
9781910797587,chp01,"articular cartilage . subchondral bone . synovial fluid . Articular cartilage . Histologically, the cartilage is seen as an upper non-calcified layer divided into the following zones . superficial, with few cells and tangential collagen fibers (zone I) . The only cells in cartilage are chondrocytes . Extracellular matrix . Cartilage tissue is largely composed of an extracellular matrix that is both synthesized and broken down by the chondrocytes . This matrix is very well hydrated, consisting of 70-80% water, protein collagen fibers, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans and some non-collagen proteins . Articular cartilage has no blood vessels, lymphatics or nerves, so the chondrocytes receive nutrition by diffusion of molecules from the synovial fluid in the joint cavity through the extracellular matrix . One of the main functions of cartilage is to absorb and dissipate mechanical load . The collagen fibers of the extracellular matrix give tensile strength and three-dimensional shape to the cartilage . The fibers are composed of compact, triple-helical collagen molecules (Figure 1.4), which are classified according to length and side chains: collagen type II makes up 80-90% of the articular cartilage collagen . The aggrecan molecules in the extracellular matrix are stabilized by link protein and are attached to hyaluronic acid (HA) molecules, which are also very large glycosaminoglycans . One HA molecule may bind up to 200 aggrecan molecules, forming a macromolecular aggregate (see Figure 1.5) . Aggrecan gives cartilage its elastic properties in circumstances of compressive load . Other non-collagenous proteins . The roles of other, less abundant, non-collagenous proteins in the extracellular matrix, including cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, decorin, lumican and biglycan, are less fully understood . Mechanical loading increases proteoglycan production by chondrocytes . Tidemark and cement line . Subchondral bone . Subchondral bone comprises a subchondral plate and underlying trabecular bone . Like cartilage, the thickness of the subchondral bone may vary with location within a joint; it may be thicker in the central weight-bearing areas of joints . Bone composition . The bone matrix is composed primarily of inorganic mineral, with about 25% comprising organic matrix and cells . The cellular elements of bone are . osteoblasts, which are of mesenchymal cell origin and produce collagen and bone matrix . Type I collagen is the major organic component of bone . The type I collagen molecules are cross-linked by molecules such as pyridinoline . Non-collagenous proteins present in the matrix include proteoglycans, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein . Normal bone homeostasis . It consists of a continual surface layer of cells (the intimal or lining layer) and underlying tissue (the subintimal layer) . The intimal layer, which is generally one or two cells (25-35 µm) in thickness, contains two cell types, or synoviocytes, which form a tight extracellular matrix by interdigitation of cell processes . Type B cells are functionally specialized compared with fibroblasts from other sites . It comprises blood and lymphatic vessels, and a range of cells . Synovial fluid . Molecules and cells pass in and out of the synovial fluid passage via the synovial intima and its underlying microcirculation . The intimal matrix has a sieve-like role, allowing diffusion of water and other small molecules while preventing the rapid movement of large molecules such as albumin and HA . The synovial fluid is largely composed of an ultrafiltrate of plasma (except for the HA concentration) . Its major non-cellular constituents are HA and proteins of relatively low molecular weight such as albumin and B globulins . Synovial fluid is highly viscous and its volume varies from joint to joint; normal values are not well defined . The synovial intimal cells regulate the volume of synovial fluid, largely by control of HA production . ","The synovial joint should be seen as a single dynamic structure with inter-relating components. Articular hyaline cartilage lines the end of each bone within a joint; it allows an efficient gliding motion when the joint moves, and absorbs and dissipates mechanical load. Subchondral bone is intimately associated with the overlying cartilage, which together probably act as a single structure for load transmission. Healthy synovial joints contain a small amount of synovial fluid, a lubricating liquid that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the cartilage. The complex joint structure provides frictionless articulation and load-bearing abilities."
9781910797211,ch08,"Drug-induced parkinsonism . This is the most common cause of secondary parkinsonism and it is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, because clinical features may be indistinguishable . The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism is estimated to be 15-40% in patients receiving neuroleptics, and its prevalence increases with age . There is some evidence that patients who develop drug-induced parkinsonism may have subclinical Lewy body Parkinson's disease, which may be unmasked by dopamine-blocking agents . However, patients rarely die without developing these abnormalities . Usually, patients die within 5-10 years because of increasing bulbar problems and immobility . Pathologically confirmed PSP has been shown to have two clinical phenotypes: Richardson's syndrome and PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P) . Patients with PSP-P may develop the other features of PSP described above later in the course of the disease . Some patients may have associated neurofibrillary tangles consistent with coincidental Alzheimer's disease . Rarely, patients develop supranuclear gaze palsy; this may lead to the condition being mistaken for PSP . Response to levodopa tends not to be as complete as in Parkinson's disease, although some patients do respond . The phenomenon is known as the alien limb and can occur in about 50% of patients . Patients with CBGD do not benefit from levodopa, and the disease course is relentlessly progressive . Other clinical signs include frontotemporal dementia, and visuospatial and visuoperceptive deficits . Parkinsonism in young adults . The onset of parkinsonism before the age of 40 years is usually called young-onset parkinsonism . Onset of Parkinson's disease at this age is not rare . Patients with young-onset parkinsonism manifest dystonia, which may respond to dopaminergic drugs . Patients demonstrate an excellent and sustained response to low-dose levodopa . A combination of parkinsonism and ataxia is characteristic of neurological Wilson's disease . Almost all patients with neurological features have MRI abnormalities in the basal ganglia . Not all patients have a low ceruloplasmin level because inflammation, infection or oral contraceptive use may cause false elevations . However, the Westphal variant of the disease, which affects the young, may resemble parkinsonism . Eye-movement abnormalities, including apraxia, distinguish juvenile Huntington's disease from Parkinson's disease . Ipsilateral corticospinal tract signs, which are not a feature of Parkinson's disease, may be found . Neuroacanthocytosis is a rare cause of parkinsonism and typically presents with a hyperkinetic movement disorder, including chorea, tic-like features and polyneuropathy . Secondary parkinsonism . The term 'secondary parkinsonism' refers to parkinsonism induced by known agents or factors . Patients had headache, fever, somnolence and ophthalmoplegia . After a variable delay, a number of patients developed parkinsonism associated with psychiatric abnormalities, ophthalmoplegia and oculogyric crises . In a follow-up study of 50 patients, a third continued to benefit, a third showed no response and the remaining patients could not tolerate the drug . Neurological complications, including parkinsonism, may occur in patients with AIDS . The clinical features include parkinsonism characterized by early difficulties with gait and balance, early speech problems, and dystonia involving the face (grimace) and feet (cock walk) . Clinically, patients may have tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia . Tumors are a rare cause of parkinsonism . Usually patients present with a one-sided, progressive syndrome that does not respond to levodopa . Other signs, such as upper motor neuron signs and a rapidly progressive disease course, will distinguish tumor-related parkinsonism from Parkinson's disease and will determine whether a diagnostic scan is necessary . Vascular disease is a rare cause of a straightforward parkinsonian syndrome with a variety of clinical presentations . Post-traumatic parkinsonism . An isolated head injury seldom leads to parkinsonism unless it causes significant brain damage . Miscellaneous causes . Parkinsonism may occur transiently during alcohol withdrawal . Metabolic causes include hypoparathyroidism with basal ganglia calcifications . ","It may be impossible to distinguish Parkinson's disease from other parkinsonian syndromes by clinial features alone. Progressive supranuclear palsy presents with gait disturbance and falls in later life; asymmetric signs (exempli gratia rest-tremor) favor a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Patients with parkinsonian dementia with Lewy bodies have early-onset dementia, and may have hallucinations or psychosis in the absence of dopaminergic therapy. Parkinsonism that presents before the age of 20 is more likely to be the result of a widespread degenerative or genetic disorder. Drug-induced parkinsonism is the most common cause of secondary parkinsonism."
9781910797181,ch08,"Tobacco smoking is a highly toxic form of nicotine use . Without effective intervention, cigarette smoking is expected to have killed some 520 million people worldwide by 2050 . Fortunately, many governments around the world are beginning to wake up to the magnitude of the problem, and are developing tobacco control programs . Unfortunately, the health services in most countries have not been geared up to provide evidence-based support for quitting, even very low-cost clinical programs that could be incorporated into existing clinical services . In countries that do have comprehensive smoking cessation programs, the challenge is in ensuring that smokers make full use of these services . While research on improving treatments for smoking-related disorders continues, smoking cessation remains our best hope for reducing the burden of tobacco-related death and disease over the next 50 years . If higher rates of smoking cessation are to be achieved, concerted action is required on all fronts: fiscal, legislative, educational and clinical . develop clinical interventions that improve on the success rates of existing methods . make greater use of effective treatments so that the proportion of attempts that are successful increases considerably . Improved forms of nicotine-replacement therapy . It seems reasonable to suppose that if a pure nicotine delivery system could be found that was almost as efficient as the cigarette and also as palatable, it would be more effective than the current generation of nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) products in helping smokers to quit . However, it also seems likely that smokers would transfer their dependence to this product . Nevertheless, even if smokers continued to use such a product indefinitely, there would be minimal health risks, so this is an important area for development . Ensuring effective use of nicotine-replacement therapy . There is now evidence that in countries where it has been studied, such as the UK, use of NRT bought over the counter and used without any professional support is not improving smokers' success rates . There is an urgent need to find out why and to take steps to ensure that smokers gain the benefit they expect . It is possible that these smokers are not using enough of the product or not using it for long enough for it to be effective . In that case, cheap scalable interventions to improve adherence to medication instructions could make a substantial difference . Work is also under way on a number of nicotine 'vaccines' that aim to prevent nicotine being taken up into the CNS, in order to dampen its effects there and thus make quitting or staying abstinent easier . To date, no vaccine has been found to be effective in clinical trials but the principle is intriguing and research continues . Increasing use of traditional treatment services . If that smoker attends a smokers' clinic and receives behavioral support and medication, the chance rises to 20% . However, at present only about 3% of smokers take advantage of these clinics in the UK each year, even though they are provided free of charge . Similarly, use of telephone counseling services in the USA is very low . Raising it to 10% would have an important effect on public health . The challenge is to find ways to increase uptake . Some studies have shown increased uptake when the clinician directly connects the patient to treatment services (exempli gratia arranging for a quitline counselor to call) . Novel channels for delivery of treatment services . So far, smoking cessation services have been delivered via traditional clinical channels, often modeled on mental health services, such as one-to-one meetings with a counselor, or group meetings with other smokers . Many smokers find these forms of treatment unappealing, and their availability is often limited . Telephone helplines have proven to be effective, when provided by a trained counselor following evidence-based protocols . Telephone counseling that depends on smokers' initiative to call for help ('hotlines') is under-used and not as effective as counseling programs that schedule regular calls, paralleling the structure of face-to-face counseling . A systematic review of randomized controlled trials has concluded that internet-based interventions can aid cessation but many do not and it is not clear what features make an effective internet support program . A very large randomized trial in the UK found that an open-source internet intervention called StopAdvisor increased quit rates in blue-collar smokers (smokers in manual jobs) but not white-collar smokers (professionals) . It had been specifically developed to appeal to the former group . Although more than 200 stop-smoking apps are available, very few have data on their effectiveness . Most of them are unlikely to be effective given that they do not use evidence-based behavior change techniques . ","If the pandemic of death from lung disease and cardiovascular disease is to be controlled, millions of smokers must quit. Price increases and mass media campaigns play a crucial role in motivating attempts to stop smoking. Effective treatments are available to support quit attempts; a major challenge lies in finding ways to get these treatments to the majority of smokers. In many countries, affordable and scalable systems need to be developed to ensure that smokers are offered evidence-based support for stopping as a matter of routine. In countries that have comprehensive smoking cessation programs, such as the UK and the USA, the main challenge is to ensure that smokers make full use of such services. More effective treatments, and treatments to help smokers who are not currently being helped, are focuses for current and future research."
9781912776207,ch3,"T-cell lymphomas account for 10-15% of lymphoid malignancies, although the incidence varies geographically (see page 38) . The incidence of PTCL in the USA is less than 1 per 100 000 according to the latest Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry . Here, 'T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoid neoplasms' accounted for 6% of all lymphoid neoplasms (B-cell lymphoid neoplasms accounted for 80% and Hodgkin lymphoma for 7%) . During 1997-2006, the incidence of T/NK-cell lymphoid neoplasms in the SEER registry was tenfold lower than that of B-cell lymphoid neoplasms (2.09 vs 27.96 per 100 000) . While the incidence of lymphoid neoplasms as a whole appears to have plateaued in the USA during 1997-2006, this largely reflects slowing in the rate of increase of B-cell neoplasms, particularly in white men . Rates of T/NK-cell lymphoid neoplasms rose by 1.17% annually, and higher rates were seen in black men (2.2%) and Asian women (2.3%) . The rate of PTCL increased by 3.78% over this time, with markedly greater increases in AITL (14%) and PTCL-NOS (5.5%) . There was a decrease in the incidence of ALCL (2.0%) but this, and the concomitant increase in AITL, may have been related to changes in coding . The incidence of the different subtypes of PTCL in the SEER registry is shown in Table 3.1 . PTCL affects twice as many men as women . Ethnic differences . For example, the frequency of AITL is higher among Asian men than black or white men . A study of 13 107 cases of PTCL in SEER registries between 2000 and 2012 reported that the annual incidence was highest in black people and lowest in Native Americans . Differences in the distribution of the different subtypes were also reported (all p < 0.05) . The incidence of PTCL-NOS, ALCL and ATLL was higher in black than in non-Hispanic white people, whereas the incidence of AITL was lower . Asians/Pacific Islanders had a higher incidence of AITL, ATLL, nasal-type ENKTCL and NK-cell leukemia, and a lower incidence of ALCL . Hispanic people had a higher incidence of AITL and ENKTCL . Native Americans had a lower incidence of PTCL-NOS . The frequency of the most common subtypes of PTCL varies geographically . In Europe, the nodal subtypes account for more than 80% of PTCL cases in Caucasian patients (PTCL-NOS 34%; AITL 28%; ALK + ALCL 6%; ALK - ALCL 9%) . PTCL-NOS is more common in North America but less common in Europe and East Asia . AITL is more common in Europe than in Asia or North America . For ALCL, the ALK + form is more common in North America whereas the ALK - form is more common in Europe . EATL is more common in areas with a high incidence of celiac disease - it accounts for 5.8% and 9.1% of PTCLs in North America and Europe, respectively, but only 1.9% in Asia . As noted above, the increasing incidence of ENKTCL in East Asia is partly due to endemic HTLV-1 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections . Lymphomas associated with HTLV-1 include ATLL, smoldering ATLL (small numbers of circulating leukemia cells but no nodal involvement), lymphomatous ATLL (lymphadenopathy but no leukemia involvement) and chronic ATLL . Demographic and biological data support the early involvement of EBV in the initiation and potentiation of ENKTCL . The virus is present in clonal form in virtually all cases of ENKTCL and aggressive NK leukemia, irrespective of ethnicity . EBV may also contribute to the transformation of Tfh cells in AITL . EBV has also been detected in most AITL biopsies, although the majority of the EBV-harboring cells are polyclonal B cells; the malignant T cells are EBV-negative . ","T-cell lymphomas are rare, representing approximately 10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. PTCL subtypes display marked variation in geographic distribution; AITL and EATL are more frequent in Europe whereas ATLL is more common in Japan and the Caribbean basin and ENKTCL in South East Asia. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 is strongly implicated in lymphomagenesis in ATLL, and Epstein-Barr virus in ENKTCL."
9781908541062,ch_3,"Family studies and twin studies indicate that there is a genetic susceptibility to RA, which is higher in families with more severe disease . Genetic predisposition is estimated to contribute between a half and two-thirds to RA susceptibility . Unlike classic Mendelian diseases such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell disease, RA is a polygenic and genetically heterogeneous disease . Thus, a number of different genes predispose to RA, and these may differ from patient to patient (Figure 2.1) . Essentially, various combinations of polymorphisms in a selection of different genes (genotype) predispose to the clinical picture (phenotype) that is recognized as RA . Additionally, some genes may influence severity rather than occurrence of RA . Until recently, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was the only genetic region that had been consistently linked to RA . The strongest genetic link to RA is the class II HLA region and, in particular, HLA-DRB1 . This core amino acid sequence is termed the 'shared epitope' . The shared epitope influences both the incidence and the severity of RA, and individuals who inherit two shared epitope-encoding HLA-DRB1 alleles suffer particularly aggressive disease . There are other potential explanations for this genetic association, however . In this context, non-inherited maternal HLA molecules may also influence RA susceptibility . Non-MHC genes . Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutionized our understanding of complex diseases such as RA . SNPs that appear more commonly in individuals with the disease in question should lie within or close to genes that are associated with the disease . The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium published the first GWAS of RA and, with subsequent studies, has identified and confirmed a number of genes associated with the disease . Table 2.1 lists genetic loci that have been reproducibly linked to RA in populations of European descent . It has been estimated that approximately 35% of the genetic risk for RA has now been established, most of which is attributable to the MHC . A seminal study has irrefutably linked smoking to the etiology of RA in patients carrying a predisposing genotype . PTPN22 also contributes to RA risk in this model, which clearly demonstrates the influence of smoking on RA development (Figure 2.3) . Other airborne exposures, for example to silica dust and coal dust, have also been associated with the development of RA . The shared epitope and PTPN22 appear to be associated only with ACPA-positive RA, and seronegative disease appears to have a distinct, and much less well defined, etiology . 'Pre-RA' . Whether all individuals who develop autoantibodies will ultimately develop RA is currently uncertain, but there may be important additional environmental triggers for disease onset . Infectious triggers . Despite these examples, no consistent association has been found between RA and any infectious agent, and the disease does not occur in clusters or demonstrate seasonal variation . It is also possible that RA is the consequence of a chronic infection with an as yet unidentified organism . RA is more common in women than in men, suggesting a possible effect of sex hormones on susceptibility . Furthermore, RA generally improves during pregnancy and may flare in the puerperium . Many patients report that certain foods seem to trigger episodes of arthritis . Starvation improves RA symptoms, and a few studies have incriminated a high-protein diet as an arthritogenic trigger . Obesity is also associated with RA in a few epidemiological studies, as is caffeine consumption . Recently, alcohol consumption has been reported to protect against RA development . It is now possible to construct a simple unifying model for seropositive RA (Figure 2.4) . It is notable that many of the genes associated with seropositive RA encode proteins that affect immune cell function and are also associated with other autoimmune diseases . It now appears that smoking triggers the formation of ACPA in genetically predisposed individuals, and that this occurs some years before disease onset . Nonetheless they should probably be incorporated into models designed to explain the etiology of RA . As with many common diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents a balance between nature and nurture, in which environmental factors act upon a genetically predisposed host . In the past few years great advances have been made in dissecting the gene-environment interactions that predispose to RA . ","Genetic and environmental factors both play a role in the etiology of RA. A number of genetic associations with RA have now been identified. Smoking is an important environmental trigger that, in shared-epitope-positive individuals, stimulates the production of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs). Autoantibodies appear up to 15 years before clinical disease is manifest, suggesting a further influence of additional environmental triggers at a later time point. Subclinical inflammation starts to manifest approximately 5 years before disease onset."
9781910797105,ch09,"Management of schizophrenia can be divided into the phases of the disorder . prodromal and first episode . Evidence-based interventions take the form of drug treatments, psychosocial treatments and service level interventions . Multidisciplinary teams are the core of community-based services for people with schizophrenia (Table 9.1) . These are effective when a case management model is used, so that one care coordinator develops and oversees the patient's entire care package . Different models of care management exist, but systematic reviews have shown that it is most effective when combined with assertive community treatment . Meanwhile, specialist rehabilitation services can reduce the enduring deficits of chronic schizophrenia and improve day-to-day social functioning . Prodromal psychosis . The aim of treatment at this stage is to reduce subpsychotic symptoms and associated distress and to prevent progression to full psychosis . If available, cognitive therapy should be offered; otherwise, supportive counseling and monthly follow-up . First-episode psychosis . A first episode of psychosis requires urgent referral to a specialist mental health team or an early intervention team for assessment within 2 weeks . Full diagnostic assessment should include a physical and neurological examination, an assessment of physical health (Table 9.2) and evaluation of substance abuse status . The next step is to communicate the diagnosis and treatment plan effectively to the patient and family where appropriate, including what the diagnosis means and why it has been made . Therapeutic response should be carefully monitored, ideally using a recognized rating scale such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Table 2.7, page 21) . In addition, psychological support and treatment should be initiated, ideally cognitive therapy for 16 weeks in addition to drug treatment . Side effects and weight should be monitored weekly for the first 6 weeks . Improving adherence to pharmacological treatment . Poor adherence to drug treatment is not unique to schizophrenia (Table 9.3) . Long-acting injectable medication should be offered to people, including those after a first episode, who find it difficult to adhere to regular oral medications . Shared decision-making between the person with schizophrenia and healthcare professional, taking into account the views of the carer where appropriate, is the cornerstone of management in schizophrenia and essential to improving outcomes . The clinician must provide quality information on both the benefits and adverse effects of each recommended treatment, and the expected time to response, so that patients and carers can make informed decisions . It is particularly important to discuss the side effects that the person is and is not willing to tolerate in order to minimize non-adherence to treatment . Self-management is also important (Table 9.4) . This is a growing area of activity, especially around the potential of web- and smartphone-based monitoring and interventions to help people with schizophrenia to better manage their own illness (exempli gratia www . com) (Table 9.5) . Remote, ambulant, symptom monitoring with wireless real-time data uploads to a central server, enabling better collaborative management in the form of early intervention and personalized management . Relapse prevention . One mainstay of relapse prevention in schizophrenia is maintenance drug treatment (see page 90), which is known to reduce relapse rates by three to five times if adherence is good . Relapse risk can be reduced further by 50% with added cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) if early signs of relapse, such as racing thoughts or suspiciousness, appear (see Case history 11.1, page 104) . Individuals tend to have a distinctive pattern of early warning signs, known as their 'relapse signature' . In terms of the potential for practical management, controlled studies have shown that monitoring of early warning signs every 1-2 weeks, linked to multicomponent intervention, reduces rates of relapse by about half compared with standard care, id est from about 30% per year to 15% . To prevent full relapse, interventions may be offered such as increasing medication dose, changing drug delivery mode, psychological interventions and psychosocial support . Support for carers . Often, carers of people with schizophrenia require assessment of their own needs . A care plan should be developed to address their needs . the diagnosis and management of schizophrenia . types of support for carers . roles of teams and services . Treatment resistance . About 30% of people will not respond adequately to two adequate trials of drug treatment of different classes . Clozapine should be the next step in drug treatment . ",Assertive community treatment is the most effective model of community care. Urgent specialist referral and multidisciplinary assessment are needed for first-episode psychosis. Cognitive therapy should be offered in addition to drug treatments. Maintaining and improving physical health is vital. Clozapine should be considered early in treatment resistance. m-health approaches are becoming increasingly important.

Device failures and recalls . While manufacturing faults with generator components are rare, leads remain an engineering challenge . All patients with these leads have required regular and frequent surveillance and, in some cases, the leads have had to be extracted . The data can then be monitored remotely while the patient is at home . Leadless pacemakers are being developed . ",Pacemakers are the treatment of choice in patients with symptomatic bradycardia. All implantable defibrillators have a back-up pacemaker. Patients with pacemakers can live a near-normal life. Patients need regular review (usually annually) to check battery life and lead integrity.
9781910797310,chp2,"These symptoms usually trigger a chest X-ray (CXR) . Some lung cancers are identified by an abnormality found on imaging that is carried out for reasons other than chest symptoms (exempli gratia for employment reasons or before elective surgery) . Initial evaluation of a patient after imaging should involve tissue biopsy by bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, or guided ultrasonography or CT . This information, together with radiological staging and a multidisciplinary meeting discussion usually results in a treatment plan . This plan must then be considered in terms of the patient's comorbidities (cardiac and respiratory function) and individual wishes . Every patient with suspected lung cancer should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, which, together with laboratory testing can assess comorbid conditions and the likelihood of metastases . CT, and in some cases positron emission tomography (PET), provides a non-invasive assessment of tumor size (T), mediastinal node enlargement (N) and potential metastases (M) (see Staging, Chapter 3) . Small biopsies and cytology specimens . About 70% of patients present with advanced stage lung cancer . Diagnosis is usually made from small biopsy and cytology specimens . Historically, pathologists only needed to distinguish between small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but in recent years therapeutic and genetic advances have driven the need for larger quantities of tissue for histological subclassification, immunohistochemistry and molecular and immune pathology . The 2015 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart includes a new classification for small biopsies and cytology similar to that proposed in the 2011 Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification . Well-differentiated tumors with adenocarcinoma morphology (acinar, papillary, lepidic, micropapillary) or squamous cell carcinoma (unequivocal keratinization and well-formed classical bridges) on routine light microscopy can be diagnosed as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, without immunohistochemistry . Poorly differentiated tumors should undergo limited immuno-histochemistry . A single adenocarcinoma marker (exempli gratia thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF1] or Napsin-A) or squamous cell carcinoma marker (exempli gratia p40, cytokeratin 5/6 or p63) can be used to classify most tumors . Carcinomas lacking clear differentiation by morphology and immunohistochemistry are classified as 'NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS)' . NOS carcinomas that stain with adenocarcinoma markers are classified as 'NSCLC, favor adenocarcinoma'; tumors that stain with squamous markers are classified as 'NSCLC, favor squamous cell carcinoma' . In this way, a diagnosis of NSCLC-NOS can be avoided in up to 90% of cases . Molecular testing for tumor gene (somatic) mutations . The discovery of specific gene mutations in NSCLC (Table 2.1) has led to the development of targeted therapies . In particular, the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, found primarily in adenocarcinomas, is predictive of responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors . Furthermore, adenocarcinomas with ALK - MET rearrangements are responsive to crizotinib, and patients with adenocarcinoma or NSCLC-NOS are more responsive to pemetrexed than are those with squamous cell carcinoma . In the initial randomized phase 2 study of bevacizumab and chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, bevacizumab was associated with life-threatening hemorrhage in patients with squamous cell carcinoma; therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with this NSCLC histology . ",The 2015 World Health Organization Classification of Lung Tumors recommends the use of immunohistochemistry for the classification of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Classification of NSCLC further into specific pathological subtypes (exempli gratia adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma) will determine eligibility for certain types of molecular testing and aid therapeutic decisions based on the specific histological and genetic characteristics of the tumor. An epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation is a validated predictive marker for response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments.
9781908541178,ch_5,"Identifiable radiographic abnormalities are found in almost all individuals over 50 years old . In geriatric patients, there are often many more abnormalities than necessary to explain the acute, subacute or chronic painful disorder . This has been confirmed in several studies comparing a baseline MRI taken for a symptomatic disc derangement with a follow-up MRI . In a young and otherwise healthy patient who develops acute low back pain after bending and lifting or during vigorous sport activities, radiography or other radiological assessment serves only to reassure the anxious patient or family, and possibly establish a baseline for future comparisons . A concern for low back pain associated with osteoporotic-associated lower lumbar fracture (L3-L5) is a possible neoplasm, either benign or malignant . Tumors may occur anywhere in the spine . Vertebral tumors can be confused with atraumatic or traumatic osteoporotic fractures (Figure 2.1), but are most likely in patients with night pain or in those whose pain is not relieved by rest . Bony lesions in these patients may be better characterized by a computed tomography (CT) scan . These sacroiliac lesions may be identified earlier, however, and monitored more easily during observation by MRI evaluation . MRI is more sensitive than either radiography or CT in identifying abnormalities in patients with low back pain, and does not carry the risk of X-ray exposure, but it is more expensive and more likely to provide worrisome detail rather than useful information . In general, many MRI investigations requested are unnecessary . If not, a decision regarding an MRI can be postponed . However, mass effects on the thecal sac indicative of epidural fibrosis have been observed in more than 50% of patients tested in the immediate postoperative period . The enhancement may persist for a year or more in successfully operated patients without any demonstrable, associated symptoms . Descriptions of disc abnormalities are very important in patients with low back pain, but the nomenclature used to describe disc modifications is not standardized . Annular fissures are a possible marker of clinically significant disc pathology . However, a finding of an abnormal disc bulge may be coincidental and is not indicative of pathology . Other radiological investigations . CT also can assess soft tissues including fat, nerve roots, ligaments and discs . Radiation exposure from CT scans is an increasing concern . The presence of these areas is not indicative of a specific diagnosis, but is very sensitive in identifying spinal fractures . Additional evaluation is required to identify the potential cause of the increased activity . Interventional radiology represents a new frontier in radiology . In a geriatric population and for patients with chronic pain, the specificity is only about 20% . The ability of patients to localize a specific disc derangement by pain-provoking stimulations during discography, and to relate the provoked pain to their symptoms, is also unreliable . When clinical testing for neurological defects is normal or equivocal, or when the radiological findings present too few or too many abnormalities to identify specifically the source of the neural abnormality, electrodiagnostic testing may add greater specificity . Although electrodiagnostic testing can confirm the presence of a nerve root lesion, it cannot indicate the precise level of the nerve root compression . Nonetheless, the precision of EMG in one study of patients with clinical and radiographic (CT) findings of nerve root compression was as low as 20% when the EMG was correlated with surgical findings . Indications for electrodiagnostic studies . any of the above manifestations are present, but are not readily explained by the physical or radiological findings . the patient cannot cooperate in the examination because of psychological or pharmacological (medication, sedation) problems . Laboratory testing . For the most part, with the exception of patients with 'red flags' (see Table 1.1), laboratory testing for patients with low back pain disorders is of little value . Laboratory tests are indicated when a malignancy or infection is suspected . Blood tests are also indicated to identify the potential causes of vertebral osteoporotic fractures . However, it is important to decide which, if any, of these tests will increase understanding of the patient's problem or result in a specific modification of therapy . As the specific pain generator of many low back pain disorders cannot be precisely characterized, the diagnostic limitations of modern, expensive technology must be acknowledged . All these factors need to be considered as you evaluate patients with low back pain, beyond the information gathered during the office examination . ","Identifiable radiographic abnormalities such as disc degeneration, disc protrusions and osteophytes are common in individuals over 40 years of age and almost universal in those over 50, but without corresponding clinical findings. In geriatric patients, radiographic evidence of spinal degeneration is commonplace but may not be a source of back pain. In addition, geriatric radiographic abnormalities tend to persist after a patient goes into remission. In individuals over the age of 50, radiographic evaluation has a greater likelihood of identifying a tumor, osteoporotic fracture, infection or severe spinal stenosis. MRI is the most sensitive radiographic technique to identify anatomic alterations of the spinal elements. Discography is a relatively unreliable method of determining the locus of disc symptomatology, with numerous false positives. When CT/MRI and the examination do not define the pathology, electromyography (EMG) may be helpful, but at best this has less than 80% accuracy in detecting a nerve root lesion. Laboratory tests usually are not needed for acute low back pain unless 'red flags' are present, or for patient monitoring to avoid potential hematologic, hepatic or renal drug-related complications."
9781910797617,chp4,"Treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) involves repeated cycles of myelotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in prolonged cytopenia that requires intensive supportive care . Despite significant advances in supportive care over the last few decades, the treatment of AML is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly related to infection . mandatory hospitalization during chemotherapy . use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) after chemotherapy . prophylactic antifungals . Mandatory hospitalization . During initial induction therapy, it is common practice to admit patients, typically for 3-4 weeks, until neutrophil levels recover, although data to support this approach are limited . In a pediatric population, a retrospective study by the Children's Oncology Group found no evidence that mandatory hospitalization reduced either systemic infections or treatment-related mortality . Similar studies in adults have not been reported, but until more data become available, it seems reasonable to admit patients for at least the first 3-4 weeks of induction chemotherapy, unless easily accessible 24-hour supportive care is available . Limited data suggest that using a high-efficiency particulate-air-filtered facility is beneficial, and although this cannot be considered a standard recommendation, some indirect evidence suggests that this could reduce the rate of fungal infection . Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor after chemotherapy . Numerous studies, including meta-analyses, have consistently shown that the administration of G-CSF after completion of chemotherapy reduces the duration of neutropenia (typically 2-3 weeks) by 2-5 days . Based on current data, G-CSF is not recommended for all patients; however, its use can be considered in order to accelerate neutrophil recovery in patients with active or persistent infection, and those who are hemodynamically unstable secondary to infection . Prophylactic use of quinolone antibiotics has been shown to reduce infection and mortality rates after chemotherapy . Based on the available evidence, antibiotic prophylaxis after chemotherapy can be considered as standard care, and is a component of most international recommendations . While quinolones are recommended on the basis of the available data, it is reasonable to review the treatment center's antibiogram to inform the choice of antibiotic . Prophylactic antifungal therapy . The overall consensus, based on the available data, is that antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole following chemotherapy is beneficial, Micafungin is an alternative if azoles are contraindicated . Leukapheresis, hydroxyurea and low-dose cytosine have all been suggested as treatment for hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell [WBC] count >= 100 000/mm at presentation), although recent data suggest that none of these interventions reduce early treatment-related mortality in high-risk patients . For younger patients, the current recommendation is to start standard 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy (see page 34), as soon as possible after diagnosis . In comparison with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the risk of TLS, and resultant hyperuricemia and renal failure, is relatively low in AML . Among patients with AML, a WBC count at presentation of >=100 000/mm is considered high risk for developing TLS and hyperurcemia, and rasburicase should be considered for prophylaxis . Although not part of any standard recommendation, good central venous access is considered essential for the administration of intensive chemotherapy and for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) . The Hickman catheter is commonly preferred for alloSCT, while a peripherally inserted central venous catheter can also be considered for intensive chemotherapy . Although there are data suggesting that even with chemotherapy, the Hickman catheter is superior; this cannot be considered a standard recommendation based on these limited data . Platelet infusion . The agreed threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusion based on multiple studies is <= 10 000/mm . Recent data suggest that it is not acceptable to withhold prophylactic platelet infusion at this threshold when there is increased risk of bleeding, especially in the central nervous system . Hemoglobin levels should be maintained above 80 g/L following chemotherapy, although lower thresholds for red blood cell transfusions may reduce transfusion exposure without deleterious effects . Granulocyte infusion . There is no evidence to support routine use of granulocyte infusion to reduce treatment-related infection and mortality . ","The standard treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) involves repeated cycles of myelotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in prolonged cytopenia that requires intensive supportive care. Treatment of AML is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly related to infection; this risk is compounded by the emergence of bacteria with multidrug resistance. Standard practice is for patients to be hospitalized for induction chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery is achieved (3-4 weeks). Following chemotherapy, prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and reduce mortality rates is a standard recommendation; the choice of antibiotic should be informed by the local antibiogram. Prophylaxis with antifungals with both anti-mold and anticandida activity is beneficial. Attention to good hygiene, particularly dental and perianal care, is important."
9783318067095,ch7,"Determining the best term boils down to what you are measuring and for what purpose . BEST defines an outcome as any 'measurable characteristic … that is influenced or affected by an individual's baseline state or an intervention as in a clinical trial or other exposure . Clinical outcome or biomarker? . Outcomes are essential measures to determine whether the practice of medicine is working . Outcomes can be clinical outcomes or biomarkers (Box 7.1) . A clinical outcome 'describes or reflects how an individual feels, functions or survives' . For example, 'average gait speed' for walking bouts greater than a certain number of steps measured over multiple days outside the clinic may be a direct measure of mobility, which is one component of physical functioning . A biomarker is 'a defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutic interventions' . For example, a biomarker could be measuring hemoglobin A1c in people with diabetes to determine an individual's average blood sugar level over the past several months . For biomarkers, think 'signs', not 'symptoms', which are more likely a clinical outcome . Most of the time, biomarker measures are not the things that are necessarily meaningful to patients - but the measurements might be accurate representations, predictors or monitors of underlying biology and disease . In many circumstances, meaningful clinical outcomes such as survival or the occurrence of a cardiovascular event may occur so infrequently that they are difficult or unethical to study directly . Biomarkers provide researchers with interim evidence about the safety and efficacy of interventions while more definitive clinical data are collected . Though biomarkers have intrinsic characteristics, they also have contextual ones . A digital biomarker could be any of the seven BEST biomarker types (see Figure 7.1) . Clinical outcome assessments . Clinical outcome assessments (COAs) are the instruments used to measure clinical outcomes, and include the instructions to participants, scoring models and protocols for administration (Figure 7.2) . Interestingly, though, the lines between technology-based assessments and questionnaires have become blurry . The possibility of a fifth COA to describe digital clinical outcome assessments, and specifically those measurements made using technology, was proposed during a summer 2018 Public Workshop at the FDA, though no firm next step was defined . Making human assessments digital . eCOAs have unique properties that offer new ways to measure outcomes . What matters is whether the concept being measured is directly meaningful to patients . 'Ability to go about my daily activities' is a meaningful aspect of health to MS patients . A PRO (or even an ePRO) could measure a person's ability to perform activities of daily living through a self-reported survey . Self-reported measures require the person to reflect on and assess their own ability, leading to data that are meaningful to that individual, but potentially fraught with person-to-person variability, and subject to recall bias . A PerfO (performance outcome) might measure the amount of time it takes a person to walk 25 m . This is easy to measure and may be correlated with the capacity to perform typical daily activities . This approach has the benefit of not relying on patient recall, but it is an imperfect measure of the real outcome of interest - the ability to perform daily living tasks in a natural environment . Composite measures . We can also combine multimodal data from sensors, questionnaires and other clinical data (exempli gratia lab test, genomic tests) to create composite measures or 'complex biomarkers' . A composite measure consists of several individual measures that are combined to reach a single interpretive readout . For example, you could use sensor, keyboard, voice and speech data from a smartphone to construct a composite measure for cognition, and augment that measure over time with genetic data to make it more multimodal . The need for a human intermediary . Over time, a useful distinction between metric types will be whether the measurement required action by a human intermediary to gather the data (Figure 7.3) . At the passive end of the spectrum, human participation is minimal and sensors simply capture data as individuals engage in daily activities like eating and sleeping . Hybrids of these two measures that use multimodal assessments and combine active and passive measures will also be valuable . An example is using actigraphy to passively measure when an individual fell asleep, coupled with an ePRO asking the individual to self-report the time . ","'Effective, unambiguous communication is essential for efficient translation of promising scientific discoveries into approved medical products' (US Food and Drug Administration, BEST framework). Today, many key terms and definitions have been used inconsistently, and this ambiguity makes it difficult to evaluate products and evidence. For many measurements, it can be helpful to think about whether the data were collected actively through human intervention (exempli gratia a clinician observing the patient, or a patient filling in a diary) or passively through a sensor. Most high-quality data sources will likely be 'multimodal', meaning that the data will come from multiple sensors. Developing a common set of language around biomarkers, measurements, outcomes and other terms will streamline premarket discussions between regulators and industry, and also postmarket with patients and providers. The authors defined a first draft set of definitions, which we expect and hope will evolve as technologies and applications develop over time. If someone uses a term you don't know in a conversation, best practice is to ask the person to clarify what they mean. Many terms are still in early development and have loose definitions."
9781908541703,ch_7,"Systemic treatment . Treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years reduces the relative risk of dying from breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women (see below) . Subsequent reviews have confirmed this benefit and tamoxifen has been the standard of care for over 20 years . Extended adjuvant therapy . As always, discussions with patients about extended adjuvant therapy must include both the benefits and potential harms . Patients may become resistant to tamoxifen and relapse during or after completion of therapy . Aromatase inhibitors . There are three treatment strategies . upfront therapy - aromatase inhibitor for 5 years instead of tamoxifen . switch or planned sequence - aromatase inhibitor started at 2-3 years after tamoxifen . extended adjuvant therapy - aromatase inhibitor started after 5 years of tamoxifen . Upfront therapy . Almost all patients completed the treatment schedule . This was maintained in the 51-month analysis of women assigned to monotherapy with either tamoxifen or letrozole . In a switch trial, patients change from, for example, tamoxifen therapy to an aromatase inhibitor after 2 years (having initially been scheduled to receive tamoxifen for 5 years) . In a sequence trial, the change is planned at the start, with patients receiving tamoxifen for 2-3 years and then changing to an aromatase inhibitor . A number of such trials have been performed . Extended adjuvant therapy . The National Canadian Cancer Institute MA-17 trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in over 5000 postmenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer, who were disease free after standard treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years . The women were randomized to receive either placebo or letrozole for a further 5 years . The trial was unblinded and many women crossed over to receive letrozole . So the questions of how long to extend adjuvant treatment with an aromatase inhibitor after 5 years of tamoxifen or when the aromatase inhibitor should be started in relation to tamoxifen remain unanswered . In the trials, patients started an aromatase inhibitor any time after they had taken tamoxifen for 4 years . The fracture risk is present only while the patient is taking the aromatase inhibitor and is probably seen only in women who have reduced BMD before treatment . There are data to indicate that aromatase inhibitors do not have adverse effects on BMD in patients in whom it is normal before treatment . Further trials that compared combination therapy with tamoxifen plus goserelin with tamoxifen plus chemotherapy found that a combination of ovarian suppression and tamoxifen may be equivalent to a first-generation chemotherapy regimen with CMF alone . A GnRH analog may be recommended in women who decline chemotherapy and could be considered instead of tamoxifen in women who may wish to conceive later . confirmed the survival advantage in women given adjuvant CMF over women who did not receive it . This was true for both pre- and postmenopausal women and the benefit has been sustained over 20 years of follow-up . Subsequently, the benefit of chemotherapy has been confirmed in many randomized controlled trials . Furthermore, as drugs were shown to be effective in metastatic breast cancer, they were introduced into the treatment of early breast cancer . Duration of CMF . Studies that compared CMF treatment for 6 and 12 months found that both periods appeared to be equivalent . Treatment of longer duration (12 months) is poorly tolerated . Type of regimen . Type of regimen . Dose intensity . Increasing drug doses . Most of the trials have involved women at relatively high risk (exempli gratia node-positive patients), though some have included high-risk node-negative patients . There is some concern that patients with ER positive disease derive less benefit than patients with ER negative disease . These trials showed a significant benefit of treatment with trastuzumab for 12 months at 2-year follow-up . Duration of treatment remains an important question . Combination treatment . However, other trials have not confirmed this finding . Making the choice of treatment . the best treatment according to the literature . treatment interactions with comorbidity in an individual patient . patient preference . ","Adjuvant hormonal treatment and chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence of breast cancer by 33% and improves survival. The absolute benefit for an individual woman depends on her initial risk. For women with strongly estrogen-receptor(ER) positive breast cancer, endocrine treatment is the mainstay of treatment, and the additional benefit of chemotherapy should be calculated. Postmenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer should be offered an aromatase inhibitor as part of standard adjuvant treatment. Trial evidence supports a further 5 years of hormone therapy in patients who have already received 5 years of tamoxifen -tamoxifen for premenopausal women and an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women. Women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer should be offered anti-HER2-targeted therapy (provided there are no medical contraindications) as part of standard adjuvant treatment. Taxane-based chemotherapy is recommended for women at high risk (node positive and high-risk node negative). Well-designed and managed clinical trials remain the preferred context for treatment."
9781910797150,ch01,"It is estimated that 80-100% of patients receiving chemotherapy without antiemetic prophylaxis will experience some level of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) . The sensation of nausea and the act of vomiting are protective reflexes that rid the intestine and stomach of toxic substances . The experience of nausea is subjective . It is a difficult-to-describe sick or queasy sensation, usually perceived as being in the stomach . Nausea and vomiting are not necessarily on a continuum . Although nausea may be considered a prodromal phase to the act of vomiting, patients may experience significant nausea without vomiting . Conversely, patients may have sudden emesis without nausea . Nausea has been assumed to be the conscious awareness of unusual sensations in the 'vomiting center' of the brainstem (see below), but the existence of such a center and its relationship to nausea remain controversial . Vomiting consists of a pre-ejection phase called retching, and ejection, and is accompanied by shivering and salivation . The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting are not well defined . Vomiting is a reflex activated by toxic substances such as chemotherapy drugs, which may directly affect areas in the cerebral cortex and the medulla oblongata, or may stimulate the small intestine via the vagus nerve . Afferent impulses, triggered from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), pharynx and vagal afferent fibers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, then travel to the vomiting center (VC) - termed the 'central pattern generator' by some authors - in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla (Figure 1.1) . The VC is the primary structure that coordinates the mechanisms of nausea and vomiting; it is sensitive to several neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, substance P), which are released through these pathways . Each individual may require a different level of stimulation to the VC to reach the threshold for nausea or vomiting, such that individuals will experience different responses to the same stimuli . The mechanism that is best supported by research involves an effect on the upper small intestine . When rapidly dividing enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract are damaged, serotonin is released and binds to vagal afferent receptors in the wall of the bowel that activate the VC and stimulate emesis either directly or indirectly through the CTZ . The CTZ is situated in the area postrema of the medulla near the fourth ventricle . It is strongly suspected that the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) neurons, which lie ventrally to the area postrema, initiate emesis . This medullary area is a convergence point for projections arising from the area postrema and the vestibular and vagal afferent . The NTS is a good candidate for the site of action of centrally acting antiemetics . Activation of the VC produces efferent impulses that travel from the VC to the abdominal muscles, salivation center, cranial nerves and respiratory center, causing vomiting . Nausea is thought to be mediated by the autonomic nervous system . Control of CINV . The main approach to the control of emesis has been to identify the active neurotransmitters (Figure 1.2) and their receptors in the CNS and the GI tract that mediate the afferent inputs to the VC . The receptors associated with serotonin and substance P are 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT) and neurokinin-1 (NK-1), respectively . The study of these serotonin and substance P receptors has guided the development of antagonists, with relative success in controlling emesis (Table 1.1) (also see Chapter 3) . Despite some reduction of nausea after treatment with 5HT and NK-1 receptor antagonists (RAs), it remains a problem, suggesting other pathways may be important in controlling nausea . Dopamine RAs have been shown to have some efficacy in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy . They have not been effective in the prevention of CINV . Agents that may affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), histaminic and muscarinic receptors are also being investigated with a view to developing additional effective antiemetic drugs . Dopaminergic, histaminic and muscarinic receptors may be some of the receptors involved in the control of nausea . ","It is estimated that 80-100% of patients receiving chemotherapy without antiemetic prophylaxis will experience some level of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting are triggered when afferent impulses from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), pharynx and vagal afferent fibers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract travel to the vomiting center (VC) in the central nervous system. The main approach to the control of emesis has been to identify the active neurotransmitters (serotonin and substance P) and their receptors (5-hydroxytryptamine-3 [5-HT ] and neurokinin-1 [NK-1]) in the CNS and the GI tract that mediate the afferent inputs to the VC. Several 5-HT and NK-1 receptor antagonists have been developed for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis."

Responses have also been achieved in patients with brain metastases . Response rates are higher in patients whose tumors have higher expression of PD-L1, although responses also occur in patients with low or no expression . Studies comparing nivolumab or pembrolizumab with chemotherapy as first-line therapy have shown conflicting results, probably because of differences in patient selection between trials . As in melanoma, responses have been seen in patients with brain metastases . Checkpoint inhibitors have not proved effective in patients with pancreatic cancer or microsatellite stable colorectal cancers . Head and neck cancer . Activity has also been demonstrated with other agents . Other cancers . Toxicities from checkpoint inhibitors . At present, there are no effective predictors of toxicities . Patients in clinical trials have been highly selected for performance status and good organ function and thus toxicities may be worse in non-trial patient populations . Patients with pre-existing autoimmune toxicities have been excluded from trials of immunotherapies and thus toxicities may be greater in this group . It has not been possible to deliver the same doses of combination therapies used in melanoma to lung cancer patients . Grade 3/4 toxicities have been reported in fewer than 3% of patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; 9% treated with ipilimumab monotherapy, but 19% of patients who received combination therapy . Diarrhea of all grades occurs in 11-19% (grade 3/4 in 0-3%) of patients receiving PD-1 mAbs, and up to one-third of ipilimumab-treated patients (grade 3/4 in 3-6%) . However, with combination therapy, diarrhea occurs in up to 44% of patients (grade 3/4 9%) . Colitis (diarrhea, pain and bleeding/mucous) may develop in a small percentage of patients receiving PD-L1 mAbs, but occurs in 8-12% of both ipilimumab-treated (grade 3/4 in 3-6%) and combination-treated patients (grade 3/4 in 9%) . Occasionally, patients experience gastrointestinal perforation or severe colitis requiring colectomy . Skin toxicities, including pruritus and rash, occur in 14-22% (grade 3/4 in < 1%) of PD-1 mAb-treated patients, 15-35% of ipilimumab-treated patients (grade 3/4 in 1-2%) and 28-33% of patients receiving combination therapy (grade 3/4 2-3%) . Skin toxicities are more common in patients with melanoma than in patients with other tumor types . For example, evidence of hypothyroidism occurs in 4-10% of patients treated with PD-1 mAbs, 2-4% of ipilimumab-treated patients and 15% of combination-treated patients, although it is rarely severe . Fewer than 2% of patients receiving single agents have pituitary function abnormalities, compared with 8% of those who receive combination treatment . Pneumonitis is more common in patients with lung cancer than in those with melanoma . With the PD-1 mAbs, up to 5% of patients with lung cancer experience pneumonitis, which may be grade 3/4 in up to 2% . The incidence appears to be greater in patients who have received significant thoracic radiotherapy . Rheumatological toxicities, including arthralgias and myalgias, occur in 6-12% of patients, but are rarely severe or treatment limiting . Fatigue occurs in 15-34% of patients receiving single-agent therapy and 35% of those receiving combination treatment, among whom it may be severe in up to 4% . Management of toxicities . Patients and staff should be educated about the types of toxicity associated with immunotherapies, and patients should be provided with a card indicating that they are receiving a particular treatment . Expert nurses with knowledge of toxicities and their management should be employed to monitor patients' symptoms and provide education and advice about toxicity management . Toxicity grading systems should be understood . Permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy should be considered for patients with toxicity greater than grade 3 (Figure 4.3) . In symptomatic patients, treatment should be interrupted and steroids initiated as above for liver dysfunction . ","Immune checkpoints are cell surface receptors that are expressed on activated T cells and other immune cells, which normally serve a co-inhibitory role in keeping the adaptive immune system in check to prevent autoimmune diseases. Immune checkpoints may be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies, resulting in T-cell activation and an immune response against cancer. This is analogous to releasing the brakes to accelerate a fast car. Immune checkpoint inhibitors against CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 have produced durable tumor shrinkage and prolonged survival in patients with a variety of solid tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with melanoma, lung cancers, head and neck cancers, bladder cancers, kidney cancers, colorectal cancers, MSI-high solid tumors, Merkel cell cancers and Hodgkin's lymphoma. These include ipilimumab (CTLA-4 mAb), nivolumab, pembrolizumab (PD-1 mAbs), atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab (PD-L1 mAbs). Clinical trials are ongoing for additional indications, as well as various combination therapies. Immune-related adverse events are due to autoimmune inflammation resulting from overactivation of T cells; they include colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, thyroiditis and pneumonitis."

Central to this pathway is the demonstration that there are no significant clinical differences between the biosimilar and the reference biological product . There is no single analytic test for a biosimilar, whether chemical or clinical . Non-clinical - some quality differences may emerge during quality comparability studies; this stage provides information about potential impact on safety and efficacy . Clinical - the purpose of the clinical assessment stage is to investigate differences that may have emerged earlier in the development program and to determine whether the biosimilar performs in a comparable way to the reference product in patients . Figure 4.2 illustrates the data requirements for a biosimilar compared with its reference product; Table 4.2 provides specific details on the requirements . Biosimilars in the USA . For a biosimilar to be designated as interchangeable, proof is required that it will have the same expected clinical results in any given individual patient . This implies that post-marketing data from an already approved biosimilar will be required to gain the interchangeable status . The FDA has emphasized that the closer the analytic match of a biosimilar to the variation observed in the original reference drug, the less the requirement for clinical trial data . Biosimilars are typically approved for most, if not all, the indications of the originator brand, but without a need to provide clinical trial data using the biosimilar in all those indications . This 'extrapolation' may be made by the provision of relevant scientific data that demonstrates biosimilarity: physicochemical data, structural analysis, in vitro function, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic data, and some clinical data . The clinical study is likely to involve the most sensitive patient group/study endpoint(s), selected in discussion with regulators . Further data may be required in order to demonstrate comparability if, for example, the drug has multiple sites of action, particularly if these have different relevance in different indications, or if there are differences between indications in terms of efficacy, safety or immunogenicity . Although clinical data are an important part of the regulatory review for a biosimilar, comparability with the reference drug based on non-clinical studies is an inherent part of the biosimilar pathway . The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) indicates whether indications have been approved on the basis of extrapolation or data from comparative clinical studies . This supported approval in all the same indications as for the originator, Remicade TM . The approval of the biosimilar anti-inflammatory drugs infliximab and etanercept has significantly changed the evidence for biosimilar extrapolation and switching . For less wealthy nations, abbreviated drug development and regulatory pathways for the approval of biosimilars can cut costs and deliver affordable medicines . The following examples illustrate the problems that can arise with intended copy biologics which have not been through the regulatory scrutiny of biosimilars . The problem with intended copy biologics is that they have neither the security of biosimilarity studies nor large volumes of clinical data to predict their safety and efficacy . In this example too, an intended copy biologic was misrepresented as a biosimilar . The respected Adis Insights drug database has Reditux listed as a biosimilar (July 2017) . Safety data for a biosimilar are likely to be limited at the time of launch; however, experience to date indicates that the adverse event profiles of biosimilars match those of their originators . Clinical studies on a biosimilar prior to authorization are generally limited and, as for any new drug, post-marketing surveillance is required to enable identification of any rare adverse effects . Crucial to this will be product naming - since biosimilars and originators will share the same International Non-propriety drug name (INN) . Real-world studies . European regulation of biosimilars . The agency adapted the 'biosimilar pathway' from the existing regulatory pathway designed for reference drugs following a manufacturing change . In contrast to originator drugs, which require pivotal clinical trials to gain new approved indications, biosimilars may gain approval by extrapolating the equivalence demonstrated in one approved indication to another . Clinical studies are required for additional indications if the approved indications have different mechanisms of action (MOA) or mechanisms of toxicity (MOT) that could suggest a potential risk to drug safety or efficacy . ","The evidence required for approval of biosimilars is greater than that for generic versions of small molecule drugs. The 'biosimilar pathway' developed by the European Medicines Agency follows the principles that apply following a change to manufacturing of a biologic. Central to the pathway is the demonstration that there are no significant clinical differences between a biosimilar and its reference biologic, based on analytical, preclinical and clinical data. Based on this, and demonstration that the mechanism of action is the same in different conditions, the biosimilar will be approved for the same indications as the reference biologic - known as extrapolation. 'Intended copy' biologics manufactured in countries with less stringent regulation than the EU and USA may not be true biosimilars and clinical equivalence cannot be assumed. Safety monitoring in the EU over the 10 years since the introduction of biosimilars has not identified any relevant difference in the nature, severity or frequency of adverse effects between biosimilars and their reference medicines. While the safety data for a biosimilar may be limited at launch, comparability studies mean that the range and severity of potential adverse events can be predicted from the experience with the originator reference biologic gained over many years of clinical use. Biosimilars are subject to the same pharmacovigilance as their reference biologic, including special report requirements (black triangle; risk minimization plan)."
9781908541062,ch_10,"The development of drugs that target TNF has been an enormous advance . Macrophages appear to be the primary source of active TNF in RA, via TNF converting enzyme (TACE)-mediated cleavage of transmembrane TNF . After being shed from the cell surface, TNF molecules aggregate into trimolecular complexes that subsequently bind receptors on a variety of cells, including fibroblasts, leukocytes and endothelial cells . Adalimumab is a humanized mAb against TNF . Most recently, golimumab and certolizumab pegol have received regulatory approval for treating RA . These five TNF inhibitors show excellent effectiveness in both early and established RA . Patients who may benefit . Not all RA patients respond to TNF antagonists and, at present, there are no factors that reliably predict effectiveness . Their effectiveness approximates inversely with the duration of RA - thus they are more effective in early disease and least effective in very late disease . RA patients overall are at higher risk for serious infections than healthy peers . In RA, however, there appears to be an imbalance that favors the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-1 . Overall, its effectiveness is less than TNF antagonists and other biological therapies . In the UK, NICE has not approved its use to treat RA . B cell depletion . Rituximab is a chimeric mAb specific for CD20, a phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of mature and naive B cells but absent from B cell precursors and plasma cells . Rituximab depletes circulating B cells and produces therapeutic benefit in RA similar to that achieved with TNF antagonists . It is approved for treatment of RA patients for whom anti-TNF therapy has failed . Emerging data suggest that rituximab is more effective in RA patients with circulating autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor [RF] and/or anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies [ACPA]) . They are most common with the first dose of the first course of therapy and are probably secondary to cytokine release associated with B cell lysis . No increased risk of infections or opportunistic infections has been noted in RA patients, even after multiple courses of therapy, although there is a cumulative reduction in Ig levels, particularly IgM, with repeated cycles of therapy . Recent reports of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy in a small number of patients receiving rituximab for RA remain unexplained, although the majority of the patients were receiving or had received additional immunosuppression . Abatacept is the first approved biological therapy that alters T cell function by blocking co-stimulatory pathways between APCs and T cells . By competing with CD28 for binding to CD80 and CD86, abatacept downregulates T cell activation . Clinical trials have demonstrated abatacept to be effective in RA patients with early disease as well as in disease refractory to methotrexate and TNF blockade . IL-6 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of RA (Figure 9.4) . Tocilizumab is a humanized anti IL-6 receptor (Il-6R) mAb that neutralizes the effects of IL-6 . Several phase III trials have demonstrated clinical efficacy in RA patients at all disease stages, from early disease to anti-TNF failure . The controlled trials suggest a possible slight increase in bacterial infections, similar to other biological therapies . There is no evidence for enhanced vascular events in patients receiving tocilizumab, although this is an area of continuing research with several biological therapies . Biological therapies have provided a major boost to our therapeutic options in RA, but there remains a significant research agenda surrounding their use . Understanding why some patients do not respond to biological therapies remains a major challenge and provides opportunities for further dissection of the pathogenic mechanisms operative in RA . Now that we have nine biological therapies approved to treat RA, our major challenge over the next several years will be directed towards how to best use these in individual patients . Management - biological therapies . Combined with advances in biotechnology, this has led to the development of several biological therapies for RA . Biological therapies are produced from living cells rather than by chemical synthesis and, generally, are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or soluble derivatives of cell surface receptors . Those used to treat RA target specific molecules or receptors in the immune and/or inflammatory process (Table 9.1) . ","Nine biological therapies are now licensed for the treatment of RA. These block cytokines or their receptors (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin [IL]-1 and IL-6), deplete B cells or interfere with T cell activation. Biologics are expensive drugs, produced from living cells, that require parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. They slow joint damage more effectively than traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients vary in their response to biologics, presumably reflecting important inter-patient differences in disease pathogenesis and drug pharmacokinetics. Prolonged experience will be required to provide a true therapeutic ratio and an accurate economic evaluation of these drugs. A major research agenda relates to how to target these drugs to the patients who will derive most benefit from them (personalized medicine)."
9781908541277,ch_10,"Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening medical emergency characterized by frequent and/or prolonged epileptic seizures . With the aging of the population, it is likely that SE will become an increasingly important public health problem . Traditionally, SE is diagnosed when the patient has continuous or repeated seizure activity without regaining consciousness for more than 30 minutes . This time frame is defined on the basis of decompensatory cerebral damage after 30 minutes of seizure activity when physiological changes fail to compensate for the increase in cerebral metabolism . In practice, however, most authorities would recommend emergency antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment when a seizure has lasted more than 5-10 minutes, excluding simple febrile seizures . The most readily recognized type of SE is tonic-clonic SE, but it has been estimated that 25% of SE cases are 'non-convulsive' in nature . Depending on the electrographic changes, non-convulsive SE is subdivided into complex partial and absence SE . SE is a neurological emergency that requires immediate treatment . SE may result from a variety of causes (Table 7.1), the commonest of which include non-compliance with antiepileptic medication, consumption of alcohol, metabolic problems, acute stroke and hypoxia . Mortality and morbidity reflect the underlying cause and the physiological effects of prolonged convulsions, including hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and hyperthermia . Mortality is as high as 10%, rising to 50% in elderly patients . Mortality is higher when SE is secondary to an acute insult (exempli gratia acute stroke, anoxia, trauma, infections, metabolic disturbance) . Conversely, SE resulting from a previous stroke, alcohol or AED withdrawal has a more favorable prognosis . A long duration of SE is associated with poor outcome . An effective management protocol should therefore be initiated immediately (Table 7.2) . Any delay in treatment worsens the prognosis and reduces the likelihood of stopping seizures without having to resort to general anesthesia . The importance of a coordinated effort in the treatment of convulsive SE - involving ambulance technicians, emergency medicine specialists, medical intensivists and neurological specialists - cannot be overemphasized . If the seizure persists, the patient might be considered as having refractory SE and general anesthesia would be warranted . Table 7.3 lists the schedules for treating resistant SE, as discussed at the first London Colloquium on Status Epilepticus on behalf of the Taskforce on Status Epilepticus of the International League Against Epilepsy in 2007 . In persistent SE, it is important to watch for potential complications including hypothermia, acidosis, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, infection and cerebral edema . Treatment response should be monitored clinically and with EEG . Seizure clusters . Some patients experience clusters of seizures (also called acute repetitive seizures) lasting from minutes to hours . Patients with frontal lobe epilepsy are particularly prone to clustering of seizures at night . Seizure clustering may occur around menstruation in women, or when patients do not take their usual AED therapy . These seizure clusters may not be defined as SE but nonetheless require therapeutic intervention . Acute treatment with a benzodiazepine such as clobazam after the first seizure can be given in an attempt to prevent further attacks . If the seizure cluster has occurred as a result of AED omission or dose reduction, reintroduction of the drug may be sufficient to abort it . During a seizure cluster, oral therapy in a child may be problematic and intravenous access is usually unavailable or difficult . Rectal diazepam administered by parents or other caregivers may be effective in this situation . Rectal diazepam is absorbed more rapidly than rectal lorazepam or oral diazepam because of its high lipid solubility . Buccal midazolam, available in Europe, is being increasingly used instead of rectal diazepam . Lower amounts can be used in younger children . Nasal formulations of benzodiazepines are under development . Parents and caregivers must be adequately trained by knowledgeable healthcare professionals to be able to recognize seizure clusters, administer rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam, monitor the patient for potentially dangerous respiratory depression and summon emergency medical help when necessary . Excessive use of rectal diazepam can result in rebound seizures . ","Status epilepticus (SE) can be convulsive or non-convulsive. Emergency treatment should be given when a convulsive seizure has lasted more than 5-10 minutes. Poor prognostic factors for SE include old age, acute symptomatic cause and long duration. Benzodiazepine administration, orally or rectally, can be useful in patients experiencing clusters of seizures. Buccal midazolam is being increasingly used in place of rectal diazepam for the treatment of seizure clusters (acute repetitive seizures)."
9783318067095,ch1,"Digital medicine describes a field concerned with the use of technologies as tools for measurement and intervention in the service of human health . Digital medicine products are driven by high-quality hardware and software products that support health research and the practice of medicine broadly, including treatment, recovery, disease prevention and health promotion for individuals and across populations (Figure 1.1) . Role of products . Digital medicine products can be used independently or in concert with pharmaceuticals, biologics, devices or other products to optimize patient care and health outcomes . Patients and healthcare providers are empowered with intelligent and accessible tools to address a wide range of conditions through high-quality, safe and effective measurements and data-driven interventions . Digital products are also used in health research to develop knowledge of the fundamental determinants of health and illness by examining biological, environmental and lifestyle factors . In observational and interventional research, digital technologies are increasingly used in the prevention and treatment of disease and to support health promotion . Digital medicine focuses on evidence generation to support the use of these technologies . Intervention products include digital therapeutics and connected implantables (exempli gratia an insulin pump) . They are used independently or in concert with medications, devices or other therapies to optimize patient care and health outcomes . Digital intervention products are not the primary focus of this book, however . Combination products both measure and intervene . For example, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for people with diabetes share data from a patient automatically with their doctor's office using a companion app . Digital health . Similar to the way in which 'wellness' products differ from those used in medicine, 'digital health' differs from digital medicine . We use 'digital health' to describe products that consumers use to measure physical activity or sleep quality - things that might influence their personal wellbeing . Digital health products may include apps or wearable sensors (exempli gratia Fitbit, Oura ring) . Digital health products are intended to be consumer-facing rather than used in clinical care; they often do not produce the evidence necessary to support medical use . There are times when it may be appropriate to use consumer-grade tools for measurement in clinical research . Digital medicine product manufacturers commit to undergo rigorous randomized controlled clinical studies for their products . Unlike digital health products, digital medicine products demonstrate success in clinical trials . In this book, we outline digital products that measure and intervene in all areas of the practice of medicine, extending to and including behavioral health, public health and population health management . Digital medicine products are evidence-based tools that support health research and the practice of medicine . A key component of these systems is the transformation of raw physiological or environmental signals into health indicators that can be used to monitor and predict aspects of health and disease . Digital measurements in medicine today . Some digital measurements are already well established in routine clinical care - ambulatory EKG monitoring, for example, is used to detect arrhythmias in cardiac patients . Digital measures are also used in clinical research to better monitor patients and more efficiently assess safety and efficacy . For example, in-hospital ambulatory cardiac monitoring has existed for many years, enabling real-time monitoring of EKG signals . The digital medicine solutions for cardiac monitoring include non-obtrusive patch-based cardiac monitors that may be worn for days at a time, while ambulatory and remote from the hospital, and which send real-time signals . Some examples of products used in clinical care are described below . More sophisticated measurements can monitor in real-time if a patient is doing their rehab exercises . Real-time safety monitoring . Such monitoring often relies on wearable sensors, cameras, motion sensors, microphones and/or floor sensors . One of the thorniest problems in routine clinical care can now be measured under limited circumstances . An ingestible sensor embedded in a medication is available to monitor when a pill is taken . Multimodal data integration . By combining remotely captured data into electronic medical records (EMRs), personal health records, patient portals and clinical data repositories, innovators hope to improve clinical decision-making and support data-driven medicine . Potential applications in clinical research include the following . Articles reviewing current and prospective wearable technologies and their progress toward clinical application and the use of medical technology in the home provide additional examples of measurement in digital medicine . In chapters 3 -, we outline security, ethical, legal and regulatory considerations when adopting digital medicine technologies in clinical research and routine care (Figure 1.2) . ","Digital medicine is an emerging medical and scientific discipline concerned with the application of software and hardware to health through cycles of innovation and development of research-based evidence. Digital medicine products can be used for measurement and/or treatment, and in combination with existing diagnostics and therapeutics. Measurement using digital products may enable more continuous, more precise and less biased information than traditional means of measurement in medicine. These measurement advantages are applicable in clinical care and in the conduct of clinical research, where such measurements can be used as clinical endpoints or for other measurement and monitoring purposes such as establishing eligibility for a trial or detecting adverse effects of a treatment under study."
9783318068207,hh-4,"The last of these is caused by deamination of cytosine, resulting in a sequence change to thymidine (C:G to T:A) during PCR . NGS is not optimal for assessing repeat sequences . Those platforms utilized for sequencing very short fragments may miss large deletions (more than 20 bp) . One problem common to all platforms is loss of signal quality due to some of the molecules falling out of phase during the sequencing, with different residues being added . This results in inaccurate linking of molecules from the same sequence, so that structural variations and splicing changes could be missed . The data from sequencing give numerous signals, many of which are low quality and need to be filtered out . The effect can be negated by sequencing both strands, with a positive result only being called if both strands show the variant . Similarly, low or borderline levels need to be evaluated in the same light, depending on the depth of sequencing obtained . Developments in sequencing . Theoretically, techniques to determine single-molecule sequencing would be preferable . Third-generation sequencing methods, also termed large-fragment single-molecule sequencing, aim to sequence long DNA and RNA molecules . History of gene sequencing . Technology was developed that could generate millions of sequencing reactions per run: 'next-generation sequencing' . NGS methods . NGS technologies can be categorized into those that provide long-read sequences of up to 900 kilobase base pairs (kbp) and those that provide short-read sequences of 100-600 bp . However, this is usually not necessary, and sequencing of the exons of known genes - whole-exome sequencing (WES) - is more appropriate . In some circumstances, information is required only for a limited number of genes or for hotspots in those genes; this is known as targeted sequencing . Sequencing provides information on cancer biomarkers that may be prognostic, predictive and/or pharmacotherapeutic . Current methods of clinical NGS . Sequencing involves a common workflow, from DNA extraction, to library preparation, target enrichment, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis . DNA extraction from tumor cells can be carried out using virtually any method . All methods ultimately result in DNA fragmentation and the addition of adapters to the fragment ends . Adapters may include molecular barcodes (to allow for pooling of patient samples), a sequence recognized by universal PCR primers, hybridization sequences to bind the DNA fragments to a surface, and recognition sites to initiate sequencing . The term library refers to these DNA fragments with flanking adapters that are ready for sequencing . Target enrichment . The resulting library undergoes enrichment for specific regions of interest for whole-exome analysis and/or targeted sequencing of specific genes . Enrichment may occur by hybridization to complementary sequences (sequence capture) or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) . Sequence capture is preferred for large genomic regions and PCR for smaller regions where greater enrichment is required . Sequencing is performed using one of the two major platforms, Illumina or Ion Torrent . Illumina-based sequencing is relatively rapid as direct imaging increases the detection speed, in contrast to camera-based imaging . This can interfere with the generation of an accurate consensus sequence, thereby reducing the number of cycles that can occur . Illumina sequencing can be used for genomic sequencing, exomic and targeted sequencing, metagenomics, RNA sequencing, ChIP-seq and methylome methods . Sequential flooding and washing of a sequencing chamber with reagents containing only one of the four nucleotides at any time results in a voltage change when the specific nucleotide is incorporated . These Ion Torrent reactions occur in millions of wells on a semiconductor chip that converts the chemical reaction information into sequencing information . Advantages of NGS over older methods . Sanger sequencing is a very accurate method of sequencing that can analyze relatively large DNA fragments . All NGS platforms capture the individual sequences of millions of molecules, while standard sequencing methods (Sanger sequencing) deliver a net signal derived from a pool of molecules, a collective sequence . NGS, in contrast, can sequence multiple targets in one reaction rather than one target/reaction . As NGS sequences multiple fragments, multiple times, it has higher sensitivity and can therefore detect variants that occur at lower frequencies . NGS is far more rapid and also cheaper for sequencing multiple targets than standard methods . As NGS samples can be multiplexed, NGS has higher throughput . ","Sanger sequencing, although groundbreaking, is labor intensive, time consuming and expensive, and hence it has been replaced with NGS. The two major methods for NGS use the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms. Illumina uses fluorescently tagged nucleotides while Ion Torrent detects a pH (voltage) change on nucleotide binding. It is vital that the results of NGS are considered in a clinical context. A result from an inadequate sample should not be interpreted as a negative result. Methods of single-molecule sequencing, although relatively error prone, have utility in the sequencing of large variants and transcript isoforms."

Follicular lymphoma . Follicular lymphoma is a common, usually nodal, lymphoma with a relatively high rate of transformation to high-grade disease (Table 6.1) . It is one of the commonest forms of low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), representing 25% of all lymphoma cases . Follicular lymphoma in the bone marrow presents as a characteristic paratrabecular infiltrate . Clinical presentation . Although many patients present with painless enlargement of lymph nodes, most are found to have widespread disease after staging (see Figure 6.1) . Bone-marrow involvement is found in 60-80% of cases, and splenomegaly is also common . com/lymphoid/lymphoma/flipi2) . bone-marrow involvement . Early-stage disease . For patients with early-stage follicular lymphoma (stage IA or IIA), radiotherapy is an option . Most low-grade lymphomas are remarkably radiosensitive, so this may be the treatment of choice for patients with localized disease . In fact, some studies suggest that radiotherapy alone may be curative in about 50% of patients with early-stage disease . Advanced disease . Mantle cell lymphoma . Clinical presentation . Staging investigations usually reveal widespread disease involving the spleen, bone marrow and, not uncommonly, abnormal circulating cells in the blood . Low Ki-67 expression may be associated with this group of patients . The optimal treatment of mantle cell lymphoma is unclear . For these patients, regimens such as R-CHOP or R-bendamustine are commonly used . If these are well tolerated, patients are sometimes considered for autologous transplantation . Marginal zone lymphoma . Marginal zone lymphomas (Table 6.3) can be divided into three main subtypes . Clinical presentation . MALT lymphoma of the stomach is the most common form of marginal zone lymphoma . It mainly affects patients over 50 years of age . Most cases are associated with H . These patients tend to have widespread disease, fail to respond to H . Thyroid marginal zone lymphoma may lead to tracheal compression and stridor . Cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma, while less frequently seen, still represents one of the commonest forms of skin lymphoma . Patients with more aggressive disease or those that undergo high-grade transformation require combination immunochemotherapy such as R-CHOP . Splenectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with SLVL . There are almost no specific diagnostic markers for this disease . Distinguishing these lymphomas from marginal zone lymphomas is difficult and some authors would consider LPL a variant of marginal cell lymphoma . Clinical presentation . Relapsed disease may require combination chemotherapy, such as CHOP . Patients presenting with hyperviscosity may require urgent plasma exchange to lower the IgM level . Small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/CLL is the most common low-grade B-cell lymphoma (Table 6.5) . The disorder is usually referred to as small lymphocytic lymphoma when there is almost no 'blood spill' (spillage of lymphocytes into the peripheral blood) and the patient presents with lymphadenopathy . The malignant B cells are usually small, not much bigger than a red cell, and express CD5, CD19 and CD23 . Clinical presentation . B-cell CLL characteristically begins with a peripheral blood lymphocytosis . No treatment is necessary in the early stages of the disease . FCR is first choice for younger fitter patients who require therapy . In older patients, rituximab with chlorambucil or bendamustine is widely used . These drugs have shown significant activity in relapsed patients . CLL does not run a slow indolent course in all patients . The prognosis is variable and some patients respond poorly to chemotherapy . ","Low-grade B-cell lymphomas are more common in the elderly and treatment is usually aimed at alleviating symptoms rather than curing the disease. Some low-grade lymphomas, such as follicular and mantle cell lymphomas, have characteristic immunophenotypes and cytogenetics that enable clear diagnosis. Other low-grade lymphomas are hard to diagnose definitively because of the lack of specific markers (exempli gratia marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma). Knowledge of the cause of the lymphoma has in some cases led to improved treatments (exempli gratia Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma)."
9781908541666,ch_3,"Early detection of impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance allows early intervention with appropriate lifestyle change and can defer and even prevent the onset of diabetes . Thus, early detection plays an important role in optimizing health . Glucose levels . The diagnosis of diabetes has changed progressively over the last couple of decades; criteria have become simplified and now recognize that diabetic complications occur with glucose levels previously considered normal . The current diagnostic cut-offs are listed in Table 2.1 and reflect the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines of 2013 . Fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) is generally diagnostic of diabetes mellitus . These cut-offs establish the diagnosis of diabetes, after which it is left to the clinician to consider and determine the cause or type of diabetes . This can be determined on clinical findings and, if required, other investigations or antibody testing . Further characterization of diabetes types is discussed on Determination of type, Chapter 2 . Impaired fasting glucose . It is now recognized that a fasting glucose level between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L (100-125 mg/dL) is 'prediabetic' . Studies show these individuals are already developing diabetic complications such as microalbuminuria and are at increased cardiovascular risk . Thus, early detection is important for early intervention for complication development . Glucose tolerance testing . Glucose tolerance should be formally tested when glucose levels fall short of diagnostic cut-offs and the patient is considered 'at-risk' (Table 2.2) . A glucose tolerance test focuses on the 2-hour glucose response following a 75 g oral glucose load . The glucose load is given as a drink . Cut-offs are given in Table 2.1: essentially a 2-hour glucose response > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is diagnostic of diabetes and < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) considered normal . The glucose tolerance test is a useful provocation test that can be used for early detection of diabetes in the at-risk patient (see Table 2.2) . It is also diagnostically useful in women with impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L [100-125 mg/dL]), for whom the fasting glucose test is less sensitive for diabetes . The current ADA criteria require confirmation by repeat testing on a subsequent day . Glycated hemoglobin levels . Recent international standardization of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) has allowed this simple measure to be used for diabetes diagnosis . The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a diabetes diagnostic cut-off of >= 48 mmol/mol (>= 6.5%) . A value less than 6.5% does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests . Therefore, in these patients, the best time to screen is with a random glucose level between 15:00 and 17:00 hours . In those diagnosed with diabetes, it is important to distinguish between the different types . Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) provides a good example . It may appear identical to type 2 diabetes but be difficult to manage with standard oral medications, with patients progressing to insulin therapy . Recent studies show that early instigation of insulin therapy in this diabetes subgroup is associated with better glycemic control than use of sulfonylureas; a large randomized study is currently under way . To distinguish LADA from type 2 diabetes, detection of serum autoimmune antibodies is useful, specifically glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies and cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies (ICA) . Antibody testing should be considered if the individual with diabetes has any of the following features . strong family history of any autoimmune disease . strong family history of diabetes without obesity for which insulin therapy was required . While distinguishing LADA/type 1 from 'usual' type 2 diabetes is of significance for making therapeutic decisions, there are other types of diabetes for which choice of therapy may be influenced by the type of diabetes present . Other types of diabetes are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5 . It is also relevant to consider underlying causes of diabetes, such as hemochromatosis and rare endocrinopathies, such as Cushing's syndrome and acromegaly . Seeking appropriate clinical signs is useful . ","Screening for diabetes should be undertaken annually with a fasting glucose level. Always consider diabetes mellitus in high-risk populations, including those with a family history, the obese, corticosteroid recipients and transplantation recipients."
9781908541406,ch_12,"The incidence of venous thromboembolism increases about fourfold during normal pregnancy and is greatest in the puerperium . The platelet count declines by 10% in pregnancy, partly as a result of the increase in plasma volume . Although the platelet count declines in normal pregnancy, a fall below the lower limit of normal (150 x 10 /L) is uncommon . In about 10% of normal pregnancies, however, it falls to 100-150 x 10 /L without any coagulation disturbance or presence of other illness . This gestational or 'benign' thrombocytopenia of pregnancy is of unknown etiology and is of no clinical consequence . Babies born to mothers with this disorder have normal platelet counts . It is usually diagnosed by excluding other causes of a reduced platelet count (exempli gratia disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) . Pre-existing primary immune thrombocytopenia may be exacerbated during pregnancy, and the platelet count declines further to a level at which specific treatment may be required . The condition may also first present in pregnancy with a platelet count of less than 100 x 10 /L on routine blood examination, or with bleeding symptoms, which usually only occur when the platelet count is less than 20 x 10 /L . It is not possible to predict the cord blood platelet count in advance of delivery . Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia . Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is an uncommon condition in which maternal immunization results from small fetomaternal bleeds . Transplacental transfer of this antiplatelet immunoglobulin (Ig)G reacts with the fetal platelets and causes severe thrombocytopenia . The condition is often associated with intracranial hemorrhage in the fetus during gestation or at delivery . To manage subsequent pregnancies it should be determined whether the father is heterozygous for HPA-1A and, if so, whether a fetus in a subsequent pregnancy might possess this antigen . Pregnancy-induced hypertension . Hypertension, proteinuria and edema characterize pregnancy-induced hypertension, which is most common in primigravidas . One of the other features of pregnancy-induced hypertension is activation of the coagulation system and thrombocytopenia possibly arising secondary to endothelial damage . Following delivery of the fetus, the features of pregnancy-induced hypertension resolve quickly . Induction of labor may, therefore, be appropriate in late pregnancy if the condition is severe and unresponsive to medical management . HELLP syndrome is seen in a small percentage of patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension and is characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelets . Disseminated intravascular coagulation . The activated coagulation system in pregnancy reduces the threshold for DIC . Conditions causing the consumptive coagulopathy are listed in Table 10.1 . Clinically, the patient may present with . The fibrinogen level rises progressively during pregnancy and may be 4-6 g/L by delivery . If the patient is bleeding, it is necessary to give appropriate blood products in an attempt to restore coagulation and platelet count (see Chapter 12 Diagnosis and Treatment) . Placental abruption is the most common cause of a severe consumptive coagulopathy . The management of massive blood loss is discussed in Chapter 12 . It may take several days for coagulation to return to normal to allow evacuation of the uterus . Carriers of congenital bleeding disorders . The mother might have a reduced level of the affected clotting factor and thus a bleeding disorder potentially leading to severe postpartum hemorrhage . During pregnancy the FVIII level usually rises to within the normal range but monitoring is essential . Von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels generally rise during pregnancy, and bleeding is uncommon in patients with von Willebrand disease before delivery . Uncommon bleeding disorders . Women with the uncommon bleeding disorders described in Chapter 8 may encounter bleeding problems during and especially after pregnancy . Genotyping of both parents before pregnancy is recommended, and mothers should be tested repeatedly during pregnancy and cord blood sampled at delivery . Obstetric hemorrhage . ","In pregnancy, it is important to be aware of the complications that may be associated with severe coagulation disturbance (exempli gratia pregnancy-associated hypertension) and to monitor the blood count and coagulation screen in these patients. Before attributing a platelet count of 100 x 10 /L or less to the benign condition of gestational thrombocytopenia of pregnancy, other causes of a reduced platelet count should be excluded. In primary immune thrombocytopenia, the platelet count tends to fall as pregnancy progresses and treatment may be necessary to maintain it above about 50 x 10 /L. After delivery, the platelet count in the neonate should be monitored for about a week as it can fall profoundly in the first few days of life."
9781908541963,chapter4,"The liver is uniquely positioned, both anatomically and metabolically, to receive the brunt of potential insults; thus, medications have the potential to induce liver disease, and at least 1000 drugs have been implicated . DILI typically presents in one of three clinical patterns (Table 4.1) . These presentations are similar or even identical to liver injuries from other causes . Specific medications typically produce a specific and reproducible pattern of liver injury, referred to as the hepatotoxicity profile of the drug . Paracetamol is an example . Hepatotoxicity due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an example . Isoniazid is an example . Drugs commonly associated with hepatotoxicity . These drugs are so effective that they are in very common use . As a group the statins are very safe, with fewer than 2% of patients enrolled in clinical trials discontinuing the medications for any reason . Most patients are asymptomatic and have no signs suggestive of liver dysfunction on physical examination . Periodic monitoring of liver tests is recommended, although there is no evidence that monitoring prevents serious liver disease . The abnormalities are generally not progressive and may resolve despite continued use of the drug . Nevertheless, if significant persistent elevations in liver tests occur, the statin should be discontinued . Starting a different statin once the liver abnormalities have resolved, and monitoring the patient's liver tests for a period, is appropriate . A common clinical question is whether to use a statin in a patient with pre-existing liver disease . A retrospective study found that patients with baseline elevated aminotransferases were no more likely to develop further elevation in liver tests when taking a statin than were patients with abnormal aminotransferases who were not taking statins . Thus, it is probably acceptable to use the statins in patients with chronic stable liver disease, provided symptoms and liver tests are monitored . Statins are contraindicated in patients with acute liver disease and those with advanced chronic liver disease (elevated bilirubin, depressed albumin, clinically apparent cirrhosis, etc . Lower doses, typically used without suicidal intent, can induce severe liver injury in patients who chronically use alcohol or who are malnourished . In these patients, doses within the therapeutic range (id est about 4 g) may be hepatotoxic . The clinical and laboratory abnormalities usually reach their peak by 3-4 days . Patients with intersects below the line in the nomogram are at little risk for hepatotoxicity . Activated charcoal should be given when the patient presents within 8 hours of ingestion . N -acetylcysteine is the definitive treatment for paracetamol overdose . It is therefore imperative that N -acetylcysteine is given early (typically while awaiting paracetamol serum levels) and continued if significant hepatotoxicity has developed . If the nomogram suggests little chance of hepatotoxicity, N -acetylcysteine can be discontinued . The development of progressive liver failure with encephalopathy mandates the transfer of the patient to a liver transplant center . Two types of hepatotoxicity are recognized . This occurs in approximately 20% of patients, who remain asymptomatic . Isoniazid should be continued and the patient monitored for symptoms and worsening liver tests . Often the liver test abnormalities will resolve despite continuing isoniazid . Clinically evident isoniazid hepatitis, the second and much more serious form, is rare, occurring in less than 1% of treated patients . About half of patients with clinical isoniazid hepatitis will develop symptoms within a few months of starting the drug, although presentations after as long as 12 months have been reported . Isoniazid should be stopped immediately and the patient observed closely . At a minimum, patients who start taking isoniazid should be educated to recognize and report any symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction . Patients with symptoms should be evaluated promptly and thoroughly . Guidelines for monitoring asymptomatic patients for hepatotoxicity vary . The US Centers for Disease Control recommend liver tests before treatment and then periodically during treatment only in patients at high risk for hepatotoxicity (Table 4.2) . Others, reasoning that concomitant use of other drugs with hepatotoxic potential (rifampicin [rifampin] and pyrazinamide) is so common, recommend liver tests at regular intervals . ","Drug-induced liver injury is common and usually mild. Determining the temporal relationship between starting a drug and the development of symptoms and signs of liver disease is important. Discontinuation of offending agents usually results in prompt resolution of hepatic injury. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be appropriate for some medications, such as statins and isoniazid."
9781908541062,ch_2,"The synovial membrane intima is just one or two cell layers thick and contains two major cell types: type A synoviocytes, which bear macrophage markers, and type B synoviocytes, which have fibroblastic characteristics . The matrix of the intima is rich in proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, in particular hyaluronic acid . Synovial fluid . Articular cartilage . Articular cartilage comprises chondrocytes embedded in a hydrated matrix composed of collagen, proteoglycans and other matrix proteins . It is an avascular structure lacking lymphatics, and the synovial fluid is critical for providing nutrients to this tissue . These cells are critical to the integrity of articular cartilage because they synthesize collagen, proteoglycans and also other components such as fibronectin . Each cell is surrounded by a zone of secreted proteoglycans and a basket-like mantle of fibrillar collagen, but the highest collagen content occurs in the more distal intercellular matrix . Collagens are fibrillar proteins that, together with proteoglycans, account for the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage . There are 14 different types of collagen, divided into three major groups . The predominant collagen in articular cartilage is type II, constituting approximately 90% in the adult, with types IX and XI contributing most of the remainder . All collagens are based on a triple helical structure (Figure 1.2), and the differences between collagens relate to the length of the triple helix, the presence of non-collagenous units within the molecule that impart extra flexibility, or the addition of non-collagenous side-chains such as carbohydrates . The triple helical structure of collagens accounts for their tensile strength . Collagen biosynthetic and degradative pathways are quite well characterized . The largest family of proteoglycans in articular cartilage is the aggrecans, which contain abundant chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate side-chains . They are complexed with hyaluronic acid and so-called link protein . Their main function relates to their anionic and water-trapping properties, which provide deformability and compressibility . Breakdown of collagen and the surrounding matrix is mediated by enzymes such as collagenase, gelatinase, stromelysin and aggrecanase, which are zinc-dependent metalloproteinases . Thus, tissue homeostasis is maintained by carefully balanced synthetic and catabolic pathways . Subchondral bone . The basal layer of articular cartilage is calcified and is attached directly to subchondral bone, which has a similar structure . Collagen I comprises most of the collagen present in bone, however, and is calcified with hydroxyapatite . This provides bone with both tensile and compressive strength . The remaining bone matrix is made up of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid, and proteins such as osteocalcin; as in articular cartilage, these are incorporated into macromolecular complexes . Glycoproteins such as osteopontin, osteonectin and bone sialoproteins function as anchoring molecules, bridging matrix constituents such as collagen to bone cells . Bone also contains important growth factors such as IGF-1 and 2, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) which are members of the TGFbeta superfamily . Formation and destruction . Bone contains two major cell types: osteoblasts and osteoclasts . Mesenchymal osteoblasts are critical for the synthesis of collagen and bone matrix (osteoid) . Conversely, osteoclasts - multinucleate cells of macrophage lineage - break down bone via a combination of lysosomal enzymes and low pH . Bone is constantly remodeled to fulfill two major functions . To optimize load-bearing capacity, bone is remodeled according to compressive forces acting upon it . Bone remodeling also plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis, particularly of calcium and magnesium . In young adults, bone formation and destruction are carefully balanced to maintain overall bone mass . Bone density measurements using dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), ultrasound or quantitative CT (qCT) provide surrogate measures of bone strength and fracture risk . ","The joint is a complex organ composed of a number of specialized tissues. Dysregulation within any one of the tissues within the joint may precipitate specific pathologies, such as osteoarthritis or osteoporosis. In rheumatoid arthritis, the primary pathological target is the synovial membrane."
9781908541024,ch_5,"Symptomatic management can result in a significant improvement in quality of life for patients with brain metastases . Dexamethasone is the corticosteroid most often used . All patients on prolonged corticosteroids should receive prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . Eliminating doses given late in the day and minimizing multiple daily doses may help to limit the side effects . Anticonvulsants are indicated for any patient presenting with a seizure . Prophylactic anticonvulsants have not been shown to be effective and therefore only complicate patient management, increasing the risk of medication-related side effects . Radiotherapy and surgery . Standard therapy for a patient with newly diagnosed brain metastasis remains whole-brain radiotherapy . A total dose of 3000 cGy is administered in ten daily doses of 300 cGy . About 50% of patients die from progressive neurological disease; the remainder die as a result of systemic tumor progression . Aggressive focused management of brain metastases may improve the prognosis for some patients . In this patient group, the median survival with either of these approaches is 8-9 months . These results, while encouraging, have been obtained in highly selected patient populations, most of whom had a high Karnofsky performance status, limited systemic tumor burden and small brain metastases . Such patients have an inherently better prognosis, and consequently these results may not be easily extrapolated to all patients . (The Karnofsky performance status is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores meaning a patient is better able to carry out daily activities . While early whole-brain radiotherapy improves local control, there is no clear survival benefit . Use of chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is generally disappointing . Unfortunately, by the time most patients develop brain metastases, they have already been exposed to the most effective chemotherapeutic agents and the metastatic clones are relatively chemoresistant . In spite of this, chemotherapy may be useful in treating some individuals with brain metastases . Newly diagnosed patients who are chemotherapy naïve and neurologically asymptomatic may respond favorably to systemic chemotherapy . In particular, patients with brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer or choriocarcinoma may have a better than average response to chemotherapy . A European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study found a significant survival advantage for patients with small-cell lung cancer treated with teniposide in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy, when compared with teniposide alone . Similarly, a significant improvement in radiographic response was seen in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases who were treated with temozolomide in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy, when compared with whole-brain radiotherapy alone . Finally, chemotherapy may be useful in the setting of recurrent brain metastases . At recurrence, most patients have multiple lesions that are not amenable to radiosurgery or focal therapy . Furthermore, the majority have active and often symptomatic systemic tumors . This clinical scenario makes palliative chemotherapy an appropriate intervention . Brain metastases . Improvements in therapy for systemic cancer have increased the number of patients living long enough to develop symptomatic brain metastases . Indeed, brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumor . In particular, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive (Her2+) breast cancer patients with systemic disease controlled with trastuzumab appear to have an increased risk of developing brain metastases . Thus, the development of new strategies to prevent and treat brain metastases is increasingly important . Approximately 1 in 4 patients with cancer will develop a brain metastasis; patients with melanoma, lung or breast cancer are at the greatest risk (Table 4.1) . Most patients present with headaches or focal neurological deficits; 20% or more present with or develop seizures . There is often significant surrounding edema . Patients with a new diagnosis of brain metastasis should be systemically restaged as appropriate for their primary tumor . The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has delineated specific prognostic categories for patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases (Table 4.2) . These may be helpful in determining appropriate treatment options and long-term plans (exempli gratia hospice care) for individual patients . A treatment algorithm for newly diagnosed brain metastasis is shown in Figure 4.4 . ","Improvements in therapy for systemic cancer have resulted in an increase in the number of patients living long enough to develop symptomatic brain metastasis. It is likely that this trend will continue. Therefore, new strategies to prevent and treat brain metastases will become increasingly important. Patients with a new diagnosis of brain metastasis should be systemically restaged as appropriate for their primary tumor. Although the average prognosis for an individual with brain metastasis is poor, selected patients will benefit significantly from aggressive local therapy or judicious use of chemotherapy."
9781908541406,ch_8,"Some female carriers of the hemophilic gene, however, have reduced plasma levels of FVIII and FIX, and consequently have a mild bleeding disorder . Hemophilia A is about five times more common than hemophilia B . Molecular genetics of hemophilia A and B . The causative mutations for hemophilia A and B are found in the genes for FVIII and FIX, respectively . A large number of different mutations have been described that result in varying reductions in FVIII/FIX activity . For individuals not diagnosed at birth, the age at which the patient clinically presents with a bleed will usually depend on the severity of the hemophilia . Those with severe hemophilia usually experience their first bleed at about 6-9 months of age, when they start to become mobile and hemarthroses occur . Many bleeds in patients with severe hemophilia are apparently 'spontaneous', without a history of trauma, and occur as often as once or twice a week . Boys with moderate (1-5% factor levels) or mild (> 5%) hemophilia usually present with bleeding episodes later, the age depending on the FVIII or FIX level . Those with moderate hemophilia bleed after minor trauma, while those with mild hemophilia usually only bleed after major trauma or surgery . Sites of bleeding . The most common sites for bleeds are large joints: for example, the knees, elbows, ankles, hips and shoulders . The individual is usually aware that a bleed is starting before there are any signs of swelling or limitation of movement . Untreated bleeding continues until the joint is tense, swollen and exceedingly painful . Muscle atrophy around the joint leads to instability and further predisposes to bleeding . Unless treated early and effectively, several bleeds into a joint will weaken it considerably (Figure 6.2) . Muscle hematomas are also characteristic of hemophilia . Bleeding often begins insidiously and may have been occurring for some time before discomfort is noticed; as a result, a patient may eventually present with a large hematoma . Even minor trauma can precipitate hemorrhage, and occasionally bleeds occur spontaneously . Bleeding is usually into the substance of the cerebrum . In an undiagnosed patient with hemophilia, bleeding may not be excessive during an operation, but persistent oozing over several days leads to a large hematoma . Treatment should be continued until bleeding has stopped . Further treatment may be necessary to prevent recurrent bleeding during mobilization and physiotherapy . Treatment can be problematic in those patients with higher levels of antibody, because the infused FVIII is immediately neutralized and consequently therapy is ineffective . These treatments are not, however, as effective as FVIII in a patient without an inhibitor . Inhibitors are rare in patients with hemophilia B . Female carriers of hemophilia A and B can be identified from the family history alone . Alternatively, intragenic FVIII/FIX polymorphisms can be used to track the hemophilia gene in the family . If the fetus is diagnosed as having hemophilia, a termination can be offered . Infections transmitted by clotting factor concentrates . From the late 1970s until 1986, HIV contaminated clotting factor concentrates, which resulted in the infection of many patients . It was observed that those who required the most frequent injections of concentrate (id est patients with severe hemophilia) were at greatest risk of infection . About 60% of patients with severe hemophilia in the UK and 95% of those in the USA became infected with HIV, and virtually all patients who received concentrate also became infected with HCV . Treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin cures up to 50% of patients with HCV infection . Newer drugs under development offer the possibility of effective treatment for all patients with HCV . Unlike congenital hemophilia, patients present with extensive subcutaneous bruising, compartment syndromes and genito- or gastrointestinal bleeding (bleeding into joints is very rare) . Treatment depends on the level of the inhibitory antibody and the severity of the bleeding; recombinant FVIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrates are generally more effective than FVIII and desmopressin . ","Repeated hemarthroses lead to joint destruction and it is therefore important to treat every bleed early and effectively. Children with severe hemophilia should be treated with regular prophylactic injections of factor (F)VIII or FIX concentrate to prevent bleeding and preserve joint function. All licensed concentrates of FVIII and FIX, purified from pooled blood donor plasma, are virally attenuated, do not transmit HIV or hepatitis C virus and are safe and effective therapies. Recombinant clotting factor concentrates are being used increasingly as they are virally safe and equally effective. Patients should be tested regularly for the presence of inhibitors, and any patient who does not respond clinically to treatment with factor concentrate should be immediately tested for an inhibitory antibody. In mild hemophilia A, desmopressin can often be effective and avoids the use of concentrate. All potential carriers of hemophilia A and B should be offered genetic counseling and, if appropriate, DNA testing to ascertain their carrier status."
9781910797587,chp05,"Formal consensus-agreed criteria for OA of different joints have been developed by the American College of Rheumatology (Figures 5.1 - 5.3) . When investigating a new patient presenting with any joint problems, it is usual to try to differentiate OA from primary inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . The occupational and social history is often useful in determining the 'lifetime load' to which a patient's joints have been exposed . Issues related to diagnoses of the specific joint region are discussed later in this chapter . Assessment of joint pain and its consequences . Pain is a complex and personal experience, but some effort should be made to assess pain severity . People with OA report many different patterns of pain: for example, worse with weight-bearing, worse after prolonged sitting, or predominant night pain . Even night pain is complex and may be reported as pain after getting into bed that eases off, pain when the knees bump against each other that wakes the individual, or a deep-seated pain that wakes the individual . The pathological significance of these different pains is unclear, but it may be that different treatments are required . Of course, any history of newly occurring night pain, especially in a young patient, should prompt a search for bony tumors . Many patients presenting with OA may have had symptoms for a long time . Assessment of quality of life . Some assessment of functional limitations associated with the particular joint disorder is required . Importantly, the effect of joint pain on occupation should be noted . As mentioned previously, many people with OA of one joint will have pain in other joint areas . General inspection of the individual joint will include observation of gait and looking for previous surgical scars or joint deformity . Examination findings in the OA joint may include . tenderness (most marked over the joint line) . The following sections highlight important points in the examination of individual joints . Prolonged hand pain of any cause will result in poor grip strength . The symptom of groin pain tends to be specific to the hip joint . Patients with early OA in the hip normally lose internal rotation first, with later loss of external rotation . Patellofemoral joint pain and crepitus can also be elicited by asking the patient to perform a half-squat . They may be asymptomatic or present with . difficulties in completely flexing the joint . aching and tenderness posterior to the knee after exercise . In general, the diagnosis of OA is based on clinical history and examination; since this disease generally presents with symptoms, these should be addressed first . Primarily, the task force concluded that imaging is not required for the diagnosis of typical presentations of OA (id est patients over 40 years old who present with usage-related pain, short duration morning stiffness, and symptoms in one or more joints) . Although MRI has improved our understanding of the pathology and causes of pain in OA, it has no role in the routine assessment of the OA joint . Aspiration of small joints in such cases may be aided by ultrasound guidance . The major differential diagnosis for multiple hand small-joint pain and swelling is between RA and OA with secondary inflammation . Generally, the absence of prolonged morning stiffness and the examination findings of bony deformities suggest an OA problem, but rheumatologic opinion may be required . However, pain at the base of the thumb (the first carpometacarpal joint) with local wrist pain can be difficult to distinguish from carpal tunnel syndrome, and sometimes the conditions coexist . Polyarticular gout can sometimes complicate OA of small joints . In the person with longstanding rotator cuff pathology or other trauma, true glenohumeral OA may be present . Many patients believe that hip pain occurs on the outer lateral aspect of the thigh and this is commonly what presents as 'hip pain' . Patients with true hip disease often have difficulty putting on shoes and socks . pain radiating down the outside of the thigh to the knee . True hip OA may often have an element of trochanteric bursitis as well . At the knee . The differential diagnosis of problems with the first metatarsophalangeal joint is most often between OA, a bunion and gout . One of the biggest problems with forefoot diagnoses is the co-presentation of different problems . ",Careful history taken together with clinical examination of joints establishes most diagnoses. Imaging and laboratory investigations may occasionally aid the assessment process. Differential diagnosis from other rheumatologic conditions and inflammatory arthritides is part of the diagnostic process.
9781912776818,hh-7,"Delays in initiating treatment have been associated with early mortality . Therefore, the initial management for a patient with suspected TTP will typically involve empiric plasma exchange therapy, which should usually be started before the diagnosis is confirmed . Plasma exchange therapy . The introduction of plasma exchange therapy revolutionized the treatment of TTP . It remains the mainstay of acute TTP treatment . Nearly 90% of patients will survive an acute TTP episode with plasma exchange therapy whereas, in contrast, there was near uniform mortality prior to the discovery of its effectiveness in TTP . Because of this, it is imperative to start plasma exchange as soon as possible . Plasma exchange should be continued until disease response is achieved; response is defined as a platelet count above 150 x 10 /L for two consecutive days . The expected response to plasma exchange would be a gradual decline in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) followed by an increase in platelet count . This provides reassurance that the patient is responding well to therapy . A clinical response (platelet count > 150 x 10 /L) would be expected 4-6 days after starting plasma exchange therapy . In the absence of convincing data, the most effective method of stopping plasma exchange has been debated . It is hypothesized that glucocorticoids suppress antibody inhibitors of ADAMTS13 and thus may be an effective adjunct to plasma exchange . There are, however, no randomized controlled trials that compare the efficacy of plasma exchange plus steroids with plasma exchange alone . Steroid treatments are typically continued throughout plasma exchange therapy . Once plasma exchange is completed and clinical response is achieved, steroids should be tapered and discontinued over 3-4 weeks . Rituximab has been used increasingly in recent years as more data have accumulated to demonstrate its efficacy in patients with refractory or relapsing TTP . It is typically given immediately after plasma exchange to minimize its clearance by the procedure . Caplacizumab was approved by both European Union and US regulatory authorities for the treatment of TTP in conjunction with plasma exchange and immune suppression . This provides effective protection from recurrence for the patient until immunosuppressive therapy can improve the patient's ADAMTS13 activity . Supportive care during acute episodes . During the acute phase, complete blood count (CBC) and LDH should be monitored daily to help judge the response to immunosuppressive and plasma exchange therapy . Platelet transfusions should not be routinely used in patients with TTP; they should only be considered in cases of significant clinical bleeding . Disease-response definitions . Treatment for refractory TTP should be tailored, based on response to initial therapy, but consideration should be given to . increasing the frequency of plasma exchange to twice daily . Acute treatment . Patients with cTTP do not have an ADAMTS13 autoantibody that needs to be removed, and therefore plasma exchange is not required . Some individuals with cTTP may require only intermittent plasma infusions to treat acute episodes, while others may require ongoing prophylactic therapy to prevent symptoms and treat ongoing microangiopathic findings . Patients are infused daily until the platelet count recovers to normal, which may require only 1-3 days of plasma infusion . Patients with cTTP may have complete resolution of symptoms after plasma infusion . Chronic treatment . Patients with cTTP with ongoing TTP activity may need to be maintained on prophylactic plasma infusions to prevent persistent TMA findings and treat symptoms . Prophylactic therapy with plasma infusions is often a lifetime commitment . This therapy is appropriate to continue if patients benefit from improved symptoms after plasma infusion . Prophylactic therapy requires the patient to have intravenous access and increases patient burden in travel time and costs, as well as potential transfusion reactions . Therefore, offering patients the alternative of close monitoring for symptoms without treatment is sometimes appropriate . These patients may avoid the time commitment and potential complications associated with long-term plasma infusion therapy . Even if the platelet count is above 150 x 10 /L, individuals may still have symptoms attributed to TTP that resolve with treatment with plasma infusions . Patients should be immediately started on plasma infusion therapy if they experience unexplained neurological findings or thrombocytopenia . With appropriate guidance and therapy, women can have healthy and successful pregnancies . Recombinant ADAMTS13 therapy . ","In patients presenting with a clinical picture consistent with an acute episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), plasma exchange should be started empirically before the diagnosis is confirmed by ADAMTS13 activity testing. Glucocorticoid therapy to suppress the production of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies is an important adjunct to plasma exchange therapy. Rituximab has an increasing role in the treatment of refractory and chronic relapsing TTP and may prevent future episodes by correcting the deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity. The development of caplacizumab as an adjunct to plasma exchange therapy has been shown to decrease the number of plasma exchange procedures required to achieve a normal platelet count and significantly decrease the risk for exacerbations of TTP. Many patients with congenital TTP require chronic plasma infusions as well as careful observations for chronic neurological and vascular complications."
9781908541062,ch_9,"If the disease did not significantly improve with these simple treatments, then more potent DMARDs were added . It is now clear, however, that effective therapy early in the course of RA results in a long-term reduction in joint damage compared to delayed therapy, the so-called window of opportunity . The currently approved non-biological drugs for treating RA are listed in Table 8.1 . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . NSAIDs remain one of the most frequently prescribed class of drugs in the treatment of patients with RA, at least early in the disease process . The major effect of these agents is to reduce joint pain and improve joint function . They are rarely, if ever, treatment for RA in isolation and without DMARD therapy . Corticosteroids have a long history in the treatment of many rheumatic diseases and they are still a key element in the management of RA . Therapy is often initiated in patients with active disease while awaiting the full therapeutic effect of DMARDs . Recent clinical trials have confirmed the ability of corticosteroids to rapidly control inflammation in patients with recent-onset RA when used in combination with DMARD therapy . Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs . All patients with RA are candidates for DMARD therapy, initiated at the time of diagnosis . DMARDs lack an analgesic effect, and can take weeks to months to provide clinical benefit . When used as monotherapy they may only moderate the disease process, without completely suppressing inflammation . In this way inflammation is effectively suppressed, regardless of the drugs used to achieve it, with minimization of joint damage . NICE guidance for the management of early RA is shown in Table 8.3 . Hydroxychloroquine (200-400 mg daily) is often used in early mild disease and as background therapy when another DMARD is started . This is extremely rare with hydroxychloroquine, but it is recommended that patients undergo an ophthalmology examination before starting therapy and at intervals thereafter . Methotrexate has become the most commonly used DMARD for RA as a result of its favorable efficacy/toxicity profile and low cost . More than 50% of patients taking methotrexate continue the drug for more than 5 years, which is longer than for any other DMARD . Despite its effectiveness, the precise mechanism of action of methotrexate in RA remains uncertain . The usual dose ranges from 15 to 25 mg once weekly . Use of methotrexate in patients with renal insufficiency or on dialysis should be avoided . Guidelines for monitoring patients with RA while on methotrexate have been established by a number of bodies . Side effects . It is frequently used in combination with other DMARDs . Side effects . Side effects . Gold compounds, because of their effectiveness in suppressing synovitis, were the most popular disease-modifying agents in the 1970s and early 1980s . An initial test dose of 10 mg should be administered before starting weekly therapy at 50 mg . The dosing interval can be increased once an effect is established . Side effects . In RA it is effective as monotherapy and as an adjunct to methotrexate . Cytotoxic drugs, including azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, are generally reserved for patients with refractory RA who have failed conventional therapy . The optimal timing of, and potential benefit to be gained from, orthopedic surgery in the RA patient requires skilled judgment . Similarly, both local and systemic disease activity must be optimally controlled perioperatively . Rheumatologists today initiate disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy as soon as the diagnosis of RA is secure . Subsequently, therapy is aggressively adjusted until a state of low disease activity or remission is achieved . Early control of inflammation and the disease process is essential to minimize irreversible joint damage and functional disability . Most patients will commence therapy with methotrexate, either alone or ideally in combination with other DMARDs . With aggressive DMARD therapy a proportion of patients will achieve disease remission, and those who do not can now receive biological therapies (see Chapter 9) within a few months of diagnosis . The patient must be fully educated about treatment options and expectations from the outset, and decisions regarding drug therapy must be mutually agreed . Furthermore, the rheumatologist must serve as an advocate for the patient with regard to treatment and drug monitoring programs . ","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief but should almost never be used in isolation. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of pharmacological therapy, and their use in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reduces long-term irreversible joint damage. Treatment-to-target strategies, including combination DMARD therapy, rapidly suppress inflammation and minimize long-term damage and disability. DMARDs are generally safe with appropriate monitoring, but adverse events are potentially life-threatening if missed. Optimal therapy also includes access to allied health professionals such as nurse specialists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and podiatrists. The need for, and timing of, surgery requires skilled judgment. Consequently, the patient with RA is optimally managed from disease onset by a rheumatologist and their multidisciplinary team."
9781908541468,ch_6,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and underrecognized . In the UK, 9% of the population (approximately 2 million individuals) have CKD stages 1-4 with about 20000 patients on dialysis . The incidence of CKD leading to dialysis varies worldwide; the number of patients per million population starting dialysis each year is 300 in the USA compared with 230 in Japan and 110 in the UK . The three most important causes of CKD are diabetes, glomerulonephritis and hypertension (and other vascular disease), but the primary cause does vary geographically (Figure 4.1) . CKD usually presents with non-specific symptoms caused by kidney failure and the underlying disease, or is discovered by chance following a routine blood or urine test . Recognition of abnormal kidney function is the key to the diagnosis of CKD . CKD is generally a progressive disease (Figure 4.2), though the rate of decline in kidney function varies between patients . blood pressure . The management of CKD is summarized in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 . Evidence suggests that for patients with CKD and albuminuria the target blood pressure should be between 125/75 mmHg and 130/80 mmHg, whereas in patients with CKD but no albuminuria, aiming for a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mmHg is recommended . Combining both an ACE inhibitor and an ARB is no longer recommended for most patients . For patients on dialysis, the most important factor in controlling blood pressure is to control salt (and water) intake and body fluid volume . A full discussion of hypertension and kidney disease can be found in Chapter 5 . Patients should also be vaccinated against hepatitis B early in CKD, when the immune response is better preserved . CKD leads to a variety of complications, which can all cause considerable morbidity (Table 4.4) . One of the major aims of care in patients with CKD is to minimize these complications, even if the underlying renal disease cannot be treated . Many complications are common to both CKD and patients established on dialysis . There is a strong association between anemia and risk of death in ESKD, and an association with increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD . The decision to treat patients with more severe anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) with an ESA should be individualized . Preventing blood transfusions, especially in patients who are candidates for kidney transplantation, is an acceptable reason for ESA treatment . Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with CKD, and cardiovascular mortality is doubled in patients with a GFR below 70 mL/minute (id est quite moderate renal impairment) . In general, the management of cardiovascular disease is similar in patients with and without kidney disease . Patients with CKD undergoing angiography should be protected from contrast nephropathy by hydration . Metabolic bone disease . A number of factors contribute to metabolic bone disease (Table 4.8) . Osteodystrophy develops at a relatively early stage of kidney failure, when the GFR falls below 30-40 mL/minute, and all patients with ESKD develop some manifestations of bone disease . Symptoms of metabolic bone disease include pruritus and bone and joint pain . Patients need comprehensive advice about low-phosphate diets, and usually need to take phosphate binders with meals to reduce absorption of dietary phosphate . (Historically, aluminum salts were given, until it was recognized that aluminum itself caused neurological damage, anemia and bone disease . Some patients require parathyroidectomy if all else fails . Dialysis amyloid is a complication that affects all patients who have been on dialysis for over 20 years . Patients with ESKD are often almost anuric and must therefore watch their fluid intake carefully . This is particularly a problem for patients on hemodialysis . Malnutrition is a particularly important problem in ESKD, and affects 40-50% of patients (Table 4.9) . Sexual dysfunction is extremely common in patients with CKD . The side effects of psychotropic drugs are often increased in kidney failure . Social support is therefore immensely important and increases survival . The epidemic of chronic kidney disease . Much of this CKD is due to type 2 diabetes and to hypertension, but there are also unknown causes of kidney failure . ","Chronic kidney disease is very common, especially the early stages. Early interventions can prevent a progressive decline in kidney function and complications. Blood pressure control is crucial, and very low targets should be set. Cardiovascular risk factors need aggressive management. Anemia and bone disease may require treatment before dialysis is necessary."
9781910797617,chp3,"This chapter provides an overview of this standard therapeutic approach and illustrates the complexity of treatment decisions in weighing benefit versus risk in patients with different risk status . Standard treatment . The standard treatment course for patients with newly diagnosed AML is . Standard induction chemotherapy . CR is achieved 4-5 weeks after initiating induction chemotherapy in 60-70% of patients . However, all patients require some form of consolidation therapy following achievement of CR to prevent disease recurrence . Treatment for patients who do not achieve CR after at least two cycles of induction chemotherapy (refractory or relapsed disease) is discussed on page 45 . Enasidenib is discussed under the treatment of relapsed disease on page 47 . Early trials suggested efficacy in a particularly poor-risk subset of patients with therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes . The treatment effect appears to be seen in patients with more favorable risk . Clinical trials with GO in a different patient population were also successful . Survival benefit was observed in subsets of patients with favorable- and intermediate-risk cytogenetics but not in those with adverse-risk cytogenetics . Patients are estimated to have 10 leukemic cells at diagnosis, which intensive induction chemotherapy reduces by 4-5 orders of magnitude (logs) . For patients who achieve first CR (CR1) following intensive induction chemotherapy, the options for consolidation therapy are . intensive high-dose (non-myeloablative) chemotherapy . It is important to note that younger favorable-risk patients have worse outcomes when doses below 1000 mg/m are used for consolidation . Many physicians, however, still prefer higher doses of AraC at least for younger, favorable-risk patients . AlloHCT should not be used initially for patients in the favorable-risk cytogenetic group as these patients respond well to consolidation with conventional non-myeloablative chemotherapy . However, it can be considered for patients in this group if their disease relapses and after a second CR is achieved . Expanded use of RIC for older AML patients may improve access to HCT and improve outcomes for this particularly high-risk subset . AutoHCT for patients in CR1 has largely fallen out of practice in the USA, although it may still provide a reasonable option for selected patients . Treatment selection . In the intermediate-risk group, which constitutes 40-50% of patients with AML, the options in CR1 are less clearly defined . Induction in older and physically 'unfit' patients . Treatment of relapsed and refractory disease . Induction chemotherapy fails to induce remission in a proportion of patients . The prognosis of these patients remains poor despite salvage chemotherapy and alloHCT . AlloHCT for patients not in remission may be considered for younger, fit patients with primary refractory AML . New treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory disease . IDH2 mutations occur in approximately 12% of patients with AML, particularly in older adults with a normal karyotype . Moreover, patients who did not achieve objective CR also benefited, with reduced transfusion needs and stable disease for a median of 9.6 months . Median OS was 19.7 months in patients who achieved CR . Ongoing studies are combining enasidenib with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of AML . Patients received 3 mg/m² GO monotherapy on days 1, 4 and 7 . Patients with APL have an excellent prognosis; greater than 85% of patients are cured . With initial therapy, nearly all patients with APL who survive induction go on to achieve remission . ATRA/ATO was superior to ATRA/idarubicin and is now the standard of care for such patients . CR rates in low-risk disease approach 100%, with excellent long-term survival . Patients with high-risk APL (due to high leukocyte count) were not included in this study . High-risk patients are at increased risk for death during induction because of this syndrome, as well as increased frequency of hemorrhagic complications (related to DIC) . For patients treated with ATRA and chemotherapy, ATO may be incorporated into post-remission therapy to reduce relapse and/or toxicity, especially for high-risk patients . In high-risk patients, sequential monitoring for the PML-RARA gene during CR1 is considered standard . ","Historically, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) adopted a 'one way fits all' approach, using induction chemotherapy to kill large numbers of leukemic cells. In individualized consolidation therapy, the same effect is achieved with either repeated intensive non-myeloablative chemotherapy or, for eligible patients, allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Treatment is strongly influenced by a patient's cytogenetic/molecular risk profile, and is informed by other factors, such as age, fitness and the response to induction chemotherapy; it is therefore highly individualized. Whilst the outlook for younger adults (< 60 years) has gradually improved over recent years, the outlook for older patients remains dismal. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) therapy has high cure rates but early death rates remain an issue for patients presenting with a high white blood cell count. Midostaurin inhibits several tyrosine kinases, including FLT3, which is constitutively activated in about 30% of patients with AML, usually because of an internal tandem duplication ( FLT3 -ITD). It is indicated for use in combination with standard induction chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with FLT3 -ITD. Enasidenib inhibits aberrant isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) which catalyzes formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. IDH2 mutations occur in approximately 12% of AML patients, particularly in older adults with normal karyotype. Enasidenib is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with the IDH2 mutation. The anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been approved for first-line treatment of AML, following modifications to the dosage and schedule in order to address the safety concerns that arose following its initial approval. It is also approved for relapsed AML (including in pediatric patients); both indications are with a reduced fractionated dose schedule. Clinical trials focusing on small, genetically similar subsets are becoming the norm; success with molecular targeted therapies approved in 2017 is likely to herald a shift towards a more targeted, individualized approach. All patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation."
9781908541727,ch08,"The eyes may be affected by certain systemic diseases or medications . Eye problems may even be the first presentation of a systemic disease or a drug's side effect . This chapter summarizes the medical conditions and systemic medications most likely to affect the eyes . The best time to detect and treat serious diabetic retinopathy is before the patient develops blurred vision . Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Proliferative diabetic retinopathy . Abnormal new blood vessels grow from the optic disc or retinal veins into the vitreous jelly (Figure 8.3), and can cause blindness from severe vitreous hemorrhage or by causing traction retinal detachment . Hypertensive patients do not require specific eye screening for this condition in the way that diabetic patients do . Although the presence of hypertensive retinopathy is a useful indication that marked hypertension has been present for some time, it does not usually cause vision problems in itself . Changes due to severe accelerated hypertension include disc swelling, retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates and macular edema . Patients who suffer from a retinal vein occlusion usually complain of sudden loss of vision, or a sudden onset of a visual field defect that affects one eye at a time . Systemic medication and the eye . When patients present with an eye problem that has no apparent cause, it is worth considering whether the condition could be caused by a systemic medication they are taking . Some of the key culprits are highlighted below in a brief 'A-Z' overview of systemic drugs and their effects on the eye . Amiodarone commonly causes vortex keratopathy (a whorl-like pattern on the surface of the cornea) . The corneal changes are usually asymptomatic but, rarely, the drug can cause optic neuropathy . Referral is indicated if vision is affected . Tricyclic antidepressants (exempli gratia amitriptyline) may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil and blocking the draining of aqueous humor in the eye . Symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma include severe eye pain and headache, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision and colored haloes around bright lights (see Fast Facts: Glaucoma) . Amitriptyline can also cause dry eye and difficulty with focusing . Amphetamines may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil . Catecholamines (adrenaline/noradrenaline, ephedrine) may cause pupillary dilation and angle closure glaucoma . They are also used to prevent and treat malaria . Hydroxychloroquine in particular is a relatively safe drug and retinal toxicity is only seen in patients who receive large doses over many years . Digitalis/digoxin can cause glare symptoms, and some patients taking this medication see haloes around light . Over-dosage can cause vision to become yellowish . These patients should be referred for evaluation of digoxin blood levels . Ethambutol and/or isoniazid is an antituberculosis (anti-TB) medication that may cause optic nerve toxicity . This can cause loss of visual acuity and difficulty seeing certain colors . Isotretinoin (acne medication) may cause dry eyes and a sudden decrease in night vision . Advise patients to be careful when driving at night . Oral contraceptives may be used to treat acne and can cause migraine headaches with visual auras . Rarely, oral contraceptives can cause raised intracranial pressure with headache and transient visual loss . Side effects include sensitivity to light, changes in color vision, blurred vision and problems with night vision . This is usually associated with the use of steroid eye drops, but can also occur with oral steroids . Patients taking oral steroids should have an IOP check with their optometrist . Patients taking steroid eye drops should always be under the review of an ophthalmologist . Crystals can be deposited within the retina and cornea, which may cause blurred vision . Topiramate (anticonvulsant, antimigraine treatment) may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil . Toxicity from smoking . Smoking increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the rate of its progression, which can cause serious and permanent retinal damage . ","Ensure that all your diabetic patients are enrolled for regular retinal screening examinations - these can save their sight. Hypertensive patients do not require eye screening, but if they develop a vein occlusion as a complication of hypertension, urgent referral is indicated. If patients present with an eye problem that has no apparent cause, it is worth reviewing the patient's systemic medications, as a number of systemic agents may have ocular side effects."
9781912776139,ch5,"Blood tests . Apart from CK, these tests will be normal or negative in ALS . Moderate rises in CK (up to 500 U/L) are common in ALS due to denervation, but CK levels are also frequently normal . NCS may be normal in ALS, whereas EMG is not (except in the distinct, pure UMN disorder, primary lateral sclerosis) . However, any abnormal EMG findings are not specific for ALS . ALS is a pure motor syndrome . Nerve conduction studies are performed in at least two limbs, including the weakest . The nerves typically tested are the median, ulnar, peroneal, tibial and sural nerves, but more uncommonly tested nerves may also be studied if clinically indicated . In ALS, these tests are primarily performed to exclude demyelination and to confirm normal sensory function . As such, they may be normal . In ALS, there should be no evidence of primary demyelination . Sensory nerve conduction studies should be normal . As such, minor abnormalities of sensory NCS do not exclude the diagnosis of ALS . The core aims of EMG in ALS are to . confirm LMN pathology where clinical signs are equivocal . The abnormalities seen on EMG are not specific for ALS; any cause of denervation will result in the same findings . Conversely, as EMG is operator dependent, if the clinical history and examination indicate ALS, then a lack of typical EMG changes should not delay the formal diagnosis . Abnormal spontaneous activity . Normal resting muscle shows no spontaneous activity, so spontaneous activity indicates muscle membrane instability, including inflammation of the muscle (myositis) and denervation . Abnormalities on voluntary activation . The presence of chronic denervation and reinnervation is determined with the individual gently activating the muscle being tested . Although this is not commonly performed in the diagnosis of ALS, it is important to recognize that increased jitter is not pathognomonic of neuromuscular transmission disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, but can also be seen in ALS . In healthy individuals, increasing the force of muscle contraction is achieved by activating, or recruiting, more motor units . These include motor unit number estimation and motor unit number index . Conventional MRI is typically normal in ALS . Significant relative frontal or temporal lobe atrophy may provide additional support for the diagnosis of ALS (Figure 5.4) . It is not uncommon for individuals who are subsequently diagnosed with ALS to have undergone surgery for degenerative spinal disease that is later determined to have been irrelevant to their presentation . Individuals with nerve compression typically have radicular pain and sensory symptoms . Genotyping is becoming a more frequent issue in ALS case stratification . The C9orf72 HRE is the most frequently identified cause of ALS in the Western hemisphere . A consistent definition of familial ALS, as for many conditions, is challenging . Muscle biopsy . Muscle biopsy should not be routinely performed for suspected ALS . If a muscle biopsy is performed in ALS, the histopathological findings will be non-specific and consistent with chronic denervation and reinnervation . All cases require a consistent history and examination to support the diagnosis of ALS and appropriate investigations to exclude alternative diagnoses . With this addition, an individual originally diagnosed as having 'possible' ALS, who would have been excluded from most clinical trials, could be reclassified as having laboratory-supported clinically probable ALS, often becoming eligible for trial inclusion as a result . The reclassification was made if the individual had EMG evidence of active denervation with compensatory chronic reinnervation in a body segment that did not have LMN signs on clinical examination . Hence, the separate category of laboratory-supported clinically probable ALS was removed, and individuals were categorized as definite, probable or possible according to the presence of LMN pathology, determined by either clinical examination or EMG . Use of diagnostic criteria . The different categories do not reflect a clinical spectrum of disease progression . Individuals do not follow a clinical course that evolves from possible to definite and they may die from the disease having never progressed from the category of 'possible ALS' . The concept of possible, probable and definite ALS is therefore not helpful in explaining the diagnosis to individuals and does not predict their disease trajectory . These terms should therefore be avoided when counseling symptomatic individuals . ","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis. No investigations are mandatory or independently diagnostic. Investigations are usually performed to exclude plausible alternative diagnoses and, in the case of electromyography (EMG), to improve diagnostic certainty in body regions without clinical signs. Most symptomatic individuals will have blood tests, brain and spinal MRI and neurophysiological testing during their diagnostic work up but there is risk of incidental findings that can lead to diagnostic delay. Evidence of active denervation and chronic reinnervation in multiple myotomes on EMG is supportive, but not specific, for ALS. EMG can detect subclinical lower motor neuron disease and expedite diagnosis. The El Escorial diagnostic criteria and subsequent modifications are intended for research purposes and do not predict the clinical course of the disease. The terms possible, probable and definite ALS should be avoided when counseling individuals."
9781908541963,chapter6,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a group of disorders of diverse etiology (Table 6.1) and presents as a spectrum of disease ranging from apparently innocuous deposition of fat in the liver to cirrhosis with liver failure . Once thought to be uncommon and benign, NAFLD is now recognized as one of the most common forms of serious liver disease in Western populations . Simple steatosis is the most predictable form of fatty liver disease, occurring in many patients with diabetes and/or obesity . The liver cells swell and are surrounded by inflammatory cells . These later two stages are unpredictable and develop from simple steatosis in a minority of patients . The pathogenesis of NAFLD is incompletely understood . Clinical presentation and diagnosis . Most patients with the early stages of NAFLD have few symptoms and are typically first identified by abnormal liver tests on routine screening . As there is no specific laboratory test for NAFLD, most practitioners make a tentative diagnosis by excluding other causes of liver disease . There is currently no consensus on which patients require a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of NAFLD . Many patients have an uneventful course; however, some will advance to end-stage liver disease and are vulnerable to all the complications of cirrhosis . Weight reduction is the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD . Unfortunately, weight loss is extraordinarily difficult for most patients and success is often not achieved . Hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron overload . The proximal intestine regulates iron balance . There is no normal process for eliminating excessive body iron . Genetic mutations associated with hemochromatosis result in altered regulation of iron absorption . In hemochromatosis, unregulated iron absorption continues uninterrupted from birth . Clinical presentation . Most patients with hemochromatosis complain of fatigue and some will report arthralgia and loss of libido . Often, abnormal iron levels are the only indication of the disease . Mutations in this gene are associated with hemochromatosis, and blood tests for the gene are commercially available . The most common mutation is cysteine to tyrosine at residue 282 (C282Y mutation) and is seen in most patients with the disease . Patients who are heterozygous for the C282Y mutation typically do not develop pathological iron overload . It is important to recognize that not all patients with hemochromatosis have typical mutations . Similarly, not all patients with typical mutations will develop pathological iron overload - the penetration of the mutations is not yet fully understood . A hepatic iron index, calculated by dividing the hepatic iron concentration by the patient's age, is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of the disorder . In general, it is recommended that patients with abnormal liver blood tests or other signs of liver disease undergo liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the presence and severity of fibrosis . Patients with hemochromatosis, particularly men with fibrotic disease, are at significant risk for hepatocellular carcinoma . Screening for hemochromatosis . Early diagnosis allows for reduction of iron overload before injury occurs . Close relatives of patients identified with hemochromatosis should be screened by measuring transferrin saturation and genetic markers . Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper homeostasis . Excessive accumulation of copper in the liver, brain and other tissues leads to organ dysfunction (Table 6.5) . Clinical presentation . Symptoms and signs of Wilson's disease typically develop in older children and young adults, although in a few patients the disease is not discovered until the fifth or sixth decade . Younger patients usually present with hepatic dysfunction, whereas neuropsychiatric manifestations dominate the presentation of older patients . All young patients with abnormal liver tests, signs of liver disease or any unexplained neuropsychiatric disorder deserve investigation . Serum ceruloplasmin is low in 95% of patients with Wilson's disease . It is also associated with liver disease in children and adults . Although ATD is not rare (it affects approximately 1 in 1800 births), only a small percentage of patients with ATD will develop liver disease . There is no specific treatment for ATD liver disease . Transplant is an option for patients with advanced liver disease provided their lungs have not been too severely affected . ","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder, most often seen in obese or diabetic patients. NAFLD is a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to cirrhosis with liver failure. When associated with obesity, NAFLD is best treated with weight loss. Hemochromatosis is easily treatable but underdiagnosed. It is reasonable to screen patients at risk of hemochromatosis by measuring the transferrin saturation in early middle age."
9781908541666,ch_4,"Type 1 diabetes afflicts millions of people worldwide . Type 1a is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that cause immune destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans; in type 1b diabetes, such evidence is lacking . The hallmark of type 1 diabetes mellitus (also known, historically, as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) is insulin deficiency . Type 1 diabetes differs from type 2 in many ways; the key features of type 1 diabetes are illustrated in Table 3.2 . In clinical practice it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether an individual patient has type 1 or type 2 diabetes when classic features are not present . Testing for autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes and insulin secretory reserve helps to distinguish the two conditions . An increase in the incidence of cases of type 1 diabetes is being observed in many areas of the world . Children who develop type 1 diabetes are often heavier in early childhood and tend to be taller . Viral infection has long been considered the most likely environmental factor involved in type 1 diabetes . A significant association between enterovirus infection detected by molecular methods and autoimmune type 1 diabetes has been demonstrated . Coxsackie B viruses have been isolated from the pancreases of patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes . Viruses (such as Coxsackie) may directly attack the beta cell or may act by initiating autoimmune destruction of the beta cell . The only certain association is between rubella infection during pregnancy and increased risk of the neonate developing type 1 diabetes . Despite this and the longstanding suspicion of a relationship between type 1 diabetes and preceding viral infection, the precise role of viral infections in the etiology of type 1 diabetes is not yet clear . Similarly, reports that early ingestion of cereal or gluten may increase the risk of development of type 1 diabetes remain to be substantiated . Type 1 diabetes is a complex genetic trait . Familial clustering of type 1 diabetes is suggested by an average risk in siblings of 6%, compared with 0.4% in the general population . The concordance for type 1 diabetes is approximately 30-50% for monozygotic or identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) . Nevertheless, a family history of type 1 diabetes is more likely to be absent than present in index cases . Many studies have evaluated candidate genes for disease association, leading to the identification of two chromosomal regions with consistent and significant association with type 1 diabetes . These are the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and the insulin gene region . Indeed, approximately 30% of patients with type 1 diabetes are HLA-DQ2/DQ8 heterozygotes . The insulin gene is a very plausible candidate susceptibility locus, as insulin may act as an autoantigen in the immune-mediated process leading to type 1 diabetes . Other susceptibility loci have been identified in certain groups of people with type 1 diabetes . Mechanisms of autoimmune beta cell destruction . Insulitis is deemed to be the precursor of the process of progressive beta cell destruction . Islet cell antibodies (ICA) are present in the serum of approximately 75% of patients at the onset of type 1 diabetes (Figure 3.4) . The presence of IAA, GADA and IA-2 in addition to ICA greatly increases the risk of subsequent type 1 diabetes compared with the presence of ICA alone . Immune destruction of beta cells . Insulitis is associated with the presence of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and macrophages, suggesting that these cells play an important role in the destruction of beta cells . We know that the destructive process is very specific to beta cells, with alpha cells being left intact . Such cytokines have been shown to exert toxic effects on the beta cell and to inhibit insulin secretion . Experimental manipulation to prevent T cell responses in animal studies can also prevent the emergence of diabetes . Some individuals may develop the autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes but not go on to develop the disease; persistence of ICA, however, is associated with progressive beta cell destruction and the emergence of clinical type 1 diabetes . Loss of beta cell mass . The autoimmune process in type 1 diabetes is associated with a decline in beta cell mass . Hyperglycemia produces the classic symptoms with which people with type 1 diabetes present . Rarely, and sadly, cases still present in diabetic ketoacidosis because the diagnosis of acute-onset type 1 diabetes has not been considered . ","Type 1 diabetes results from an absolute deficiency of insulin. Osmotic symptoms at onset include thirst, polydipsia and polyuria. Environmental factors that cause the condition are unknown, but possibly include viral infection. Multiple inherited genetic factors influence both disease susceptibility and resistance. Autoimmune processes lead to beta cell destruction and a decline in beta cell mass."
9781910797426,ch04,"Around 10% of younger patients with stones in the gallbladder have CBD stones at the time of cholecystectomy, rising with age to around 20% . The exact prevalence and incidence of bile duct stones is not known . Patients with severe or suppurative cholangitis are severely ill, with septicemia, shock and mental confusion . Leukocytosis is seen in patients with cholangitis . Increased amylase or lipase are present in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis . Its sensitivity for detection of a dilated bile duct is up to 90%, and even higher in jaundiced patients . Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a minimally invasive endoscopic imaging modality for CBD stones with an accuracy of around 98% (Figure 4.2) . MRCP is a useful, non-invasive and reliable test for CBD stones . MRCP and EUS generally have comparable high accuracy; however, for small stones less than 6 mm in diameter, EUS may be more accurate . The accuracy for CBD stones is around 85%, less than for EUS and MRCP . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is accurate in more than 90% of patients but should be performed only with the intent for therapeutic intervention (Figure 4.4) . ERCP is more invasive than other imaging modalities, with risks that include acute pancreatitis (about 5%), bleeding and perforation . Intraductal ultrasound during ERCP has a similar accuracy and is marginally superior to ERCP alone . These diagnostic ERCP techniques are invasive and should generally not be used in preference to conventional EUS or MRCP . Intraoperative cholangiography is performed at the time of cholecystectomy to detect the presence of CBD stones . It is performed routinely at some institutions, whereas others perform it when there is suspicion of retained CBD stones . In an analysis of more than 4000 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 4% of patients were found to have stones in the CBD, but small stones do sometimes pass spontaneously from the CBD into the duodenum . Suspected choledocholithiasis after cholecystectomy . If there is high suspicion for CBD stones, one may proceed directly to ERCP, but again, in general, the diagnosis should first be confirmed by EUS or MRCP . Patients for whom the suspicion of CBD stones is low may be observed clinically for a while before initiating any investigation involving EUS or MRCP . Medical treatment . Endoscopic treatment . If ERCP clears all stones from the CBD, the patient can then undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Some patients may require more than one attempt by ERCP to clear all stones from the CBD . A plastic stent is sometimes placed in the bile duct during ERCP to achieve biliary drainage if it is not possible to remove all the stones and further attempts should be planned . Large stones may require endoscopic lithotripsy during ERCP with or without cholangioscopy or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in combination with ERCP . Clearance of all stones from the CBD through ERCP is possible in more than 95% of patients . ERCP with sphincterotomy is also useful for patients who have recently undergone a cholecystectomy and present with retained CBD stones . Complications of ERCP include pancreatitis, perforation, bleeding and cholangitis in about 5% of patients . The risk of cholangitis after ERCP is increased if ERCP is attempted but biliary drainage is not achieved . Alternative radiological and surgical methods for biliary decompression in acutely ill patients with biliary obstruction should be readily available . Surgical treatment . Surgical exploration of the CBD may be needed for patients with stones that could not be cleared by ERCP . This is, however, a rare event in high volume ERCP centers . Another indication for surgical CBD exploration includes stones discovered during intraoperative cholangiography . This approach is successful in clearing CBD stones in more then 90% of cases . Future developments are likely to include . more clear-cut guidelines on use of various imaging modalities for detection of bile duct stones . ","Around 10-20% of patients with stones in the gallbladder have common bile duct (CBD) stones at the time of cholecystectomy (the prevalence rises with age). Transabdominal ultrasound is 25-80% accurate for detection of CBD stones, depending on the experience of the examiner. Endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are accurate tests for detection of CBD stones and should generally precede endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), unless the clinical signs and symptoms and transabdominal ultrasound findings make therapeutic ERCP inevitable. Clearance of all stones from the CBD via ERCP is possible in more than 95% of patients. Biliary decompression, preferably by endoscopic or radiologic means, is critical in severe suppurative cholangitis with choledocholithiasis."
9781912776153,chp2,"Patients may have no cardiac symptoms at all (exempli gratia with atrial fibrillation [AF] after a stroke, or as a finding at screening) . Alternatively, patients may present with sudden cardiac death as their first symptom, usually as a result of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, and they may be resuscitated from a cardiac arrest, often out of hospital . There are often few or no physical signs, and although cardiovascular examination may be normal, this does not rule out a cardiac cause . Patients with chest pain, rhythm disturbance or murmurs need further investigation . Palpitations are common in patients with any cardiac arrhythmia . When interviewing a patient with palpitations, it is important to determine whether the palpitations represent abnormal awareness of a normal heart beat or an actual cardiac rhythm disturbance (id est normal awareness of an abnormal beat) . Try to get patients to be as clear as possible in their description, and ask them to tap out what they feel their heart is actually doing . Table 2.1 highlights some of the key questions to ask patients to help with the diagnosis . Palpitation is the baseline symptom for all arrhythmias, but there are few specific symptoms that differentiate one rhythm from another . The occurrence of other symptoms depends on factors such as the patient's premorbid fitness level and the presence or absence of underlying cardiac disease . Sometimes patients will notice that their palpitations feel irregular, suggesting AF, but this is not a consistent or reliable observation and it can be difficult to determine whether or not the heart is regular at fast rates . Cardiac rhythm disturbance . Ectopics arise through firing of ventricular or atrial foci and the symptoms often have three components . 'the early beat' - the ectopic itself . Although the sensation is abnormal, some patients do not notice the ectopic itself because of the reduced filling time and reduced stroke volume . Usually, the more frequent the ectopics, the more likely the patient is to notice . Symptoms are more common with ventricular ectopics, which are associated with a greater disturbance to hemodynamic function . Symptoms are related to uncoordinated ventricular contraction, causing abnormal movement of the heart within the chest, or due to retrograde atrial activation and contraction of the atria against closed atrioventricular valves . Although the majority of symptomatic patients experience (normal) occasional ectopics that are generally benign, ectopics may also be associated with an adverse prognosis . Knowledge of whether the patient has structural heart disease is crucial in risk stratification . If the patient has structural heart disease, the presence of ventricular ectopics may require further cardiological investigation . Slow heart rate . Although many patients seem to notice every abnormal heart beat, other patients never notice any change in their heart rhythm . Persistent tachycardias may also produce symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue because of hemodynamic compromise . Falls and syncope . Cardiac syncope is usually characterized by sudden and complete loss of consciousness for less than 1-2 minutes . Syncope and blackouts are discussed in Chapter 3 . This is a subjective symptom . It is not often reliably associated with cardiac pathology . However, pain is not usually an accepted feature of an arrhythmia . If the patient complains of pain, then other conditions should be considered, such as associated angina . It is common for anxious patients to complain of a sharp, left inframammary stabbing pain, but this is often innocuous . Arrhythmias can be fatal at initial presentation or after persistent episodes . Symptomatic patients are evaluated to determine any concerns regarding possible cardiac arrhythmias . When symptoms are prominent, or if patients have an abnormal electrocardiogram, such as showing pre-excitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), or if patients have underlying heart disease, an evaluation in the arrhythmia clinic should be obtained . Asymptomatic patients . Arrhythmias are usually treated because symptoms interfere with a patient's quality of life . In certain situations it is crucial to know if treatment is warranted because of an adverse prognosis even if the patient is asymptomatic (Table 2.2) . ","Patients with arrhythmias can present in a variety of ways. Occasionally, it may be important for the patient to distinguish increased awareness of heart beat from true cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with palpitations and known structural cardiac disease should be evaluated without delay."
9781908541994,ch07,"Treatment of comedones and macrocomedones . Acne surgery involves expressing the contents of closed comedones in an effort to speed the resolution of acne . There is a risk of increasing the inflammation associated with acne if the contents of the comedone are extruded into the dermis, rather than onto the surface of the skin . With the advent of effective topical retinoids, this procedure is used much less often . Light electrocautery . Macrocomedones are large comedones that are often resistant to treatment with topical retinoids and oral isotretinoin . Sun exposure is reported to have a beneficial effect in up to 70% of patients with acne . However, the effects are short-lived, and clearly the potential risk of skin malignancies negates the possible short-term improvement that ultraviolet (UV) light might induce in acne . Visible light treatment has the advantage of avoiding the potential risks of UV radiation . acnes) is known to produce endogenous porphyrins, which absorb visible light at 415 nm and could therefore produce a photodynamic reaction following irradiation with blue light . Red light is able to penetrate the tissue more deeply than blue light and has anti-inflammatory activity . A recent review has assessed the effects and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of acne: 492 patients from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated . Light sources included red light, intense pulsed light (IPL), pulsed dye laser (PDL), long-pulsed dye laser (LPDL) and green light . Many combinations of light sources and photosensitizers have produced positive results in patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions; in some cases, these treatments have also reduced sebum production . However, the evidence for PDT as a good treatment option for acne, producing positive results with acceptable side effects, is limited . ALA plus red light seems to be the optimal choice . More RCTs are needed to determine the best types and concentrations of photosensitizers and light sources, and the duration of light activation and incubation in order to obtain the best results . Treatment of inflammatory nodules/cysts . Triamcinolone can be used in concentrations of 2.5-10 mg/mL . Often a volume of 0.05-0.25 mL per lesion is used . This mode of therapy is a useful adjuvant to treatment with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin . It is particularly helpful in patients who develop these lesions only rarely and who are not candidates for treatment with isotretinoin . Management of scars . Patients with a family history of scarring acne may be at increased risk of developing acne scars . Hypertrophic and keloidal scars occur most often on the chest and back of young patients with severe cystic acne . The best solution to the problem of acne scarring is to institute appropriate therapy early in the course of acne to avoid this complication . Referral to a dermatologist should be considered for a consultation regarding the possible use of intralesional injection with triamcinolone, treatment with silicone gel sheeting or laser therapy . Acne scars that are erythematous may respond to treatment with a pulsed-dye laser, which reduces the erythema of the scar . The treatment of atrophic acne scars is based on type, distribution and depth . Deep scars should be treated singularly in order to make them superficial . Appropriate techniques include fillers, subcision, punch elevation, punch grafting, surgery and chemical reconstruction of skin scars (CROSS), a method that uses a high concentration of trichloroacetic acid localized on the depth of a single scar . The first dermal filler for acne scars has now been approved by the FDA . It has been shown to add volume to the skin and lift and smooth pitted acne scars to the level of the surrounding areas . Superficial and widely distributed scars may benefit from laser therapy, peelings, dermarolling and dermabrasion . Punch grafting is a useful technique wherein the scar is removed with a punch excision . CO laser abrasion and peelings should be used only after the patient's acne is no longer active . At present, a waiting period of 6 months following treatment with isotretinoin is recommended before proceeding; otherwise, patients can develop significant postinflammatory pigmentation . ","Macrocomedones frequently require surgical treatment with cautery, as pharmacological therapeutic options are unhelpful. Acne nodules/cysts respond well to intralesional triamcinolone injection or cryotherapy. Acne scarring is common, and the best approach is prevention by early effective therapy. Laser therapy may be helpful for acne scarring."
9781910797297,chp4,"The immunophenotype for LyP is generally CD3+, CD4+, CD8-/+, CD30+ . Histopathology shows a wedge-shaped infiltrate of large, atypical, anaplastic CD4+, CD30+ T cells, sometimes with morphological similarities to Reed-Sternberg cells . Epidermotropism may or may not be present . Epidermotropism is also usually present . Clinical correlation is necessary for a definitive diagnosis (Figure 4.3) . However, CD30+ is generally not seen in either of these differential diagnoses, so demonstration of CD30+ T cells with clinical correlation is crucial for diagnosis of this histological mimic . The histopathology shows small, cerebriform T cells in the epidermis with larger, atypical, anaplastic CD30+/- T cells in the dermis . Although the histological pattern overlaps with transformed MF, all lesions regress spontaneously . Like LyP, the immunophenotype of PC-ALCL is generally CD3+/-, CD4+, CD8-, CD30+, with loss of CD5 and CD7 . MF with CD30+ large cell transformation is also composed of CD30+ T cells (see Table 4.2) . Histologically, PC-ALCL is generally EMA and ALK-1 negative compared with systemic disease . Primary cutaneous small/medium CD4+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder . Systemic work-up is not needed in patients with localized lesions . Pathology illustrates a dense, diffuse dermal infiltrate of small- to medium-sized pleomorphic CD4+ T cells (Figures 4.8 and 4.9) . An admixture of reactive B cells is common . Clinically, SPTCL and lupus panniculitis have significant overlap as well . Primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma . As discussed above, there is histological overlap between SPTCL and primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma (see Table 4.3) . However, the clinical course of primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma is much worse . The infiltrates are characterized by a dense, nodular to diffuse pattern of medium- to large-sized pleomorphic cells (Figure 4.13) . Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma (Berti's lymphoma) . This cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma is characterized by marked epidermotropism of atypical CD8+ T cells (Figure 4.15) . The immunophenotype is CD3+, CD4-, CD7+, CD8+, TIA-1+, CD45RA+, CD45RO-, CD56-, EBER-, betaF1+ (Figure 4.17) . There can be a striking overlap with the features of primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma . This malignancy is a cytotoxic systemic lymphoma with common cutaneous involvement . EBER1+, but CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD57, betaF1 and TCR-gamma are routinely negative . As this is a cytotoxic lymphoma, complete systemic work-up is necessary . Cutaneous adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . Cutaneous adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) also has a known viral etiology - HTLV-1 . Cutaneous findings are generally associated with indolent forms of the disease . CD25 is also characteristically expressed in ATLL, but is not diagnostic . Complete systemic work-up is needed as there is often leukemic and/or nodal involvement in these patients . Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma . Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a systemic T-cell lymphoma with common skin involvement . The histopathology varies with the clinical presentation . Superficial, perivascular infiltration is present in macular/papular disease (Figure 4.18), while diffuse nodular histology is associated with the clinical presentation of plaques and tumors . As this is truly a systemic lymphoma, complete work-up is necessary, including lymph node biopsy . Characteristically, the neoplastic cells are CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD56+, CD123+, TCL1+ . ","Multiple histological variants of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) exist, although there is no prognostic significance between the subtypes. However, some of the subtypes histologically overlap with other forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and clinical correlation is needed to distinguish these. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) is composed of sheets of CD30+ activated T cells that comprise more than 75% of the neoplastic cells. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1, epithelial membrane antigen and full staging work-up are used to distinguish between a primary cutaneous tumor and cutaneous involvement from nodal ALCL. Primary cutaneous small/medium CD4+ T cell lymphoproliferative disorder is an indolent process comprised of diffuse to nodular collections of CD4+ cells that generally present as single papules on the head and neck. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a subcutaneous indolent disorder composed of CD3+, CD8+, betaF-1+ T cells with notable rimming of adipocytes, in contrast to gamma/δ lymphoma which is clinically aggressive and comprised of dermal and subcutaneous CD4-/CD8- or rarely CD4+, CD8+ T cells with a gamma/δ (TCR-gamma+) phenotype. The clinically aggressive cytotoxic CTCLs are: primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma, primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma (Berti's lymphoma) and extranodal NK-T cell lymphoma, nasal type. These diseases have a CD8+ or CD56+ immunophenotype and display T-cell intracellular antigen-1+, granzyme-B+ and perforin+ cytotoxic markers. Full systemic work-up is necessary. Other rare secondary cutaneous T-cell processes occur from systemic T-cell lymphomas, and correlation with nodal histopathology is helpful in diagnosis."
9781910797082,ch06,"UVB radiation is absorbed mainly by the epidermis and is an effective treatment for psoriasis . A meticulous record of the total cumulative UV dose for each patient is kept to avoid excessive exposure . To achieve clearance, patients receive treatment two or three times a week for 3-10 weeks, depending on disease response . In general, phototherapy is very well tolerated and is viewed by patients as an escape from the problems of topical agents . Elderly patients may not tolerate standing in the warm enclosed environment of the phototherapy cabinet for prolonged exposure times . Short-term risks . Narrow-band UVB may be less likely to produce burning than broad-band UVB, though both are probably associated with a long-term risk of skin cancer . Long-term risks . Broad-band UVB is probably associated with a small increase in the risk of squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in patients receiving high-level exposure (more than 300 treatments) . Home phototherapy . Although phototherapy is a popular and effective treatment for psoriasis, a significant number of patients find the repeated journeys to the hospital and/or clinic for multiple treatment sessions inconvenient and also expensive . Short-term risks . Nausea and vomiting secondary to the ingestion of the sensitizing drug occurs in 10-20% of patients . Pruritus is often seen after the first two or three treatments, and may be reduced by adjusting the dose of both the drug and UVA . Adequate use of emollients after and between phototherapy treatments will also help to reduce the inevitable drying effect . Phototoxic reactions can be avoided by careful dosing, but are not uncommon even in patients treated by experienced personnel . Eye protection . Current recommendations for all patients receiving oral PUVA therapy include wearing photoprotective UVA-screening glasses for 24 hours following treatment . Fortunately, retrospective surveys have not shown an increased risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts in patients receiving extensive PUVA, provided such safety precautions have been taken . Long-term risks of PUVA are significant . The amount of freckling usually correlates with the number of treatments . Skin cancer . Increased numbers of premalignant lesions (actinic keratoses) have been noted in patients with skin types I and II . Patients who have received large cumulative doses of PUVA (in excess of 2000 J/cm or more than 260 treatments) are at greater risk of squamous cell carcinoma, particularly if they are fair-skinned . To reduce the overall risk of skin cancer, PUVA is often combined with systemic retinoids or topical therapy, such as vitamin D and vitamin A derivatives, so that fewer treatments are needed and the cumulative UVA dose is reduced . As with phototherapy, PUVA is relatively contraindicated in patients who already have risk factors for skin cancer . It should therefore be prescribed for these patients only with extreme caution . Monitoring the UVA cabinet . Patient safety . During UVA exposure, the patient should wear underwear to protect the genitals . All patients should receive regular twice-yearly total-body skin examinations to check for occult malignancies . Staff protection . The dose of methoxsalen is based on the patient's weight; the most effective dose is 0.3-0.4 mg/kg . It is essential that the dosage of UVA and, if necessary, oral methoxsalen, is adjusted depending on the individual patient's sensitivity and skin type . Patients with skin type I (always burns, never tans) require lower doses than patients with types V or VI (moderately or heavily pigmented skin) . Patients are usually treated twice a week . The patient soaks in water containing measured amounts of the sensitizing drug before UVA exposure . PUVA is indicated for patients with psoriasis resistant to topical therapies or with moderate-to-severe psoriasis affecting more than 10% of the body surface area . Caution must be exercised in patients with inflammatory psoriasis . PUVA is contraindicated for patients who . have a history of skin cancer, particularly malignant melanoma . PUVA is extremely effective in most cases, and especially in patients with chronic stable plaque forms of psoriasis involving the trunk and limbs . Remission rates with PUVA are superior to almost all other forms of therapy, including systemic treatments . ","Phototherapy (broad-band UVB and narrow-band UVB) is widely used for extensive chronic plaque psoriasis and sebo-psoriasis, and persistent guttate psoriasis. Burning and, rarely, photosensitive rashes complicate phototherapy in the short term. There is a small increase in the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer with long-term phototherapy. Photochemotherapy (PUVA) is indicated for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis involving more than 10% of the body surface area, and those whose psoriasis does not respond to topical therapy. Short-term risks of PUVA include nausea (following oral ingestion of methoxsalen), itching and phototoxic reactions. Long-term risks of PUVA include premature skin aging and skin cancer (non-melanoma and melanoma). In patients who already have risk factors for skin cancer, phototherapy and PUVA should be prescribed only with extreme caution."

It also ensures that a patient with multiple risk factors, even those considered borderline, is managed as a high-risk individual . The aim of management is to tackle the syndrome as a whole, and obesity in particular . Effects of insulin resistance on other organs . Typically, 10% weight loss will result in . 50% reduction in fasting glucose . 8% increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) . 30% reduction in triglycerides . Is weight loss always beneficial? Obesity, particularly when severe, is associated with an increase in mortality . For people who are overweight, gaining more weight increases mortality . The link between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is firmly established (Table 3.2; Figure 3.2) . The risk of diabetes is magnified in individuals with . abdominal rather than peripheral obesity (see Figure 3.1) . a family history of diabetes . In some aboriginal communities the rate of diabetes is as high as 33% . Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease . Management of obese patients at risk of or with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Weight loss . Weight loss of 0.5-9.0 kg is associated with a 30-40% reduction in diabetes-related mortality . Dietary management . Dietary management of obesity is described in Chapter 5 . A reduction in sedentary activity is also important . Weight-loss drugs . Orlistat reduces fat mass and has effects on glucose regulation that are beneficial in the management of diabetes in obese patients . The pharmacotherapy of obesity is discussed in Chapter 8 . First-line pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with obesity is with metformin (unless contraindicated) . Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycemia . They may also increase the secretion of endogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) . Gastrointestinal side effects, in particular an increase in malodorous flatus, limit their use . They increase insulin and inhibit glucagon secretion while also slowing gastric emptying, increasing satiety and promoting nutrient utilization . They are not associated with hypoglycemia and have a neutral effect on weight . The expression of the glucose transporter SGLT2 increases in type 2 diabetes mellitus leading to increased glucose reabsorption . They have a neutral effect on weight . Bariatric surgery (see Chapter 8) has a high success rate in patients with diabetes . increased preponderance of small dense LDL particles . Dyslipidemia develops progressively as BMI increases from 21 kg/m, increasing the risk of CHD by a factor of 3.6 . Weight loss significantly improves the lipid profile . During weight loss, HDL levels decrease initially but then increase once weight loss has stabilized . Dietary management . Anti-obesity drug therapy in conjunction with lifestyle changes has been shown to improve lipid profiles in obese patients . Obesity, particularly severe obesity, or the presence of obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and activation of the acute phase response, as reflected by levels of C-reactive protein . Obesity is a risk factor for the development of hypertension . More than 85% of patients with hypertension have a BMI of 25 kg/m or more . The risk of hypertension is increased fivefold among obese people compared with their lean counterparts, and in up to two-thirds blood pressure is raised as a direct consequence of excess weight . Higher baseline BMI, even within the 'normal' range, was consistently associated with increased risk of hypertension . Increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with high resting heart rate, and this observed clustering increased with the degree of obesity, probably explained by impaired autonomic nerve function . Mechanism of obesity-related hypertension . Increased renal sodium reabsorption and blood volume expansion are central features in the development of obesity-related hypertension . Salt intake is more likely to be associated with hypertension in obesity . Weight loss through dietary modification and increased physical activity is the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of both obesity and hypertension, whether they occur alone or together . ","Obesity significantly affects cardiometabolic status and risk. The metabolic syndrome defines the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors under the umbrella of obesity. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the comorbidity most closely linked with obesity. Weight loss prevents the disease in those at risk and improves glycemic control when it is present. Lipid disorders and hypertension are exacerbated by obesity and add to cardiovascular risk. Weight loss rapidly and effectively reduces cardiovascular risk and the burden of atrial fibrillation, and improves cardiac function."
9781910797495,chp7,"Central pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as 'pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion (or dysfunction) of the central nervous system (CNS)' . It has now been recognized that epilepsy can be painful as can Parkinson's disease . Multiple sclerosis causes central pain in about 60% of patients . Post-stroke pain . reported that lesions limited to the ventral caudal thalamic nucleus may produce a similar presentation of central post-stroke pain . Thus, there are several sites of lesion associated with post-stroke pain; unfortunately, this does not yet provide insight into the precise mechanisms of such pain . Pain following spinal cord injury . The study of central pain arising from SCI has been more productive than that of post-stroke pain . which reported that at-level SCI pain often progressed to below-level pain - suggesting spinal and supraspinal mechanisms triggered by at-level SCI pain predispose to below-level 'central' pain . Brain-imaging studies have reported neuroplastic changes in the brain that correlate with the severity of post-SCI pain (see Figure 1.10) . The relative roles of each level in at-level and below-level SCI pain remain to be clarified . Lesions in the brain . Stroke is the most common cause of neuropathic pain related to brain lesions . More than 8% of all patients who have had a stroke suffer with central pain . In view of the high incidence of stroke, about 90% of all central pain is associated with stroke . Because stroke is associated with communication difficulties, the high prevalence of central pain was not recognized until quite recently . Previously, it was erroneously believed that only thalamic lesions resulted in central pain . Spinal cord injury . reported that 34% had below-level neuropathic pain (see pain taxonomy, Table 7.2), which was deemed to be central pain . A further 41% had at-level neuropathic pain that probably started at the peripheral level, but usually became 'centralized' . Musculoskeletal and visceral pain contributed to an overall prevalence of 81% of participants reporting pain . Onset of central pain . Time of pain onset after the initial lesion is extremely variable . With stroke, 63% reported onset of central pain within 1 month, 19% between 1 and 6 months and another 19% between 6 and 12 months . Sometimes onset of central pain occurs several years after injury . Pain sites . Central pain is usually localized in an area of complete or partial loss of sensation, or in an area of abnormal sensation . Spontaneous or evoked episodes of shooting or stabbing pain also often occur . Patients report that pain can be triggered by emotional situations and may be decreased by intense concentration on work or other mental activities . Central pain is one of the most challenging of all chronic pain conditions . However, differential diagnosis of the type of pain is crucial to distinguish nociceptive pain and peripheral neuropathic pain from central pain (see Table 7.2) . The impact of central pain on the individual is usually severe, so a multidisciplinary assessment in a biopsychosocial framework is essential . At 12-month follow-up, patients receiving CBT had decreased levels of depression and anxiety but no change in pain . Control patients showed no changes . In 2008, Finnerup evaluated published randomized controlled trials in central pain with at least 10 participants . In contrast, there is no evidence for the efficacy of amitriptyline at doses of 50-125 mg in post-SCI central pain . Some studies of intravenous lidocaine infusion report short-term efficacy for SCI pain or post-stroke pain . One study supports its use for SCI pain . Intravenous ketamine has been reported to reduce continuous or evoked pain in small studies . However, Hocking and Cousins reported no evidence of long-term efficacy in any chronic pain condition when given by the oral route . A second study reported an oromucosal spray based on whole-plant cannabis to be effective in relieving central pain . Spinal cord stimulation has proven to be unsuccessful in the large majority of individuals with central pain . Strictly speaking this is a 'peripheral lesion'; however, often there is extensive damage to the spinal cord and the pain is similar to central pain . ","Central pain results from lesions in the brain and brainstem or spinal cord. The most common causes are stroke and traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), though there are many other causes. More than 8% of patients who have had a stroke develop central pain. This is probably an underestimate because communication problems may impede diagnosis of pain. Onset of post-stroke pain may occur up to several years after the injury. Within 2 weeks of SCI, 12% of patients have below-level neuropathic pain which is 'central'; by 6 months, 20% have central pain. Mean onset time is 1.8 +- 1.7 years (wide variation). The pathophysiology of central post-stroke pain (CPSP) involves a key role for lesions in diverse areas of the brain, including several different thalamic nuclei. One such lesion results in disinhibition of a nociceptive pathway that projects to the anterior cingulate cortex (limbic system) - this pathophysiology is associated with the burning quality of CPSP. The pathophysiology of SCI pain involves a 'spinal generator' and a 'supraspinal generator/amplifier'. Treatment of central pain is extremely challenging and requires a multimodal approach based on a biopsychosocial model. Differential diagnosis of pain type is crucial. New innovative physical/psychological treatments show promise of addressing maladaptive brain neuroplasticity changes. Pharmacotherapy, based on only a small number of controlled studies, have demonstrated efficacy of amitriptyline for CPSP (although not yet studied, a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs] may be preferable because of their lower toxicity) and pregabalin in both SCI and CPSP. Short-term efficacy has been reported for systemic (intravenous infusion) lidocaine (lignocaine), propofol and ketamine, but there is no evidence of long-term efficacy. Dorsal root entry zone lesioning can provide long-term relief of central pain after brachial plexus avulsion."
9781905832729,ch_5,"It also gives a good indication of fluid intake . The diary for a patient with OAB will show frequent, irregular, small-volume voids . Urodynamic studies are rarely indicated initially in patients who have symptoms suggestive of OAB, and most patients receive empirical treatment (drugs and or behavioral) whether or not urodynamic studies show detrusor overactivity . The only real role for these tests in patients with OAB symptoms is if conservative therapy fails and more invasive treatment is contemplated . Urodynamic investigation is necessary for the diagnosis of detrusor overactivity . It is important to note, however, that only approximately 50% of patients with symptoms of detrusor overactivity will have an abnormality on supine slow-filling cystometry . A typical cystometry trace from a patient with detrusor overactivity is shown in Figure 2.5 . Behavioral therapy (sometimes referred to as 'conservative treatment') helps an individual change habits to modify bladder symptoms and learn training techniques to control symptoms of bladder dysfunction . Alteration in fluid intake . Reduction in fluid intake can bring about a dramatic improvement in patients with OAB . However, many patients with OAB will report too severe a restriction of daily fluid intake which is also not a good practice . A trial of caffeine-intake reduction is indicated in all patients presenting with OAB symptoms . See Table 4.1 for specific foods and beverages that patients should consider reducing to determine the effect on OAB symptoms . There is evidence to suggest that weight loss, even a moderate amount of 5 to 10%, can help with the symptoms of OAB in overweight patients . It is therefore worth advising weight loss to any patient who has a body mass index above 30 kg/m . Individuals should avoid constipation through increased fiber, exercise and fluid . Table 4.2 provides a high fiber mixture that can be recommended for patients with constipation . Bladder training with urgency suppression . Individuals with OAB symptoms usually void more frequently than normal (called 'defensive voiding') because of urgency, or to avoid situations where urgency is likely to cause a problem . In bladder training, the individual actively attempts to increase the interval between the first desire to void and the actual void . Patients are instructed to use techniques that control or suppress urgency . Slow, deep breathing exercises relax the bladder, decrease the intensity of the urgency and delay voiding, while distraction methods involve patients in tasks that require mental concentration . Patients are taught to resist rushing to the bathroom when experiencing the need to void as this increases pressure in the abdomen and may actually cause a detrusor contraction . Complementary therapies are treatments that are not part of the traditional OAB treatments and include acupuncture, relaxation, meditation and herbal remedies . Antimuscarinic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for symptoms of OAB and detrusor overactivity (Table 4.3) . The effects of antimuscarinic drugs in patients with OAB symptoms are shown in Table 4.4 . Research has shown that combining drug therapy with behavioral treatment will produce the best outcome in terms of reduction in OAB symptoms . Many recommend discontinuing the drug after some months to determine whether bladder training has occurred and symptoms are improved . Caution is advised in patients with significant bladder outlet obstruction and pre-existing constipation . Patients should be counseled on how to deal with side effects and given written information about the drug and simple management strategies . Topical gel is used daily . These drugs are taken once daily, which helps with compliance . BTX has been shown to be effective in the treatment of detrusor overactivity within 1-2 weeks of administration . It is being used increasingly in the treatment of refractory detrusor overactivity . Sacral nerve stimulation has been shown to be safe, effective and durable . This treatment is approved for use in both Europe and the USA . Urgency incontinence is also reduced . This allows bladder capacity to increase and lowers the intravesical pressure . The overactive bladder and urgency incontinence . A greater proportion of women with OAB have urgency incontinence (OAB-wet) than do men, who predominantly have OAB without incontinence (OAB-dry) . Not all patients with symptoms of OAB will be found to have detrusor overactivity, and not all patients with detrusor overactivity will have symptoms of bladder overactivity . ","Overactive bladder (OAB) describes a condition in which the patient experiences urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Detrusor overactivity refers to involuntary detrusor contractions during filling; diagnosis is by urodynamic investigation. Bladder overactivity can be neurogenic or idiopathic. Idiopathic OAB can be associated with bladder outlet obstruction. A frequency/volume bladder record is useful in diagnosis. Initial management includes behavioral modification. Antimuscarinic drugs are a mainstay of conservative treatment. Other options for refractory OAB are neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Intradetrusor botulinum toxin injection is under investigation and seems promising for refractory cases."
9781908541178,ch_8,"When/if the various non-surgical measures have proved ineffective, too slow in providing adequate relief or poorly tolerated, injection options can be considered . Epidural injections are mainly used to relieve refractory sciatic nerve root pain, dysesthesias and/or associated paresis . They can also provide periods of significant symptom relief when other treatments have failed, and for those patients who are high risk and therefore not candidates for surgery . Epidural injections are not without risk, however . Nerve root canal injections performed under fluoroscopic guidance carry similar risks to those associated with epidural injections . There is no guarantee that symptoms will be relieved by a nerve root canal injection, or that, even if properly performed, the intervention will relieve pain or restore useful function to weakened muscles . Facet (zygapophyseal) joint injection . Fluoroscopic guidance now allows precise needle placement into the facet joint for therapeutic injections . In an early study, injections of 3 mL of 5% hypertonic saline into facet joints provoked immediate local deep, dull pain in both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic controls . It was then relieved by an intra-articular injection of a local anesthetic . Subsequent studies, however, have not produced consistent results with regard to relief of symptoms, arthrographic findings or responses to intra-articular anesthetic injections . Facet joint denervation . Because of the overlapping enervation between facet joints, stimulating and/or relieving the pain in one joint is non-specific and cannot identify the source of the back pain . Facet joint corticosteroid injections share many of the above uncertainties because of the ambiguity of the symptoms and the poor correlation between symptoms and demonstrable facet joint pathology . Facet joint synovial cyst corticosteroid injection . Sacroiliac joint injection . Despite the ambiguities in the clinical assessment of sacroiliac dysfunctions, almost all patients with suspected non-inflammatory sacroiliac joint pain recover spontaneously or with non-surgical therapies . For those few who do not improve, sacroiliac corticosteroid joint injections can be performed under fluoroscopic guidance in a manner similar to that used for facet joint injection . Those patients who showed a positive response in terms of pain reduction on moving the sacroiliac joint area then received injections of betamethasone and lidocaine . Physical therapy was continued, and if improvement was not sustained, a second injection was given . Although far from conclusive, this suggests that sacroiliac joint pain may be responsive to intra-articular corticosteroid injections . Intrabursal injection . Good results from appropriate surgery by expert surgeons have been reported to give complete relief of leg pain in 73% of patients and complete relief of back pain in 63% . Most patients with symptoms of nerve root compression respond, but 7% may experience a recurrence . These procedures use surgical approaches to shrink the nucleus and relieve its painful pressures, in a similar way to percutaneous chymopapain nucleolysis, which used an enzymatic approach . The chymopapain procedure was associated with complications and was far from predictably more effective than non-surgical treatment, however, and it is now seldom used . Percutaneous laser discectomy uses laser energy to perform the discectomy . Percutaneous thermal intradiscal catheters have been tried in a small series of patients with low back pain who would otherwise have been treated with a lumbar fusion procedure . A measure of pain relief was obtained by about 75% of the 25 patients after 7 months . anterior interbody fusion . posterior fusion . intertransverse process fusion . Anterior discectomies with and without fusion have not proved as successful as laminotomy and disc fragment excision and are now seldom performed . With predominant slippage at L4-L5, failure to fuse the L5-S1 resulted in only a 55% success rate for the surgical fusion . Both procedures utilize a percutaneous needle to guide the injection of PMMA . They can be performed on an outpatient basis, and provide prompt and sustainable relief of the compression fracture pain . The long-term benefit of these procedures remains under investigation . In general, kyphoplasty has been associated with more favorable results than vertebroplasty . Injections and surgery . ",Epidural and/or nerve root canal injections are safer and more reliable if done with fluoroscopic monitoring. Intrabursal and trigger-point injections with low-dose steroids can often provide prompt pain reduction. Surgery is usually effective for refractory sciatica but is of equivocal benefit for low back pain. Approximately one-third of successful spine fusions provide pain relief for chronic low back pain.

FGAs are also indicated for the maintenance phase of treatment . Improving adherence . A major problem in the maintenance treatment of people with schizophrenia is lack of adherence to the recommended pharmacological treatment regimen (see page 84) . Adverse effects . FGAs have a broad range of adverse effects . EPS are a major cause of non-adherence to treatment . The other major adverse effect associated with all FGAs is tardive dyskinesia (TD) . The cumulative incidence of FGA-induced TD is about 5% of patients per year of treatment . Second-generation antipsychotics . The first SGA was clozapine . Clozapine is the only SGA that has been approved for the treatment of positive symptoms resistant to other antipsychotics (Case history 10.1) . It is also effective for alleviating negative symptoms secondary to positive symptoms, EPS or dysphoric affect . Clozapine has not been shown to be effective for primary negative symptoms . Clozapine has been found to reduce suicidal ideation in schizophrenia and to reduce symptoms of hostility and violent behaviors . The unique pharmacological properties of clozapine may be related to its superior efficacy for positive symptoms and other illness dimensions . Adverse effects . Although clozapine causes few EPS and little TD, it does have a number of adverse effects that limit its use . However, the most clinically important adverse effects may be the substantial weight gain and disruptions of glucose and lipid metabolism that are associated with clozapine treatment . However, none of the other SGAs has yet been shown to be as effective as clozapine for treatment-resistant positive symptoms . There is little evidence to suggest that these agents are effective for primary negative symptoms, though they may be of some benefit for treating secondary negative symptoms . Choosing the right drug . However, there were no efficacy differences among perphenazine and the other SGAs . Personalized drug selection . Treatment history, medical history and medical risk factors must all be factored into the treatment decision . There is no single drug that suits all patients . Treatment of negative symptoms . The treatment of negative symptoms is a major challenge facing clinicians . The limited efficacy of antipsychotics has led to the investigation of alternative treatments for negative symptoms . Various approaches have been attempted based on specific neurochemical hypotheses of the pathophysiology of negative symptoms . In pilot studies, these agents were shown to be effective in ameliorating persistent negative symptoms . However, in a large multicenter study, neither glycine nor D-cycloserine was found to be more effective than placebo for these symptoms . Other pharmacological approaches for the treatment of negative symptoms include the use of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and other antidepressants, including mirtazapine, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors . Finally, there is emerging evidence that drugs that act at the alpha-7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor may have benefit for negative symptoms . Treatment of cognitive impairments . FGAs have limited effects on the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia . In the CATIE study, which compared perphenazine with four different SGAs, there were no differences in efficacy after 2 months of treatment; however, participants randomized to perphenazine did significantly better after 18 months of treatment . To date, however, no drug has been approved for this indication . Treatment-resistant schizophrenia . A number of agents have been used in combination with ongoing antipsychotic treatment in an attempt to alleviate these symptoms . Antiepileptics, antidepressants and benzodiazepines may be more effective for the treatment of persistent symptoms of anxiety, depression, hostility or mania . The most common practice is to add a second antipsychotic medication in patients with residual positive symptoms . ",First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are effective treatments for the acute phase and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. The long-acting injectable (depot) forms of FGAs and SGAs are useful for patients who are non-adherent to their medications. Clozapine is the only SGA that is effective for positive symptoms resistant to other antipsychotics. SGAs other than clozapine have become the first-line treatments for acute psychotic episodes and maintenance therapy. FGAs and SGAs are relatively effective for treating secondary negative symptoms but are not effective in treating primary negative symptoms and have limited effects on the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. Add-on treatments for people with residual positive symptoms have not been clearly demonstrated to be effective.
9781908541796,chapter10,"There are four broad treatment modalities for lymphoma . high-dose therapy with stem-cell transplantation . Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill or slow the rate of growth of cancer cells . It works by targeting cells that are growing and dividing and that have therefore activated a complex cellular mechanism called the cell cycle (Figure 10.1) . Activation of the cell cycle is a characteristic feature of cancer cells and is seen only in a limited number of normal cells in the adult human body . There are a wide variety of chemotherapy drugs (exempli gratia fludarabine, vincristine and vinblastine) that target cells in the cell cycle, some of which work in a stage-specific manner . These drugs therefore act during the M phase of the cell cycle . It has been appreciated for some time that using a combination of drugs that act at different points in the cell cycle (and some which are not stage specific) has a greater overall effect on the cancer cell . General side effects . Chemotherapy has a number of general side effects (Table 10.1) . Most of these effects can be explained by the action of chemotherapy on the relatively few healthy cells that normally have an active cell cycle . Cells in hair follicles, the gut lining, the testicle and the bone marrow fall into this category . Although these are general side effects of chemotherapy, they occur to differing extents according to the chemotherapy agent, regimen and dose . The side effect of most concern is bone-marrow suppression, which is often monitored during chemotherapy with full blood counts . Possibly the most debilitating of all general side effects of chemotherapy is fatigue . Side effects specific to individual chemotherapy agents . As well as causing general side effects, individual agents are associated with specific complications (Table 10.2) . The development of some of these side effects may necessitate changes to treatment . Routes of chemotherapy administration . The reservoir is generally well tolerated and convenient, but infection is a risk . External-beam radiotherapy is by far the most common radiotherapy for lymphomas . Side effects of radiotherapy generally depend on the site being irradiated . Early side effects (Table 10.3) . The normal function of antibodies is to serve as adaptor molecules, recruiting cells and molecules of the immune system to fight foreign cells, such as bacteria . Antibodies have long been regarded as potentially useful in the treatment of cancer, because they can recognize specific molecules and can bind to specific cells that express these molecules . If cancer-specific molecules could be identified then antibodies could be used to either target treatment to cancer cells, or recruit the power of the immune system to attack such cells . When rituximab binds to target cells, it sensitizes them to chemotherapy and recruits components of the immune system (Figure 10.5) . Rituximab has been shown to be effective in both high- and low-grade B-cell NHL . Monoclonal antibodies can also be modified by the addition of other agents, which can enhance their activity and 'target' other anti-cancer agents directly to the lymphoma cell . High-dose therapy with stem-cell transplantation . In general, the higher the dose of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the greater the number of lymphoma cells that is destroyed . The major dose-limiting side effect is bone-marrow suppression . The patient's own stem cells can be collected before the high-dose therapy . These cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until required . Cell collection . Autologous stem-cell transplantation is most frequently used in the treatment of lymphoma . Transplantation in chemoresistant disease is generally unsuccessful . For the transplant procedure (Figure 10.6), patients first receive high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy . The side effects of autologous transplantation are generally due to the chemotherapy . Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, like autologous transplantation, uses chemotherapy or radiotherapy to kill the lymphoma cells . However, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation also uses the graft-versus-lymphoma effect to attack any residual cells . Previously, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation always used very high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before infusing the stem cells . Finally, a number of agents are being tested that specifically inhibit proteins that prevent cells from dying . ","The treatment of lymphoma often involves multiple modalities: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and/or high-dose therapy with stem-cell support. Chemotherapy is administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously or intrathecally. Some side effects are common to all chemotherapy agents, such as fatigue, nausea and bone-marrow suppression, but some are agent specific. For complex chemotherapy regimens, indwelling venous catheters are often used but they carry the risks of infection and thrombosis. Radiotherapy kills cells by causing damage to the DNA. Side effects of radiotherapy include damage to local tissues in the radiation field and an increased risk of secondary cancers. These effects are minimized by using fractions (which also increases efficacy) and by careful planning. Monoclonal antibody therapy with rituximab (anti-CD20) has revolutionized the treatment of both high- and low-grade lymphomas, and indications for this agent are likely to expand. High-dose therapy with autologous stem-cell support is useful for patients with certain types of relapsed lymphoma and may be indicated as part of first-line therapy for very aggressive lymphomas. High-dose therapy with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is a toxic procedure, but it may result in cure, particularly in cases of low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A number of small-molecule pathway inhibitors are currently in development, several of which show very encouraging activity."
9781912776238,ch1,"Biological medicines (biologics) are drugs derived or extracted from living systems, usually modified bacteria, fungi or animal cells; the three main categories are listed in Table 1.1 . This is reflected in the inclusion of biologics in the WHO list of essential medicines . Biologics are inherently more expensive than past-generation medicines; they represent the result of costly investment in research and development and are manufactured using cellular-based technologies and utilizing gene expression . The combination of medical benefit but high costs for biologics creates the need for biosimilars . Costs and economics . The transition from the era of small molecule drugs to that of the biologics has markedly increased drug expenditure - and especially so for cancer . The high prices of biologics are justified by manufacturers on the basis of the investment in discovery, development and production . Biological agents represent the largest growth in pharmaceutical innovation, with new agents submitted for approval annually . Almost 90% of those therapies in development were targeted biological treatments . The current cost of biologics is rising quickly - threatening the sustainability of healthcare . The result has been problems with access to innovative medicines . Access to biological drugs, whether anti-inflammatory or cancer, is strongly associated with national wealth . Generic and biosimilar medicines . Although chemical and biological drugs are both pharmaceutical products, they are very different when comparing their manufacturing, chemical structure and modes of action (Table 1.3) . Chemical drugs have a well-defined structure, whereas that of biotechnological medicines is much more complex and heterogeneous . Chemical drugs are usually easy to reproduce given that their structure is precisely defined and expressed by the chemical formula . As they are proteins, biologics are very sensitive to enzymatic degradation - requiring most biologics to be injected or inhaled to avoid digestion in the gut while chemical drugs are typically oral medicines . Chemical drugs are also much more stable than biological drugs, which are sensitive to changes in physical conditions . To develop a biologic, a manufacturer creates their own unique cell line through genetic engineering to preferentially express the recombinant gene for the protein product . The cell line is often constructed with proprietary DNA expression vector systems; given this fact, no two biologics will be exactly alike . The cell line is tested for product integrity, activity and overall quality . Importantly, minor variations could produce vastly different products as the process is extremely sensitive to changes in both manufacturing and production . The result is that, unlike conventional small molecule drugs, identical copies of biologics cannot be created - by definition, copies can only ever be 'similar' . Biologics in malignancies are helpfully divided into supportive care drugs and direct anti-cancer therapeutics . Variability in structure . To understand biosimilars you first need to understand biologics - for they have properties that are very different to the synthetic chemical drugs that preceded them . This variability has two main sources: inherent microheterogeneity and manufacturing process change . The primary amino acid structure of the drug remains identical, but changes such as glycosylation occur to the protein after translation from RNA to protein sequence in the host cell . Manufacturing process change . Biotechnology evolves quickly; each year brings developments in analytics, higher yielding cell lines and more efficient manufacturing processes that offer manufacturers the chance to make better versions of established biologics at lower prices . For this reason, most biological drugs undergo regular manufacturing process changes over the lifetime of a drug and so the product may not always remain identical over time . The manufacturing process can affect important aspects of the structure of a biological drug; a copied biologic can never therefore be entirely identical to the original reference product . Thus, the active substance of a biosimilar and its reference medicine is almost the same biological substance, but there may be minor differences as a result of their complex nature and production methods . For a biosimilar to be approved, this variability, and any differences between the biosimilar and the reference biologic, have to have been shown not to affect safety or effectiveness . In addition, manufacturing processes change frequently over the life of a biologic, adding to the potential for variability . Changes in manufacturing risks the introduction of more significant variation in the tertiary structure of a biologic, known as 'step changes' (see Figure 1.3) . Comparability of the drug before and after a step change needs to be demonstrated to assure regulators that safety and efficacy have not changed . ","Biologics are typically proteins, ranging in size from simple proteins to large complex monoclonal antibodies. They are produced using living cell lines. All biologics have inherent variability, which creates batch-to-batch variability for all products. Furthermore, biologics themselves show inherent variation between batches (microheterogeneity), such that no batch is identical to previous batches. Biosimilars are highly similar, but not identical, to their reference (originator) biologic. The slight differences between batches of biologics, or between biologics and biosimilars, are evaluated and not expected to have any meaningful effect in clinical use. Changes to manufacturing processes can introduce significant changes to the structure of a biologic; analytics tests (and, exceptionally, new clinical trials) are required to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed for these therapies."
9781910797495,chp11,"In the past, viscera were considered insensitive to pain . There are a variety of pain syndromes thought to be maintained by the persistent activation of visceral nociceptive fibers . However, there is a common pathophysiology and symptomatic management approach to all of these syndromes . Nociceptive input from the body surface travels along somatic nerves that enter spinal roots, accounting for the clear dermatomal organization of somatic pain sensations . Visceral sensations are often accompanied by autonomic reflexes and symptoms such as nausea, sweating and malaise . silent, which are activated by inflammation . The etiology of persistent visceral pain is often not certain . However, it is clear that visceral pain is not always linked to injury or active disease . It is believed that persistent activation of visceral fibers leads to central sensitization and to visceral hyperalgesia and that, just as for hyperalgesia from chronic somatic pain, excessive activity of N -methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptors is involved in this process . Autoimmune responses and inflammation could trigger the persistent activation of visceral afferent fibers . The possibility that visceral nerve injury may give rise to persistent visceral neuropathic pain is embodied in the term 'complex regional pain syndrome' (see Chapter 5) . Symptomatic management . Treatment of visceral chronic pain syndromes is aimed at symptomatic pain management . Today, visceral pain management focuses on both pharmacological and interventional techniques . As stress can activate or worsen visceral pain syndromes, stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and integrative therapies can be helpful adjuncts . In addition, there are specific treatment modalities that are used for the treatment of specific pain syndromes . irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . interstitial cystitis . male chronic pelvic pain syndrome . Irritable bowel syndrome . As much as 20% of the adult population exhibits symptoms of IBS . It cannot be diagnosed solely from the patient's medical history . Mild symptoms of IBS usually respond to stress management and changes in diet and lifestyle . Interstitial cystitis . Interstitial cystitis is a heterogeneous chronic pain syndrome that most commonly affects women (90%) . Symptoms include pain on bladder filling, pelvic pain and urinary urgency and frequency . The symptoms are often exacerbated by ovulation and during periods of stress . Two types of interstitial cystitis have been identified . ulcerative with bladder lesions, which responds better to therapies targeted at the bladder . These criteria were never meant to be a gold standard for diagnosis, but they are often used as such . To be diagnosed with interstitial cystitis for research purposes, patients must have glomerulations or Hunner's ulcer on cystoscopic examination, and either bladder pain or urinary urgency in the absence of other diseases that could cause the symptoms . Hydrodistention of the bladder, intravesical instillation therapy and transurethral resection of diseased bladder tissue have all been used to treat interstitial cystitis . However, the effectiveness of these therapies has not been rigorously evaluated . Tanezumab, a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for nerve growth factor (NGF), which prevents toxins interacting with nociceptive neurons in the bladder, has shown promise in reducing pain and urgency in women with interstitial cystitis, but not in men with pelvic pain . Further medication studies are needed . Male chronic pelvic pain syndrome . The diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain syndrome is made in men who complain of chronic pelvic pain but who have an unrevealing examination and work-up . Interstitial cystitis (see above) and male chronic pelvic pain syndrome may be the same syndrome . Endometriosis is a common gynecologic condition that produces cyclical pain . Women complain of severe dysmenorrhea, focal pelvic tenderness and dyspareunia . In many women, endometriosis is a self-limiting disease; however, in others the biological behavior is much more unpredictable . Medical therapy after surgical treatment reduces pain substantially, but trials have shown no difference postoperatively at 6 months if medical therapy is used or not . Although the efficacy of a variety of treatments has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, only 40-70% of women with severe cases of endometriosis become pain free . ","Visceral pain results from activation of sensory afferent nerves that innervate the stomach, kidney, gallbladder, urinary bladder, intestines, pancreas and other visceral organs. Sensations arising from visceral stimulation are generally more diffuse, more difficult to localize and more unpleasant than those associated with somatic pain. Visceral pain is more likely than somatic pain to be associated with autonomic signs such as pallor and sweating, or symptoms such as nausea. Pain syndromes such as male chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis, endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome are thought to be maintained by the persistent activation of visceral fibers, and central sensitization. Management includes identifying and avoiding factors that aggravate the underlying condition and individual clinical trials of medication. Neuromodulatory techniques have been reported as helpful in selected cases."
9781908541024,ch_4,"The principal components of preoperative assessment of patients with brain tumor are the history, physical examination and imaging . MRI provides superior images of tumor location and extent, and of surrounding normal neurovascular structures . Intraoperative ultrasound is valuable in localizing subcortical tumors . Complications following craniotomy for tumor resection are common (occurring in 25-35% of cases), and are listed in Table 3.2 . Elderly infirm patients are most susceptible to these morbidities . Radiotherapy targets actively dividing cells, with tumor cell death being achieved via induction of DNA damage . The goal of radiotherapy is to achieve maximal tumor control while sparing normal structures from the toxicities of irradiation . The efficacy of radiotherapy depends on the delivery of adequate doses of radiation to the target tissue within the brain . Radiotherapy is one of the most effective treatments for brain tumors . Most tumors, including gliomas, cannot be cured by radiotherapy . The toxic effects of radiotherapy on surrounding normal neurovascular structures limits the total dose of radiotherapy that can safely be administered to the target tumor . Attempts to improve tumor cell kill rates while preserving normal tissues have included further manipulation of the dose and schedule of radiotherapy . Radiotherapeutic techniques . CT or magnetic resonance scans provide delineation of tumor so that radiation can be delivered accurately to the appropriate target, including a margin of presumed microscopic tumor extension . For most brain tumors, radiotherapy is considered palliative because it cannot achieve a cure . External-beam radiotherapy is the most common technique for administering irradiation to brain tumors . Treatment is administered in multiple equal doses, usually 25-30 doses for patients with gliomas . Stereotactic radiotherapy is a precise technique for delivery of external-beam radiotherapy . Interstitial radiotherapy involves implantation of radiation sources directly into the tumor . Late delayed toxicities . Future radiotherapy trends . Radiotherapy is likely to remain an indispensable treatment modality for brain tumors . Advances will probably be in the realm of novel techniques for delivering increased doses of radiotherapy to the tumor, while limiting toxicity to surrounding normal structures . The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with brain tumors is expanding . Many pediatric intracranial tumors are treated primarily with chemotherapy for two reasons . First, tumors common in the pediatric population, such as medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), are highly chemosensitive . Chemotherapy is also assuming increasing importance in the management of adults with malignant brain tumors . A number of inherent biological issues have hindered the development of effective chemotherapies for primary brain tumors . In the normal adult brain, the only cells undergoing division are endothelial cells . For a given tumor, the proportion of cells undergoing division, the rate of this division and the rate of tumor cell death determine tumor growth . Theoretically, the most rapidly growing tumors should be most sensitive to the damaging effects of chemotherapy . Drug resistance . This development of drug resistance is a common reason for failure of chemotherapy . This enzyme is present in normal cells and brain tumors, and may explain the development of resistance to alkylating agents that is commonly observed in patients with brain tumors . The use of chemotherapy in patients with brain tumors is limited by the side effects of these compounds . Drug delivery . To be effective, chemotherapy must reach its target . Most drugs for brain tumors are administered orally or intravenously . Agents that are commonly administered by mouth for brain tumors include the alkylating drugs temozolomide and lomustine (CCNU) . Concerns with oral delivery include variable absorption from the gut and patient compliance . As mentioned earlier, the blood-brain barrier presents a challenge to drug delivery in patients with brain tumors . Specific agents . Table 3.3 lists agents commonly used for brain cancer . These drugs have modest activity against brain tumors . Nitrosoureas have, until recently, been the most widely used group of drugs for patients with brain tumors . These agents can be administered intra-arterially, but are more commonly given intravenously . New agents . Novel therapies that target growth factor signaling pathways, angiogenesis and tumor invasion are presently undergoing clinical investigation in patients with brain tumors . ","MRI can suggest a diagnosis of a brain tumor, but surgery is always necessary to provide tissue for pathological diagnosis (except in the case of diffuse pontine glioma). Stereotactic biopsy is a safe procedure for obtaining diagnostic tissue, but sampling error may result in the tumor grade being underestimated. Image-guided surgery facilitates radical resection of intracranial tumors. Elderly patients with poor neurological function are at highest risk of morbidity and mortality following craniotomy for tumor resection. Following surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment for long-term control of most intracranial neoplasms. Radiotherapy is associated with considerable brain side effects, including late toxicities such as dementia and cerebral radionecrosis. Conformal radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy are emerging techniques designed to provide maximal radiation dose to the tumor while sparing normal surrounding tissues. Inherent or acquired drug resistance and the blood-brain barrier are important factors limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with brain tumors. The chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide has revolutionized the treatment of gliomas, and is now firmly established as a component of initial management for glioblastoma. Novel agents that target angiogenesis are the most promising of targeted therapies for malignant gliomas."
9781912776818,hh-4,"Pregnancy is a well-established trigger for TTP, accounting for 5-10% of all cases of TTP in UK and French registries . In cases of TTP, however, ADAMTS13 activity falls to a critically low level . Meanwhile, pregnancy-induced changes may trigger iTTP . Onset of TTP can occur throughout pregnancy and into the postpartum period . Presentation was commonest in the second trimester in 42 de novo presentations reported in the French registry, whereas it was most common in the third trimester and postpartum period in 52 UK cases of de novo and relapsing TTP . Of 42 French cases reported, 32 occurred in first pregnancies and 29 of the 42 had no discernible trigger other than pregnancy . Presenting features are generally similar to those seen in non-pregnancy cases, though associated hypertension and proteinuria is often found, which can lead, erroneously, to a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia . Late-onset cTTP accounted for 66% (23/35) of UK cases of pregnancy-associated initial presentations of TTP and 24% (10/42) of French cases . As is the case in non-pregnancy presentations, congenital cases cannot be distinguished from immune cases on the basis of clinical features alone . First, cTTP nearly always presents in the first pregnancy, whereas iTTP can present initially in subsequent pregnancies . Third, a predominance of neurological symptoms was described in UK congenital cases compared with immune-mediated cases . Classic presentation of acute TTP . Various international and national TTP registries have allowed us to understand how TTP typically presents . The most common presentation of acute TTP is a previously healthy young to middle-aged adult with MAHA, severe thrombocytopenia and features of end-organ damage . Renal symptoms . Gastrointestinal symptoms, presumably resulting from intestinal ischemia, are also commonly reported in TTP . Other symptoms . In addition to the specific manifestations of TTP, individuals may demonstrate features of an underlying cause or trigger (though more than 50% of cases are idiopathic) . Atypical presentations in adulthood . The spectrum of severity of presentation in TTP is marked . Although TTP usually first presents in young to middle-aged adults, de novo presentation in the elderly is seen . Childhood and adolescent onset . Onset of TTP in childhood or adolescence is also seen, though less commonly than in adulthood, accounting for approximately 10% of all first presentations of TTP . The major difference is the higher proportion of cTTP cases . While about 98% of cases of TTP presenting in adulthood are immune-mediated, only about two-thirds of cases of childhood-onset TTP are immune-mediated . The presentation of cTTP is discussed on pages 18-20 . The presentation of iTTP in children and adolescents was the subject of a French series of 45 cases . The clinical presentation mirrored that seen in adults, with MAHA and thrombocytopenia (usually severe) in all cases, fever in 36% and end-organ ischemic damage in 64% . Association with other autoimmune diseases . The most commonly associated autoimmune condition is SLE . The French study revealed 26 cases of SLE in 261 cases of TTP . Not all cases of thrombotic microangiopathy associated with connective tissue disorders are TTP, however: in a Japanese series of 127 cases, only a minority had severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . However, through the analysis of registry data,, , it is now well established that clinical presentation is diverse, with a substantial proportion of cTTP cases actually presenting in adulthood, especially in the context of pregnancy . While all cases have persistent severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, additional triggers such as infection or pregnancy are required to provoke acute symptoms of overt TTP . Of 73 UK TTP Registry cases of cTTP, 38% initially presented in childhood/adolescence, as did 58% of 43 Japanese cases . Meanwhile, 62% of cases of cTTP in the UK Registry were diagnosed in adulthood, with a median age at diagnosis of 31 years . Of note, just over two-thirds of these diagnoses in adulthood were associated with pregnancy . End-organ damage in cTTP . Subacute features of cTTP . ","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) usually presents acutely in previously healthy adults with diverse features resulting from microvascular thrombosis: (1) microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; (2) thrombocytopenia; and (3) end-organ damage. The brain, heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the most commonly affected end organs. Neurological symptoms are the most common. Congenital TTP is a much more common cause of TTP in childhood/adolescence and in pregnancy than in non-pregnant adults. Acute presentations of congenital TTP cannot generally be distinguished from immune-mediated TTP on the basis of presenting features, though some individuals have chronic subacute symptoms. Pregnancy is a trigger for TTP, especially the congenital form. This should be considered as a potential cause for unexplained fetal growth restriction or stillbirth, unexplained thrombocytopenia in pregnancy and atypical/severe cases of pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count)."
9781910797471,ch10,"Stem cell therapy . Stem cell therapy remains a promising treatment for patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by coronary ischemia/infarction . Intracoronary or intramyocardial injections of skeletal myoblasts or bone-marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMSCs) have led to a modest improvement in cardiac performance in some studies, including improvement in the LVEF and reduction in the size of scar tissue and cardiac volume . However, the clinical effect of such therapies has not yet been proven . The therapy appears to be well tolerated in patients after recent myocardial infarction (MI), but a proarrhythmic effect of cell therapy has been observed in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) . The recent CHART-1 trial was the largest multicenter and multinational study of stem cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF less than 35% and worsening HF (class III/IV within the preceding 12 months) . The primary efficacy endpoint was neutral but the exploratory analyses suggested a benefit (trends in reduction of clinical endpoints, and improvement in quality of life and physical fitness) in a large subset of the population defined by the degree of LV dilation and a lower number of injections . In addition, intracoronary administration of BMSCs seems to be associated with improvements in cardiac contractile and microvascular function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy . However, stem cell therapy is not yet ready to become a mainstay of clinical practice . Phrenic nerve stimulation in patients with central sleep apnea . This is an alternative approach to the treatment of patients with central sleep apnea (CSA), designed to restore a physiological breathing pattern throughout sleep . It uses a fully implantable system with transvenous leads designed for the long-term application of transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation (The Remedē System, Respicardia) . The system is fully automated, thereby eliminating patient non-adherence . It works by stimulating the diaphragm during sleep to stabilize gas exchange and maintain normal breathing . It has recently been shown to stabilize the breathing pattern, reduce the number of apneic events, improve oxygen saturation and increase end-tidal carbon dioxide without suppressing the intrinsic drive to breathe . Future large studies in patients with HF and CSA are awaited . Patiromer - a new treatment for chronic hyperkalemia . Hyperkalemia is common in patients receiving HF medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone or eplerenone, and often limits their use . Management of hyperkalemia in these patients is often challenging and comprises dietary restriction and dose reduction or withdrawal of the offending agent . Potassium-binding resins, such as resonium A (sodium polystyrene sulfonate) and calcium resonium (calcium polystyrene sulfonate) are commonly used in the management of chronic hyperkalemia . However, high quality evidence of the effectiveness of these agents is lacking . The most common adverse effects are constipation (11%) and hypokalemia (3%) . Short-term studies have confirmed its efficacy in maintaining normokalemia in patients treated with HF medications . Subcutaneous furosemide . For patients with recurrent fluid overload, intravenous administration in a hospital setting is the only licensed choice, although in some countries off-label subcutaneous furosemide has been used for several years in the palliative care setting . A new formulation of subcutaneous furosemide that uses a dedicated sc2Wear™ infusor pump has been developed . The drug pH has been reduced to a neutral level to minimize the risk of local irritation or discomfort . Subcutaneous furosemide allows greater flexibility of administration, avoids the need for intravenous placement and potentially reduces the cost of care . Ongoing studies are awaited to establish its application and cost-effectiveness in patients with chronic HF . ","Stem cell therapy has demonstrated a modest improvement in cardiac performance in some studies, but the clinical effect of such therapies has not yet been proven. A fully implantable, automated, phrenic nerve stimulation system is an alternative approach to the treatment of patients with central sleep apnea. Early findings are promising, and the results of ongoing trials in patients with HF are awaited. In short-term studies, patiromer, a non-absorbable compound that predominantly binds to potassium in the colon and exchanges it for calcium, has demonstrated efficacy in managing hyperkalemia in patients treated with HF medications. A new formulation of subcutaneous furosemide delivered via a dedicated device has been developed."
9781910797662,ch02,"The histological types of primary carcinoma that occur in the bladder are shown in Table 2.1 . It accounts for almost 90% of the bladder cancers that occur in industrialized countries such as the USA and the UK, and most discussion of bladder cancer relates to this type . Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is an additional and important type seen in about 10% of cases (sometimes as secondary CIS associated with papillary UC) . CIS is a flat, intraepithelial, high-grade carcinoma, often with increased numbers of mitotic structures . Coexistent CIS and papillary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer confers a worse prognosis than papillary disease alone . The classification of the tumor depends on the dominant histological type . This stem cell type has features of UC as well as showing squamous and glandular differentiation within individual tumor cells . This may explain why metastases with variant histology (exempli gratia as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) are seen in patients with pure UC primary tumors . It accounts for 5-10% of bladder cancers in the USA and UK . Adenocarcinoma is rare, accounting for about 2% of bladder cancers . The remainder of adenocarcinomas are associated with bladder exstrophy or are non-urachal in origin . Adenocarcinomas are usually solitary, high grade and ulcerative . Any bladder adenocarcinoma may be mucin-producing . Many patients with adenocarcinoma have poor prognosis because the tumor is already at an advanced stage at diagnosis . Micropapillary cancer (Figure 2.2) is a particularly aggressive form of high-grade UC and is associated with a high risk of early muscle invasion and metastasis . Small-cell neuroendocrine bladder cancer is similar to the more common small-cell cancer of the lung . This histological pattern is associated with rapid growth and early metastasis, and may occur as a pure variant or mixed with typical UC . The cells have a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and grow in sheets or nests of cells . This variant should be distinguished from undifferentiated UC, which is the least differentiated of the UCs . Sarcomatoid bladder cancer is a rare variant, accounting for 0.3% of cases . Lymphoepithelial-like bladder cancer accounts for 0.4-1.3% of bladder cancers . About 3% of bladder cancers contain this variant . Nested variant urothelial cancer is also rare, accounting for 0.3% of invasive cancers . Nested variant is not associated with overlying CIS, and cannot be classified as high grade . Staging and grading . The current grading system, introduced in 2004, stratifies bladder cancer into low and high grade, replacing the WHO 1973 three-grade system, as illustrated in Figure 2.6 . Approximately 40% of former grade 2 tumors are reclassified as high grade in the current system, and grade 1 tumors are stratified into papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential or low-grade cancers . Among patients who do experience recurrence, 20-30% of tumors (usually high grade) may progress to a higher stage . Conversely, 40% of patients who have an initial UC of the renal pelvis will subsequently develop a UC in the bladder . On average, muscle-invasive disease is associated with regional lymph node metastases in 25% of patients . Distant metastases are present at initial diagnosis in 5% of patients . Mortality due to UC is directly related to the pathological stage and grade of bladder cancer (Table 2.2) . For patients with T2/T3aN0M0 disease, the 5-year survival rate is 60-70%, despite radical cystectomy . In patients who experience disease progression, this occurs within 2-3 years of cystectomy in about 80% of cases . The 5-year survival rate in patients with T4 UC is only 10-20%; survival of those with T4a disease is at the upper end of this range . For patients with visceral metastases the 5-year survival rate, irrespective of chemotherapy, is only about 10% . Patients with small-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma may be cured with systemic chemotherapy and cystectomy or radiation if there is no residual small-cell carcinoma . ","Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histology of bladder cancer. Variant histology is common and is usually seen as a mixed pattern with conventional urothelial cancer. Low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors may recur but progression to muscle invasion occurs in < 5% of cases. High-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer will progress if not adequately treated with resection and intravesical therapy. Carcinoma in situ, whether primary or associated with Ta or T1 papillary tumor, is a high-risk cancer. Up to 30% of patients with high-grade non-muscle-invasive tumors and up to 70% with muscle-invasive disease may die of bladder cancer."
9781905832729,ch_3,"The onset of urinary symptoms, their duration and severity, and the time(s) when they occur, should be recorded . Filling symptoms . Urgency implies detrusor overactivity, but can also occur if there is an underlying bladder inflammatory disorder . Storage symptoms . It can occur several times a day or week . Mixed incontinence is the coexistence of stress incontinence with urgency incontinence or urge symptoms . Pressure (bladder, suprapubic) is the sensation that the bladder is full and the urge to void will occur shortly . Its causes include incomplete bladder emptying . Voiding/emptying symptoms . These symptoms are more often seen in men than in women . Approximately 80% of men experience this symptom at some time, and it can present at any age . All patients presenting with bladder symptoms should undergo a full physical examination, including neurological examination . Neurological conditions that are associated with bladder problems (such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease or spinal injury) are usually obvious when the patient first presents . Abdominal examination . Abdominal examination or suprapubic percussion may identify a distended bladder (if more than 300 mL in bladder) or a pelvic mass that is compressing the bladder . Ideally, this should be done with a full bladder . Symptoms of bladder overactivity can be caused by locally advanced prostate cancer or an enlarged prostate . Further investigations . Further investigation is usually necessary to confirm the cause of bladder symptoms . Psychological and cognitive assessment . The patient should be assessed for clinical depression, which can compromise the success of behavioral and surgical treatments . Functional and environment assessment . Environmental assessment should include identifying the location of the toilet . There are a number of ways to assess the impact of incontinence symptoms on a patient's quality of life . The patient records the times and volumes of all voids over a specific time period, which should be at least 24 hours so that both day and night are included . Large volume (101+ mL) - soaks through clothing and onto floor or furniture and usually is the entire bladder volume . The frequency/volume bladder record is also useful for assessing and monitoring treatment, and to demonstrate the benefits of treatment to a patient . treatment failure . complex mixed lower urinary tract symptoms . before incontinence surgery . symptoms suggesting detrusor overactivity . voiding symptoms . Complex mixed lower urinary tract symptoms or treatment failure . Some patients present with such a complicated history that it is impossible to make any judgment as to the cause of their symptoms . The patient should undergo urodynamic investigation so that appropriate treatment can be offered . Before incontinence surgery . Symptoms suggesting detrusor overactivity . Most patients with symptoms suggestive of detrusor overactivity can be treated empirically . Thus, a patient with symptoms of detrusor overactivity may have a normal urodynamic study . Patients with neurological disease and lower urinary tract symptoms are at risk of neurogenic detrusor overactivity, low compliance and DSD . Normal findings are . Cystometry records bladder pressure during filling and voiding, with the aim of explaining a clinical problem in pathophysiological terms . Filling rates are classified as follows . Capacity - the volume infused during filling is measured, and hence the bladder volume is calculated . Sensation - the patient is asked to comment on bladder sensation during filling . Urgency - this is a sudden compelling desire to void, described particularly by patients with detrusor overactivity or inflammatory bladder conditions . Little or no pressure change occurs during normal filling in a patient with normal compliance . Compliance may be reduced if bladder pathology is present or in patients with neurological disease or injury . Stress incontinence can be demonstrated by asking the patient to cough during the filling phase . Voiding cystometry (pressure-flow study) . When filling cystometry has been completed, the filling line is removed as described above, and the patient is asked to void with the bladder and abdominal pressure transducers still in place . If bladder filling symptoms are present, the volume of fluid infused should be noted . Diagnostic cystourethroscopy is indicated in cases of recurrent UTI, hematuria, bladder pain and suspected bladder injury . ","Lower urinary tract symptoms are key in the diagnosis of bladder disorders: onset, duration and severity should be recorded. Urinary symptoms can relate to filling (frequency, nocturia, urgency), storage (stress incontinence, urgency incontinence, nocturnal enuresis) or voiding/emptying (hesitancy, intermittent stream, slow stream, terminal dribble, incomplete emptying). Physical examination is essential, and may include neurological examination, abdominal examination and examination of the genitals. Other assessments include cognitive and mobility evaluation, especially in the elderly. The effect of symptoms on quality of life can be assessed using self-completion questionnaires. A frequency/volume bladder record (bladder diary) is a simple and practical method to record voiding and fluid intake. Dipstick urinalysis is essential for all patients with urinary incontinence, bladder or urethral pain and is good practice in those with voiding/emptying symptoms. Positive tests should be evaluated further. Urodynamic investigation can provide a wide variety of information, but is not necessarily indicated for all patients."
9781908541024,ch_6,"This category of tumor accounts for 45-50% of all gliomas, arising most frequently in individuals aged 45-65 years . Glioblastomas usually arise in the deep white matter of the cerebrum, with the temporal and frontal lobes being the most common sites . MRI is more accurate than CT for determining tumor size and extent . Like all gliomas, glioblastomas are infiltrative tumors . Glioblastomas are highly aggressive and survival statistics remain poor . Median survival for patients offered only supportive care is approximately 14 weeks . However, aggressive treatment that includes maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy has extended median survival to approximately 15-18 months . Recently, hypermethylation of the O . The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is now established for glioblastoma . A recently completed randomized phase III study has demonstrated improved survival for patients receiving chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment . Additionally, nearly 50% of patients who had tumors with a methylated phenotype had a 2-year survival following combined modality therapy . Despite this very important therapeutic advance, most individuals with glioblastomas will experience tumor recurrence within 2 years of the initial diagnosis . Tumor recurrence is usually local and confined to the brain . At recurrence, further surgery and chemotherapy can extend life in a minority of patients . Studies are under way to further define the use of bevacizumab in patients with glioblastoma, including very large phase III trials in patients with newly diagnosed disease . These tumors tend to arise in individuals aged 35-55 years . The use of adjuvant chemotherapy is more common in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas than in those with glioblastomas, but remains controversial . Despite initial attempts at control, recurrence is expected, usually as a glioblastoma . At recurrence, the treatment options include further surgery, chemotherapy or experimental agents . Low-grade astrocytoma . Most patients present with seizures only and have no fixed neurological deficits . These factors include age greater than 40 years, fixed neurological deficits, and tumor enhancement or mass effect on imaging . Chemotherapy has no established role in the initial management of low-grade astrocytomas, although trials in this area are under way . However, these tumors have the potential for dedifferentiation to a more malignant phenotype . Anaplastic oligodendroglioma and oligodendroglioma . This co-deletion is an early event in the development of these tumors, and is also present in the majority of low-grade oligodendrogliomas . The PCV regimen has traditionally been the chemotherapy of choice for patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors . Low-grade oligodendrogliomas are also sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents, although the role of chemotherapy in patients with this tumor type is less established . Pilocytic astrocytoma . Pilocytic astrocytomas account for fewer than 5% of gliomas . Signs and symptoms are related to tumor location, and are usually insidious because these tumors are indolent . Diagnosis is established pathologically . Complete surgical resection of pilocytic astrocytomas can be curative, and has been associated with 95% disease-free survival at 25 years for patients with cerebellar tumors . For patients with supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas, 10-year survival rates of 80-100% have been reported following surgery . For very young patients who should not receive irradiation, chemotherapy has been administered with reasonable response rates but poor survival . The primary therapy for these tumors is surgical, and a complete resection can be curative . For malignant tumors, or recurrent ependymomas following surgical resection, radiotherapy is often indicated . The role of chemotherapy in this disease is poorly defined . More commonly, chemotherapy is given for progressive or recurrent disease following surgical and radiotherapeutic failure, and has only modest impact . Common presenting symptoms include seizures, focal neurological deficits and headache . However, recently identified molecular prognostic factors are assuming increasing importance in the classification and treatment of selected gliomas . ","The prognosis for patients with malignant gliomas is influenced most by histology, tumor grade and age. Increasingly, genetic aberrations are being identified at the molecular level in a variety of gliomas, and these abnormalities will assume substantial prognostic and therapeutic importance as greater knowledge of their significance is acquired. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive of all gliomas. Surgery is the principal initial treatment for gliomas. The benefit of extensive surgery versus limited resection or biopsy is controversial. Postoperative radiotherapy delays tumor progression and prolongs life for patients with malignant glioma. Concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy with radiotherapy for glioblastoma is now the standard treatment for most patients with glioblastoma following surgery. This treatment is associated with significant long-term survival in responding patients. Patients who have tumors with hypermethylated O-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promotor regions appear to benefit most from this treatment strategy. The role of this regimen is unclear in elderly patients or patients with poor performance status with glioblastoma. The use of this regimen in anaplastic gliomas is being investigated. Chemotherapy is often administered for tumor recurrence or progression but is palliative and of limited benefit for most patients. More effective drugs are needed for this indication. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a chemosensitive tumor. The appropriate timing of chemotherapy is controversial. Anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors that harbor co-deletion of 1p and 19q have a more favorable prognosis, and respond more consistently and durably to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Observation may be an appropriate initial strategy for patients with low-grade gliomas. The timing and extent of surgery for low-grade glioma is controversial. Increasingly, radiotherapy is deferred until clinically necessary, and lower doses are usually administered. The role of initial chemotherapy for low-grade gliomas is unclear, but is an option for a subset of patients with this diagnosis."
9781908541963,chapter10,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma, HCC) is a malignancy of hepatocytes . HCC is a common cause of mortality in the developing world . Although currently less common in the developed world, the incidence is expected to rise as patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C age . Most cases of HCC occur in liver that is already cirrhotic . Thus, patients with advanced viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis or alcoholic liver disease are at risk . Hepatitis B presents a unique risk, as there is evidence that a tumor may develop in the absence of cirrhosis - presumably via direct integration of viral DNA into the host genome . Clinical presentation . HCC is difficult to diagnose until there is widespread involvement of the liver . In the absence of specific clinical findings, most hepatologists suspect HCC when there is a change in the expected clinical course of a patient with otherwise stable liver disease . Paraneoplastic syndromes related to HCC may also give clues to the diagnosis (Table 10.3) . Because of the non-specific clinical presentation, the diagnosis of HCC is typically made using serum tumor markers, imaging studies and, at times, liver biopsy . Immature (fetal) liver cells synthesize alpha fetoprotein (AFP) . Malignant hepatocytes resemble immature hepatocytes, and AFP is an important marker for HCC . A sudden rise in serum AFP or absolute levels greater than 500 ng/mL are highly suggestive of HCC . AFP is also produced during pregnancy and by some germ-cell tumors . Unfortunately, not all HCCs produce AFP; 30-40% of patients with HCC have normal AFP levels, which considerably limits the usefulness of AFP for screening . Imaging studies are particularly useful when confirming a diagnosis of HCC . CT, especially when used with rapid scanning techniques, helps to identify and stage the tumor . It has better sensitivity than ultrasonography, making it particularly useful for detecting small tumors . Many hepatologists believe that suspected HCC lesions (suspected on the basis of imaging characteristics, growth patterns and elevated AFP levels) should not be biopsied for fear that the biopsy may spread the tumor . Available data do not strongly support the efficacy of screening for HCC . Nevertheless, because there are few symptoms or objective signs of the tumor before it progresses to an incurable stage, and because screening is associated with few risks, many practitioners offer screening to their patients . Patients with established cirrhosis, particularly from viral hepatitis or hemochromatosis, are at the highest risk for HCC . If tumors are small, there is no evidence of extrahepatic spread and the patient has preserved liver function, surgical resection may be considered . Unfortunately, however, few patients with HCC have resectable tumors or sufficient hepatic reserve to tolerate a partial hepatectomy, and approximately 50% of tumors will have recurred at 5 years . Liver transplantation may be an option for some patients, provided there is no evidence of extrahepatic spread and the patient is an otherwise good candidate for transplantation (see Chapter 12) . The prognosis is best for patients with either a single small tumor (less than 5 cm) or no more than three lesions, each smaller than 3 cm . Many patients with HCC are not candidates for liver transplantation or surgical resection . Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) both embolizes the tumor (to interrupt its blood supply) and infuses chemotherapeutic agents directly into the tumor via the hepatic artery . Ablation techniques may have curative potential for small tumors . Therapy for most patients with HCC is best provided by specialized centers, where patients may be considered for inclusion in randomized controlled trials . Other primary hepatic tumors . Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy in children . It usually presents with abdominal swelling, weight loss and failure to thrive, and serum AFP is almost always elevated . Hepatoblastoma is an aggressive tumor and is associated with a poor prognosis; its response to systemic chemotherapy or radiation is inconsistent . If detected in early stages, a well-encapsulated tumor may be surgically resectable . Liver transplantation offers the best potential for long-term survival . Histologically, the tumor is characterized by numerous blood-filled cystic structures lined with malignant endothelial cells . ","Hepatocellular carcinoma is a worrisome complication of advanced liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma often has few specific symptoms or signs. Hepatocellular carcinoma should be suspected in patients with an unexpected worsening of liver disease. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is of unclear utility, but is widely practiced. Regular checking of serum alpha fetoprotein levels and hepatic ultrasound scanning are acceptable. Curative treatment by resection or transplantation is an option, but not always possible. Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, transarterial chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are all treatment options."
9781908541406,ch_15,"The former are associated with bleeding and the latter with thrombosis . Treatment is directed toward control of bleeding and suppression of the antibody (Table 13.1) . Anticoagulant antibodies arising in association with other diseases . Amyloid proteins may absorb FX, leading to a bleeding diathesis . Before starting any antithrombotic therapy it is essential to consider the balance between reducing the chances of thromboembolism and increasing the risk of bleeding in every patient . intracranial, retroperitoneal or fatal bleeding . Minor bleeding includes all other bleeding, such as skin bruising, wound hematoma, epistaxis and hematuria . In some clinical studies a bleeding index has been used to define major bleeding . Bleeding risk . The regular use of ASA (aspirin) is associated with a twofold increase in the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding . Therapy with other NSAIDs is also complicated by bleeding; some provoke more bleeding than others . This risk may be modified by the concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors . The relative risk of subarachnoid bleeding is 1.13 for patients taking ASA (aspirin), 2.04 for dipyridamole and 1.88 for the combination . The bleeding risk with this combination is slightly greater than with clopidogrel (see Table 13.5) . Most bleeding is from the gastrointestinal tract and at sites of arterial puncture . Patients receiving antiplatelet agents are at risk for early postoperative hemorrhage . Treatment of bleeding due to platelet-inhibiting agents . Bleeding due to ASA (aspirin) and NSAIDs is usually from the gastrointestinal tract and often responds to withdrawal of the drug and treatment with proton pump inhibitors . Bleeding due to longer-acting agents, such as the thienopyridines, may require platelet transfusion . Bleeding risk . The principal adverse effect of heparins is bleeding . With LMWH the rate of major bleeding is up to 3% and fatal bleeding is 0.8% . A meta-analysis of trials comparing bleeding with unfractionated heparin and LMWH found that intravenous (but not subcutaneous) unfractionated heparin was associated with more bleeding . The management of bleeding due to heparins begins with immediate discontinuation of the agent . A large dose of protamine may produce hypotension, bleeding and severe allergic reactions in certain individuals . Bleeding associated with fondaparinux has been controlled with recombinant human FVIIa, 15-90 μg/kg, and this agent may be effective for bleeding due to the FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban . Oral factor Xa inhibitors . Because these oral agents have a short half-life, bleeding generally stops within a few hours of discontinuing them . The risk of bleeding rises with increasing INR, and it rises more sharply when the INR exceeds 3.0 . Untoward bleeding would not be anticipated with INRs of 1.4 or lower . Bleeding risk . The risk of bleeding with coumarins is strongly related to the patient's vitamin K status . These drugs enhance the effect of coumarins in a variety of ways . Alcohol in small amounts increases the metabolism of coumarins, but larger quantities enhance anticoagulant effects and promote bleeding . The greatest risk for hemorrhage with coumarins is in the first month of therapy, and the risk of life-threatening bleeding is 0.5-1% per year thereafter . Treatment of bleeding due to coumarin begins with cessation of the anticoagulant . These treatments will usually control bleeding but enhance the risk of thromboembolism . Direct thrombin inhibitors . The principal adverse effect is bleeding; other side effects are nausea and dyspepsia . There are no specific antidotes for direct thrombin inhibitors; however, their relatively short half-lives usually limit the duration of bleeding . Unfortunately, the expectation that tPA would be associated with less bleeding has not been borne out by clinical practice . Patients should be warned to avoid activities that may lead to bleeding, such as heavy coughing, straining at stool or walking without assistance . However, consider infusing an antifibrinolytic agent for bleeding that is profuse or in a vulnerable area . ","Pathological anticoagulants A pathological anticoagulant should be suspected when major unprovoked bleeding occurs in a previously well person. Pharmacological anticoagulants Serious bleeding associated with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may be controlled by platelet transfusion and, if minor but troublesome, with desmopressin. A decline in hemoglobin in a patient receiving an anticoagulant should prompt an exhaustive search for a source of bleeding. Coumarins should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients with poor oral intake. The direct factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors currently available do not have specific antidotes and should be used cautiously in patients at risk for bleeding (those with renal failure, liver disease, previous stroke or history of hemorrhage). Thrombolytic agents Thrombolytic agents are associated with a risk of intracranial hemorrhage of nearly 1%; they should be administered in intensive care units and stopped immediately if signs of bleeding appear."
9781910797587,chp08,"This chapter provides an overview of the pharmacological therapies introduced in Chapter 6 (see Table 6.1) and their potential side effects . As mentioned previously, these therapies are aimed at managing the pain of osteoarthritis (OA) . It is worth considering the optimal timing of analgesia - that is, when the patient has most symptoms (see pages 87 -) . Therapies with a good safety profile . Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally well-tolerated and has long been considered a first-line analgesic for OA . However, recent studies have called into question the true benefit of paracetamol in OA . Side effects . Paracetamol is metabolized by the liver and can accumulate in patients with chronic liver disease . Side effects . Topical NSAIDs are generally very well tolerated . Low systemic levels of absorbed NSAID mean much less gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity than with oral NSAIDs . The strength of the preparations generally used in OA trials is 0.025%, and usually three or four applications a day are required . Side effects . Therapies with significant side effects . NSAIDs and COX-2 selective inhibitors . NSAIDs are used by almost 25% of people with OA, with usage often limited by toxicity or contraindications . Understanding their true usage is complicated by the availability of over-the-counter NSAIDs . Importantly, as well as being anti-inflammatory agents that work at peripheral sites (rather than in the CNS), NSAIDs are analgesics . On balance, these studies show moderate reduction in patient symptoms while the NSAID is being used . COX-2 inhibitors . Studies have shown that the short-term efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in OA is similar to that of the traditional NSAIDs . Initial endoscopy studies and subsequent clinical trials have generally supported the concept that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with fewer upper GI problems, including ulceration and serious complications . Side effects . The widespread use of NSAIDs means that significant morbidity and mortality due to these agents are encountered across communities . The side effects of these commonly used agents will be well known to most readers and are highlighted in Table 8.1 . In general, extra caution should be exercised when using these drugs in elderly patients, as there are higher incidences of important side effects, including confusion . Certainly, patients should be fully informed of the potential risks associated with these agents . Table 8.2 provides a summary of prescribing advice with respect to GI and CV risk . A safe rule is to use the lowest possible dose of drug for the shortest period of time . In the USA, certain insurers/reimbursers require evidence of prior use of the less expensive non-selective NSAIDs before providing prescription coverage for the COX-2-selective NSAIDs . Also, some traditional NSAIDs may interfere with the antiplatelet effect of ASA . However, there are still relatively few well-designed trials of opioids in OA . Side effects . The use of opioids always requires careful consideration of the patient's age, general state, comorbidities and other medications . Common problems include drowsiness and constipation, and rates of withdrawal because of side effects are high in clinical trials and probably in clinical practice . Opioids also have potential harms including addiction and overdose . How should opioids be prescribed? As with all analgesic therapies, it is sensible to start with a low dose and increase as dictated by analgesic efficacy and side effects . Opioids are recommended in all modern evidence-based OA guidelines . Previously approved for fibromyalgia, duloxetine was approved in the USA in 2010 for use in chronic musculoskeletal pain, including chronic back pain and pain due to OA . Side effects include nausea, insomnia, dizziness, dry mouth, somnolence, constipation and fatigue . Timing of pharmacological interventions . For many people with OA, symptoms are worse in the latter half of the day, and taking a short-acting agent at lunchtime and/or at evening-meal time may provide maximal short-term benefits . When people have symptoms predominantly at night, an agent with a longer half-life may be appropriate to provide sustained analgesia . The use of stronger analgesics that cause drowsiness as a side effect may be acceptable as nocturnal medications . ","Paracetamol (acetaminophen), topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin are well-tolerated early pharmacological interventions in osteoarthritis (OA). Traditional NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are effective but have a range of important side effects that must be taken into consideration, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks. Care should be taken with the use of opioids for chronic OA pain. Optimal timing of analgesia should be considered in relation to when the patient has most symptoms and the likely duration of effect of the pharmacological intervention."
9781912776238,ch8,"These committees also consider the impact of products on workflow and patient throughput, and the indications for the biosimilar within the organization . The following need to be considered at the outset . Is the biosimilar licensed for the proposed indication(s)? Will it be used for all indications or for specific ones? . The patient groups - therapeutic area, adult and pediatric? . Will it be introduced for new patients or will existing patients be switched? . Are there differences between the reference and the biosimilar in . administration type . Are there clinical data available? . Are more biosimilars planned for the same reference drug in the near future? If yes, thought needs to be given to how this will be managed to avoid inefficiencies, increased risk and loss of patient confidence . The decision-making group will have to satisfy itself of how the safety and efficacy data compare with those of the reference drug for the specific patient populations under consideration . Post-approval data, if available, may reveal differences not apparent before approval . Clinical data and immunogenicity . The amount and quality of available clinical data, particularly for the indications under consideration for formulary inclusion, and any post-approval data should be considered . If available, data from other countries should be included . Pre- and post-approval clinical data may reveal differences in immunogenic profile (such as infusion reactions, neutralizing antibodies or loss of efficacy) between approved biosimilars and their reference products . Information on immunogenic events for newly introduced biosimilar products may be limited at first . Accurate medical records for biosimilars need to be established within the organization and regular evaluations of adverse drug reactions scheduled . Product characteristics . Any differences from the reference in product characteristics (such as formulation and excipients) or compatibility (such as interference with laboratory assays or a difference in adverse events) should be considered in light of the specific patient groups in question . In addition to study data, committees may want to consider the product's prescribing information . A patient population needs a reliable and consistent supply of a biologic, given potential problems with changing products . Manufacturers of biosimilars can expect to answer enquiries about . quality-control practices . Are there differences that need to be addressed to reduce dispensing errors? . It will be necessary to easily distinguish biosimilars and biologics, so before a biosimilar is added to the formulary, the product must be clearly labeled . The product should also be easy to differentiate from other similar products . Will the IT system be able to track each biosimilar and, potentially, distill information about biosimilar-specific adverse events? . Ease of administration . The label should be clear and descriptive for patients . Any delivery device and/or container should be easy to use by health professionals and patients . Does the biosimilar take longer to administer than the reference, or is it easier to use? Are injection-site reactions more common? Are there differences in the timing of administration that might increase the indirect costs of the product? . Compatibility with compounding technology . It is prudent to consider not just compatibility of the biosimilar compared with the reference, but also whether there are differences in technician time and preparatory techniques . Is the product compatible with the compounding technology used? . The formulary committee needs to decide if a new brand stocked will be introduced for treatment-naive patients only, or whether patients will switch part way through treatment . There are economies to be made by stocking only one brand, but there are costs associated with switching that must be considered, as this involves allocating expert staff time to consulting with patients . Patient communication . As well as incorporating the patient voice into decision-making, the adoption of a biosimilar should be supported with patient communication materials . The cost of the biosimilar versus the reference product should be considered in the context of financial arrangements that favor one product or the other . Is reimbursement support available? Are there government or commercial policies that favor biosimilars over the reference products? Differences in costs between biosimilars and their reference products should be carefully evaluated in the context of manufacturer assistance programs . If the biosimilar manufacturer does not provide an assistance program similar to that of the reference product, this may weaken the case for including the biosimilar . It is also vital to consider, if applicable, differences in insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs for patients . ","A number of product characteristics and manufacturer processes need to be considered when adopting a biosimilar. A biosimilar may have effects that impact nursing time, patient comfort and ease of use, and these should be evaluated at the outset. Economic estimations should address the potential direct and indirect costs of the biosimilar versus the reference drug."
9783318066241,ch8,"Abdominal compartment syndrome . Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is the steady-state pressure maintained within the abdominal cavity . IAP is measured in patients in an intensive care unit setting via an indwelling urinary catheter (transbladder technique) and is usually 5-7 mmHg in critically ill adults . Moderate-to-severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with increased vascular permeability (resulting in interstitial edema), retroperitoneal inflammation and collections and with paralytic ileus; it may also be associated with ascites . These factors increase IAP and may result in intra-abdominal hypertension (a sustained IAP >= 12 mmHg) . Patients with intra-abdominal hypertension are at risk of developing organ failure (OF), as increased pressure in the abdomen may collapse blood vessels, resulting in gastrointestinal tract and kidney ischemia and decreased cardiac output . Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained increase in IAP (> 20 mmHg) that is associated with new organ dysfunction/failure . Very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared aggressive versus conservative treatment of pancreatitis-associated ACS . In critically ill patients with increasing IAP, some non-invasive measures may be useful . Neuromuscular blockade with artificial respiration decreases IAP by reducing abdominal musculature tone and increasing abdominal compliance . In cases of refractory intra-abdominal hypertension, and particularly in cases of organ dysfunction, percutaneous drainage of collections may decrease IAP and improve outcomes . Patients with no response can undergo abdominal decompression surgery (Figure 8.1) . Disconnected tail syndrome . central pancreatic gland necrosis may result in complete transection of the main pancreatic duct, causing pancreatic juice to leak into the retroperitoneum (Figure 8.2) . This complication is called disconnected tail syndrome (DTS) or disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome . DTS is associated with bulky retroperitoneal collections, pancreatic ascites, pancreatic pleural effusion (Figure 8.3) and/or pancreaticocutaneous fistula . There are no good-quality RCTs addressing the management of DTS . However, in cases of DTS, early removal of the stent will probably result in the collection relapsing, so the use of LAMS in this kind of endoscopic drainage is discouraged . In cases of partial main pancreatic duct disruption, retrospective data suggest that bridging of the disruption using a transpapillary pancreatic stent may improve outcomes . In refractory cases, distal pancreatectomy or pancreaticojejunostomy may be needed . Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm . AP results in local inflammation and may expose surrounding tissues to pancreatic enzymes . The debilitated vessel wall may dilate to form a pseudoaneurysm, or the vessel may bleed into a pre-existing surrounding collection meaning that the wall of the collection becomes the new wall of the pseudoaneurysm (Figure 8.4) . A case series study found that, overall, 20% of patients diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm due to acute or chronic pancreatitis died . Surgery is reserved for refractory cases . Peripancreatic vein thrombosis . Retrospective data suggest that almost 2% of patients overall, and almost 20% of patients with severe AP, develop peripancreatic vein thrombosis (PVT) . A prospective study found that 3% of patients overall and 9% of patients with moderate-to-severe AP experienced this complication . PVT is associated with local complications of AP because inflammation and local compression of the veins are important prothrombotic factors . PVT is usually an incidental finding on a contrast-enhanced CT scan performed to look for or control pancreatic or peripancreatic collections and necrosis . Left-sided portal hypertension with collateral circulation on imaging is a frequent consequence of PVT if it is not promptly treated, but bleeding due to esophageal or gastric varices is uncommon, affecting 2.2% of patients with PVT according to a retrospective study . Patients with well-established PVT (exempli gratia PVT diagnosed in an ambulatory control CT scan after discharge, and showing collateral circulation) will show little response to anticoagulation . ","Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg that is associated with new organ dysfunction/failure. When non-invasive measures fail in ACS, neuromuscular blockade with artificial respiration, percutaneous drainage or, finally, decompressive surgery may be indicated. Disconnected tail syndrome may be associated with bulky retroperitoneal collections, pancreatic ascites, pancreatic pleural effusion and/or pancreaticocutaneous fistula. If indicated, the treatment of choice for disconnected tail syndrome is long-term double-pigtail plastic stent drainage with or without transpapillary main pancreatic duct stenting. A pancreatic pseudoaneurysm should be treated with selective angiographic embolization. Although bleeding varices are uncommon, peripancreatic vein thrombosis should be diagnosed during the index hospital admission and patients should receive prompt anticoagulation therapy."
9781908541406,ch_5,"Most patients with HHT have cutaneous and visceral arteriovenous malformations; those with type 1 disease have epistaxis and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations at a younger age, while hepatic involvement is limited to those with type 2 disease . Cutaneous telangiectasias typically have small feeding vessels, blanch with pressure and bleed freely when traumatized . Lesions also occur in the nasal mucosa and conjunctivae, and telangiectasias in the retina may bleed and provoke retinal detachment . Telangiectasias are ubiquitous in the gastrointestinal tract, and chronic bleeding results in iron-deficiency anemia . Liver involvement occurs in up to one-third of patients with HHT . Recurrent bleeding from the nose should raise suspicion of HHT and prompt a careful inspection of the nasal mucosa . A variety of treatments have been proposed for HHT, but the merits of each need to be carefully assessed for a particular patient . Hormonal therapy has been helpful in some patients with HHT . Thalidomide, 100 mg daily, decreased the frequency of epistaxis in 6 of 7 patients within 1 month of treatment initiation . Hemoglobin concentrations rose in 5 of the patients without additional iron supplementation, and 4 no longer required transfusion support . The main adverse effects were constipation, loss of libido and lethargy; peripheral neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 1 patient . Local measures to control bleeding . However, bleeding recurs when the necrotic tissue sloughs . Giving an antifibrinolytic agent in conjunction with cautery may control hemorrhage . Patients with gastrointestinal bleeding often have numerous telangiectasias, so identifying the culprit bleeding lesion is difficult . Mouth bleeding, perifollicular hemorrhages, dental decay and breakdown of dental restorations also occurred . The response to therapy with vitamin C is dramatic; gum bleeding and ecchymoses subside within hours . Henoch-Schönlein purpura . Renal involvement is characterized by a crescentic proliferative glomerulonephritis . In a series of 20 patients, seven (35%) who experienced severe Henoch-Schönlein purpura in childhood progressed to renal impairment in adulthood . Once the diagnosis is established, usually by biopsy of skin or renal lesions, steroid therapy should be initiated . However, as noted above, patients may progress to renal failure despite this treatment, and plasmapheresis and other drugs such as cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil are often prescribed . Type II cryoglobulinemia occasionally occurs in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or lymphoma . Deposition of these complexes on the endothelium of small vessels leads to vascular obstruction and hemorrhage . About 75% of patients have polyarthropathy and 50% develop renal involvement, usually glomerulonephritis . Deposition of immune complexes in skin venules is associated with a palpable purpura . The lesions are typically located on the lower legs (Figure 3.4) . After 1 year of treatment, patients receiving rituximab had earlier complete remissions, a higher rate of immunologic responses, and more complete remissions of renal involvement . Several other small trials have confirmed these results . Amyloid purpura . Minor trauma, such as sneezing or putting the head in a dependent position will cause small vessels to rupture and result in skin hemorrhage (Figure 3.5) . Patients with amyloidosis may also come to medical attention as a result of proteinuria . If the diagnosis is not suspected and a renal biopsy is performed, there may be extensive retroperitoneal bleeding . Imaging of tissue amyloid deposits has recently been achieved using a murine antibody to amyloid labeled with I-124 . In one such patient, recombinant human factor VIIa provided effective hemostasis for a major surgical procedure . A different form of amyloid is found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, where it appears in plaques and in the walls of blood vessels . In an attempt to slow the progression of the disease, some patients were immunized with beta-amyloid peptide . The amyloid-laden vessels may be more sensitive to the inflammatory reaction accompanying the immunologic attack on the vascular amyloid . ","Individuals with recurrent nosebleeds and a family history of epistaxis should be carefully evaluated for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Henoch-Schönlein purpura in childhood may lead to complications in pregnancy and renal failure in adulthood. Palpable purpura, renal disease, polyarthropathy and cryoglobulinemia are usually associated with hepatitis C infection."
9781908541703,ch_10,"The clinical trial process may be our most powerful analytical tool for developing and testing new treatments . There is also good evidence that the trial process itself raises the quality of care . However, a good trial must ask a good question and be structured to provide a reasonable chance of getting a good answer . It must also be remembered that no trial can supplant good clinical observation, the insight that develops a new hypothesis or the basic scientific discovery or technological advance that prompts the trial . Should my patient enter a trial? . Many patients attending specialist centers are recruited into trials, and they often turn to their family physician for advice . Should they enter a trial? By all means, if the question is good, the design makes an answer feasible and entry does not compromise the individual patient's care . However, clinical trials place a burden on all involved, because the data must be meticulously collected and analyzed; a good trial design will make this as easy as possible . Trials can also be frustrating because the 'answer' will not be known until the study is complete . Characteristics of clinical trials . The trial must address a legitimate question to which the answer is currently unclear . In a randomized trial, this introduces the concept of 'equipoise', which means that each arm of the study has equal merit in advance of the experiment . The patient must be an informed and willing participant in the study . The patient may decline to enter the trial, or withdraw at any time during the study, without prejudicing their subsequent care . There are four clinical trial structures, each with a different purpose . The Phase I study involves a small number of participants, and provides basic pharmacological and toxicological information . It is not a test of therapeutic efficacy . However, translational research can be performed in conjunction with Phase I testing . For drugs with relatively non-toxic mechanisms of action (exempli gratia endocrine agents), Phase I studies may be carried out in healthy volunteers; trials on cancer chemotherapy agents are almost always conducted in major cancer centers and involve patients in whom all other available treatment has failed . Phase I studies are usually not randomized . The Phase II study uses Phase I data to select a range of doses . The sample size is usually 15-20 patients, but may be increased if a major response is observed . The patients usually have end-stage disease, and may have previously received many other drugs . Phase II studies are not usually randomized . The Phase III study is a randomized trial comparing the effects of different treatments, one of which represents the current 'state of the art' . Because the differences in outcome between groups are often expected to be small, these trials involve many patients; they are conducted over several years and involve many institutions in many different countries . The Phase IV study is less commonly performed . In the pharmaceutical industry, such a trial might be referred to as a postmarketing study . Manufacturers' trials may be performed to obtain regulatory approval, or advance the market position of the drug or device in question . Such trials are subject to the same ethical guidelines and constraints as other trials . Clinical research groups' trials . The UK Department of Health has established a National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) to encourage clinical trial activity . This mirrors numerous national and regional efforts to accrue patients rapidly and advance clinical science . These clinical research groups are academically based, and closely linked to governmental research agencies . The compounds and strategies being tested come from laboratory research involving both public and private sectors . Patient safety is of primary concern in a trial . The trial designer must give very careful thought to all the outcomes in a trial and to the early estimators used . It is our view that the referring physician, consultant and patient must understand these stopping rules, at least in outline . Historical control studies, retrospective studies, observational studies and 'audits' and pilot 'trials' are a poor substitute to test any new intervention and have been repeatedly shown to give contrary results to those obtained when tested properly in a randomized trial . Unfortunately, many convince themselves otherwise . Future of the trials process . The trials process will thus gain even greater importance in the advance of medicine . Trials will involve large numbers of 'worried well', and will require long follow-up and expanded scrutiny for unintended adverse effects . Another consequence is that target groups will be smaller, so trials will become less centralized, raising questions about quality control and adequate surveillance . ",The well-conducted clinical trial remains the benchmark of both therapy and medical progress. The patient must be an informed and willing participant in the study. Patient safety is of primary concern in a trial. The clinical trial process needs to be encouraged within routine clinical practice.
9781910797495,chp2,"The initial evaluation of a patient's pain forms the foundation for a rational treatment plan and so it must be as thorough as possible . For patients with chronic pain, this evaluation should include . a general medical history, including a detailed pain history . a psychosocial assessment . For the busy clinician, a handy mnemonic for assessing the patient's pain history and pattern is PQRSTU (Table 2.1) . Many patients with pain due to cancer (see Table 9.1) or other serious illnesses such as HIV/AIDS experience pain from multiple mechanisms, locations and etiologies . Because of the multiple and evolving etiologies of pain, each time a clinician assesses any patient at risk of undertreated pain there must be a fresh evaluation of the pain . Even after an initial pain treatment plan is put in place, the source and severity of a person's pain and the effectiveness of treatment may fluctuate, and therefore their pain should be reviewed and documented at regular intervals . The patient is a key partner in this . When taking the patient's pain history, aspects that should be obtained and recorded in detail include: location, duration, type and intensity of the pain; exacerbating or alleviating factors; previous treatments and response to them; and the meaning of the pain to the patient and their family (Table 2.2) . To avoid underestimating pain in individuals with poor cognition or incapable of communicating, indirect indices of pain such as facial expression or body language become more important . Pain location . It is helpful to ask patients to identify on a body map the areas where they experience pain (Figure 2.1) . Body pain maps may help classify pain, as in the case of peripheral neuropathic pain with different causes (see Chapter 6) . Pain radiation . Identification of pain radiation, where present, may be of assistance in evaluating the possible source of pain (exempli gratia pain from a compressed spinal nerve may radiate down the leg to the foot or down the arm to the hand) . Pain intensity is the most frequently evaluated dimension of pain . During the titration of analgesics for acute time-limited pain of obvious cause (exempli gratia dental extraction), it may suffice to monitor only pain intensity and forego tracking of other aspects of the multidimensional pain experience . Five types of assessment tool have been commonly used to quantify pain intensity (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) . Patients place a mark on the line at a point that best represents their pain . The numeric rating scale (NRS) may be presented graphically or verbally, with 0 representing 'no pain' and 10 representing 'the worst possible pain' . Patients volunteer a number that best represents their pain intensity . The pain, enjoyment and general activity (PEG) scale, a three-question tool that assesses pain intensity, mood and effects on function, has been validated for use in primary care (see Figure 2.2) . Clinicians often anchor the numeric scale numbers with adjectives denoting levels of both pain intensity and function, giving the numbers consensual meaning between patient and clinician . Patient's perception . We now know that the decrement in pain intensity experienced by an individual relates to that patient's baseline (pretreatment) pain intensity . The more severe the baseline pain, the greater the decrement in VAS or NRS score needed to achieve clinical importance for the patient . The neurological examination should evaluate . cranial nerve function . In the case of depressed mood, the clinician should enquire about suicidal ideation, because of the increased risk associated with chronic pain . Cranial nerve function . Psychosocial assessment . The psychosocial assessment should explore the patient's . expectations regarding pain management . Scales such as the Brief Pain Inventory, which evaluates pain intensity and the effect of pain on mood, sleep, social function and activities, are commonly used to monitor the effects of treatment from visit to visit . Quality-of-life questionnaires specifically designed for patients with chronic non-malignant pain have been developed in an effort to better gauge how pain and pain treatments affect HRQoL . The TOPS is validated in cancer and various chronic pain populations . Assessment for risk of substance abuse . However, there is no 1:1 relationship between imaging findings and pain . Indeed, severe degenerative changes may be present with no accompanying pain and vice versa . ","A thorough evaluation of pain history and a detailed examination are the foundations for a rational treatment plan. Persistent pain is a disease entity per se that can undermine many dimensions of health-related quality of life. The patient's pain history should document the onset, location, radiation, duration, type (character) and intensity of pain, exacerbating or alleviating factors, previous treatments and response to them, and the meaning of the pain to the patient and their family. Assessment of patients with chronic pain should include a physical examination with particular attention to neurological and musculoskeletal function, a psychosocial assessment and, when appropriate, diagnostic testing such as imaging. Particular attention must be paid to risks for addiction and/or overdose before prescribing, and during a course of, opioid analgesics."
9781910797426,ch10,"Genetic predisposition plays a strong part in the clinical manifestation of three types of chronic pancreatitis . hereditary pancreatitis . idiopathic pancreatitis . alcohol-related pancreatitis . Hereditary pancreatitis . Hereditary pancreatitis represents a rare cause of chronic pancreatitis and is associated mostly with mutations in the protease serine 1 (PRSS1) gene . Patients can have severe episodes of acute recurrent pancreatitis, which lead to chronic pancreatitis with calcifications, and possibly exocrine and endocrine insufficiency . The risk of pancreatic cancer in these patients is higher compared with the general population . Exocrine and endocrine failure develop in a much higher proportion of patients with hereditary pancreatitis than those with either idiopathic or alcoholic pancreatitis, but the time until failure is longer . About 35% of 70-year-old patients are at risk of pancreatic cancer . Idiopathic pancreatitis . Idiopathic pancreatitis occurs in up to 20% of patients with chronic pancreatitis . Alcohol-related pancreatitis . About 70% of chronic pancreatitis cases are associated with chronic excess alcohol consumption, but fewer than 10% of known alcoholics develop chronic pancreatitis . Whereas cumulative alcohol consumption is directly related to the development of liver cirrhosis, this is not the case in chronic alcohol-related pancreatitis, which appears to be associated with a lower threshold of total alcohol consumed . About 10% of patients develop both liver cirrhosis and chronic pancreatitis . The histological and radiological features of these three types of chronic pancreatitis (hereditary, idiopathic and alcohol-related) are indistinguishable . Inherited abnormal genes play a strong part in the clinical manifestation of the three distinct types of pancreatitis . The CFTR protein is not produced in pancreatic acini, so it is not entirely clear how mutations of the CFTR gene also result in pancreatitis that is otherwise pathologically indistinguishable from any other type of pancreatitis . Mutations of the chymotrypsin C (caldecrin) gene (CTRC) and the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR) are associated with relatively lower increases in risk for chronic pancreatitis . The diagnosis, as with all other types of chronic pancreatitis, will depend on clinical presentation and a combination of functional and imaging investigations . The distinction between hereditary pancreatitis and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis requires a careful family history (Figure 10.2) . For a diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis, there should be at least two first-degree relatives in two or more generations with proven chronic pancreatitis . The detection of a PRSS1 mutation will clinch the diagnosis, but it must be remembered that about 20% of patients do not have a mutation of this gene . It is vital that patients undergo appropriate genetic counseling before any genetic tests are undertaken . Recurrent acute attacks of pain eventually merge into chronic pancreatitis, with continuous pain and ultimately a steady loss of pancreatic function . The median age for presentation for hereditary pancreatitis is around 12 years, but presentation is earlier in children with an R122H mutation (10 years) than in other patients (15 years) . Most patients present by the age of 20 years and 95% by the age of 50 years . In the absence of a family history, the diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis is commonly missed . The median age for presentation for early-onset idiopathic chronic pancreatitis is 20-30 years, 35-45 years for alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis and 60 years for late-onset idiopathic chronic pancreatitis . The treatment of hereditary pancreatitis is at first identical to that of other forms of chronic pancreatitis . Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking are both independent risk factors for chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and should therefore be strongly discouraged . As with other forms of chronic pancreatitis, about 30% of patients will require active intervention by endoscopy and/or surgery because of local pancreatic complications or intractable pain . From the age of 40 years, patients with hereditary pancreatitis should be counseled regarding regular secondary screening for the detection of pancreatic cancer . Routine genetic counseling and gene testing in regional pancreas centers for all families with hereditary and idiopathic pancreatitis . Discovery of additional genes to explain nearly all cases of hereditary pancreatitis . Improved methods of secondary screening to reduce deaths from pancreatic cancer . ","Patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis are likely to carry cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) mutations in one or both alleles of the gene (compound heterozygotes). Children and young adults are often misdiagnosed with other gastrointestinal diseases. There is a lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer (35%), as well as a high risk of diabetes mellitus and exocrine insufficiency. Patients should undergo genetic counseling prior to genetic testing, and from the age of 40 years patients should be offered secondary screening for cancer in a regional pancreas cancer center. Alcohol and tobacco consumption should be strongly discouraged."
9781908541062,ch_7,"IgM RF is present in up to 75% of RA patients during the course of their disease, although it may be absent at presentation . In contrast, its presence may predate the onset of RA by several years (see 2 . Its precise role in the pathogenesis of RA is unclear, but it is associated with more aggressive disease and extra-articular manifestations . RF is not specific for RA, but may accompany other autoimmune diseases, various acute and chronic infections and certain malignancies (Table 6.2) . The serum titer of RF does not generally correlate with disease activity, except in patients with vasculitis (see 5 . iii), who tend to have a high titer . Occasionally, an RF is present in serum that precipitates at low temperatures . This is detectable as a cryoglobulin and may be associated with vasculitis and severe Raynaud's phenomenon . Unlike RF, autoantibodies directed at peptides containing the amino acid citrulline are highly specific for RA (>= 95%) . They may also be present many years before symptomatic onset of RA (see Chapter 2), ultimately appearing in a similar proportion of patients as RF . The identification of the ACPA targets that are most closely associated with RA is an area of active research because this should provide clues to etiology and pathogenesis . The relationship between smoking, the shared epitope and the production of ACPA reflects an important gene-environment interaction in the etiology of RA (see Chapter 2) . ACPA and IgM RF are highly associated with each other, particularly in early RA where over two-thirds of ACPA-positive patients are also positive for IgM RF . As with RF the presence of ACPA, particularly when present at high titer, is associated with more aggressive RA . Other autoantibodies may also be present in patients with RA . Anti-nuclear antibodies are present in approximately 40% of RA patients, usually at low titer, and have minimal diagnostic or prognostic value . A potential association with more aggressive disease or vasculitis requires confirmation . X-rays are often normal in RA at presentation, or may just show soft-tissue swelling and periarticular osteoporosis around affected joints . The rate of development of these changes varies greatly between patients and depends both on therapy and the aggressiveness of the underlying disease . In contrast to conventional X-rays, high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) and MRI may show significant abnormalities in the patient with a very recent onset of joint symptoms . In the patient with early RA, inflamed synovium appears as a high signal on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images, and enhances further with the paramagnetic contrast agent gadolinium-DTPA . Bone marrow edema adjacent to the joint surface is a very early abnormality and appears to presage erosion development . For example, smaller MRI magnets are now available for the study of peripheral joints, providing high-resolution images in an office setting . This can occur as a complication of the RA disease process or secondary to therapy with corticosteroids . In early RA, it is possible to detect small joint effusions and subclinical synovitis . In addition, bone cortical defects are detectable in patients without X-ray erosions . Synovial fluid . Synovial fluid examination is not helpful for the diagnosis of RA . Joint aspiration and microbiological examination is imperative, however, if superadded infection is suspected . This is not uncommon, particularly in the RA patient taking immunosuppressive or biological drugs, and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment . Infection may present as disproportionate inflammation in one or more joints, with or without systemic symptoms, and patients themselves may feel that a distinct process is present in the affected joint . Fluid from acutely inflamed joints secondary to gout or pseudogout may be thick and purulent, whereas fluid from an infected RA joint may appear only slightly cloudy . Monitoring RA . In established RA, investigations are aimed at determining disease activity, documenting damage and monitoring drug therapy . There is no indication to repeat RF titers or ACPA in a seropositive patient, because they do not necessarily correlate with disease activity, but a seronegative patient may convert to seropositivity during the course of their illness . Other radiological investigations should be guided by the clinical picture . The assessment of ongoing RA is discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 . ","In the acute setting the investigation of polyarthritis is guided primarily by the differential diagnosis. There are no pathognomonic tests for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and investigations may be completely normal at presentation. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are highly specific for RA and have a sensitivity of up to 75%. Conventional X-rays may provide diagnostic information but are less sensitive than MRI and high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS), although MRI and HRUS continue to be validated. In the chronic setting, investigations are useful for determining disease activity, monitoring therapy and documenting and monitoring joint damage."
9783318066685,ch3,"Gene therapy emerged in the late 1980s as a potential new molecular medicine that could provide a permanent fix for patients with genetic disease . Since the early 1990s, this task had included human gene therapy trials . Hence, the RAC's mission no longer includes scrutiny of gene therapy trials . Nonetheless, gene therapy is, in some sense, still an experimental therapy that requires close oversight, as data on long-term effects on patients are being collected . Safety concerns in gene therapy are summarized in Table 3.1 and discussed in more detail in the following sections . Therefore, all gene therapy products based on this type of vector are carefully screened for RCR; they have consistently turned out to be negative . However, six patients developed T-cell leukemia between 2.5 and 15 years after the cell transplant . While most patients were successfully treated with chemotherapy, one patient died as a result of the leukemia . Reconstitution with vector-transduced cells was successful in nine of ten patients . However, all nine patients eventually developed myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia, again prompting the design of novel vectors . Gene therapy for beta-thalassemia led to the emergence of a dominant clone with an insertion inside the HMGA2 gene in one patient . Here, vector integration caused transcriptional activation of HMGA2 in erythroid cells . Potential for immune responses . For gene therapy protocols that may require re-administration, immune suppression may have to be employed at the time of the initial vector injection . Innate immune recognition causes infiltration of tissues with immune cells and provides activation signals for subsequent antigen-specific immune responses (B- and T-cell activation) . As a result of more extensive investigation of the innate immune response to adenoviral vectors, their use in gene therapy is now much more limited . In general, there are still concerns even with other vectors when systemic delivery of very high doses is required to achieve therapy . Reducing vector immunogenicity . The risk for such immune responses is influenced by multiple factors, including the type and specific design of the vector, vector dose and route of administration/target tissue . Various strategies have been developed to reduce the immunogenicity of gene transfer vectors . These include the use of tissue-specific promoters to limit expression in professional antigen-presenting cells . MicroRNA targets can be incorporated into transcripts to direct their degradation in antigen-presenting cells . Here, immune tolerance to the therapeutic gene product is more likely to exist in a patient with a missense mutation than in one with a gene deletion . Gene therapy to induce immune tolerance . On the other hand, gene transfer also has the potential to induce immune tolerance . Cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity in CAR-T cell therapy . CAR-T cell therapy may also cause neurotoxicity for reasons that are not entirely clear . Lack of specificity in gene transfer or cell targeting . While targeted vectors with receptor specificity are being developed, most vectors currently used in human gene therapy are not specific to cell type . They are typically chosen because of their tropism to a certain tissue and ability to transfer the gene to the desired cell type within that tissue, but they are typically capable of also infecting other cell types . In some cases, this may be desirable if multiple cell types need to be gene corrected to achieve therapy . In order to restrict transgene expression to the desired cells, tissue-/cell-type-specific promoters are used to achieve specificity at the transcriptional level . The incorporation of microRNA targets adds another layer of post-transcriptional regulation, so that unwanted expression can be eliminated from cell types such as immune cells . Germline gene therapy - a controversial topic . Gene therapy currently focuses on somatic gene transfer . However, especially with the development of gene-editing technologies, germline gene therapy is being discussed as a future possibility . Cost of gene therapies . The cost of those gene therapies that are already approved range from several hundred thousand to more than 2 million dollars, posing a challenge to healthcare systems . However, one also needs to consider the costs of alternative treatments . A gene therapy that lasts at least one decade would therefore substantially reduce treatment costs over time . In life-threatening genetic diseases or cancer, gene therapy may offer a unique possibility for a cure or substantially prolonged life . However, if gene therapies can be adopted in a cost-effective manner, these may become a feasible option in the future . ","Gene therapy is a relatively new type of medicine that is closely monitored and regulated. Some gene therapies have a risk of cancer development (due to insertional mutagenesis), toxicities, unwanted immune reactions or off-target effects. In each case, a risk-benefit analysis provides guidance for patient selection and potential protocol modifications. Continued development of safer gene therapy vectors and protocols mitigates risks and makes gene therapy available to a broader patient population. Although opinions on the ethical implications are diverse, the prevailing view on gene editing is that applications should, at least currently, be restricted to somatic cells because there are still many unknowns about this novel technology. The costs of gene therapy are high, but these therapies could actually provide healthcare systems with savings over time; outcomes-based pricing is one proposed model."
9781910797457,chp9,"As more and more men with prostate cancer survive for longer and longer, 'survivorship' issues are becoming increasingly important . Remember, survivorship years can be some of the best years that patients have . In this respect, those who care for men with prostate cancer can learn a great deal from the teams and charities that treat and support those with breast cancer . Erectile dysfunction . Treatment of localized prostate cancer often results in sexual dysfunction . Erectile dysfunction is the most common complaint and can occur after all treatments . Early administration of pharmaceutical treatments for erectile dysfunction soon after surgery has been shown to improve the time and quality of subsequent erections . Treatment is along the same lines as that for erectile dysfunction following prostatectomy (see also Fast Facts: Erectile Dysfunction) . Patients must be informed about these consequences before surgery . Loss of libido is a common complaint in patients with prostate cancer . Therapy with an antiandrogen can effectively deprive prostate cancer cells of androgen stimulation without such a profound effect on libido or erectile function . Men with prostate cancer, and their partners, should be counseled not only about probable outcomes, but also about the likely effect of the disease and its therapy on sexual activity . Urinary and bowel symptoms . Incontinence following radical prostatectomy . The following factors contribute to the early recovery of continence . younger age of the patient . bilateral nerve-sparing surgery . performing pelvic floor exercises before and after surgery . Urinary and bowel symptoms from radiotherapy . Treatment is also initially conservative, and involves changes to lifestyle, identification of the cause and individualized treatment . There is currently little evidence to support the use of complementary therapies . There is a suggestion that intermittent ADT may be associated with less fatigue than continuous ADT but this is not currently supported by strong trial evidence . Hemoglobin levels rise slowly after treatment has ended . Breast symptoms . Men may experience gynecomastia and mastalgia (swollen and painful breasts) while using some forms of ADT . The likelihood varies with treatment; the risk is highest in men taking antiandrogens or estrogens . The loss appears to continue indefinitely while treatment continues, and there is no recovery after therapy ceases . Just under 20% of men surviving at least 5 years after a diagnosis of prostate cancer have a fracture if treated with ADT, compared with about 13% of men who do not receive this therapy; this is equivalent to one additional fracture for every 28 men treated with ADT . Further prospective trials are required to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates in men with prostate cancer who require ADT . Until the results from these trials become available, suggestions for the management of bone effects in men receiving ADT include baseline and yearly measurements of BMD . Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk . The first study to report an increase in cardiovascular risk in men treated with ADT was a retrospective study of 79 196 men in whom an increased risk of coronary disease, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmia was identified . Another large retrospective study also suggested a 20% increase in cardiovascular morbidity with 1 year of ADT . reported that, in men over 65 years, treatment with ADT decreased the time to fatal myocardial infarction compared with men not receiving this therapy . As this area is controversial, it is prudent to critically weigh the risks and benefits of ADT in men with cardiovascular risk factors . It is also important to monitor all the risk factors in all men undergoing ADT, and to treat these risk factors where appropriate . ADT alters lipid profiles, potentially increasing cardiovascular risk . Insulin sensitivity is related to testosterone levels; ADT reduces insulin sensitivity . A number of large studies have reported a 19-49% increase in the risk of developing diabetes in men receiving ADT . Waist circumference increases while on ADT, but increased waist to hip ratio and hypertension have not been consistently reported in trials . A detailed medical examination and history should be taken before ADT is started, with particular focus on cardiovascular risk factors . This will enable proactive management before any condition becomes worse as a consequence of ADT . Patients at risk should be advised to make lifestyle changes before and while using ADT: stop smoking, lose weight if necessary, increase physical activity, eat a healthy diet . ","Men with prostate cancer require emotional support as well as information on probable outcomes and the effects of the disease and its treatment. Sexual dysfunction is a common sequela of prostate cancer treatment. An open and informed discussion with the patient and his partner will do much to counter anxiety and loss of self-esteem. Erectile dysfunction can often be improved with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, prostaglandin suppositories or injections, or mechanical vacuum devices. Loss of libido can be reduced by using antiandrogens to treat prostate cancer in preference to bilateral orchidectomy or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog/antagonist. Osteoporosis and fractures are side effects of long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): vitamin D status should be evaluated before starting ADT, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as isometric exercises, encouraged during treatment. It is prudent to weigh the risks and benefits of ADT in men with cardiovascular risk factors and to monitor all risk factors during therapy. At-risk patients should be advised to make lifestyle changes as appropriate (exempli gratia stop smoking, lose weight, increase physical activity, improve diet)."
9781908541062,ch_4,"The sublining becomes infiltrated with immune and inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages, B and T lymphocytes, plasma cells and dendritic cells . As the disease progresses, the nature of the synovium changes . Pro-inflammatory cytokines are abundant in the RA synovium . These data suggest that a cytokine imbalance, in favor of pro-inflammatory mediators, may be a key pathogenic mechanism in RA (Figure 3.4) . Despite their central role in RA symptomatology, pro-inflammatory cytokine production is unlikely to be the primary abnormality in RA . For example, cell-to-cell contact between activated T cells and synovial monocytes is a stimulus to TNF production and the rheumatoid synovium is heavily infiltrated with a variety of immune and inflammatory cells . Recently, the importance of different T cell subsets in RA has been revisited . T helper (TH)17 cells, physiologically important in the fight against extracellular bacterial infections, appear pivotal in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as RA . Another important T cell subset is the FoxP3-transcription-factor-positive regulatory subset . Individuals congenitally lacking these cells suffer catastrophic autoimmunity and a number of studies have demonstrated qualitative and/or quantitative abnormalities in RA . There is less evidence for prominent involvement of the more traditional TH1 and TH2 cell subsets in RA pathogenesis . The role of B cells in rheumatoid synovitis has been revisited in recent years . In addition to producing autoantibodies, B cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (including TNF and IL-6), and are also efficient antigen-presenting cells . i) are produced locally in rheumatoid synovium, within the lymphoid follicles, and B cell depletion is now an established and effective therapy for RA (see Chapter 9) . Macrophages are almost certainly the major 'factory' for pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA, and recently there has been renewed interest in the potential role of mast cells in the disease . Homing of cells to synovium . Further progress of inflammatory cells into the joint is stimulated by chemokines, of which there is an abundance in the rheumatoid synovium . These low-molecular-weight peptides provide activating and chemotactic stimuli for inflammatory cells (Figure 3.5) . Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been a well-recognized complication of RA for decades and accounts for at least 50% of the excess mortality seen in RA patients . Therefore, whether enhanced atherosclerosis is purely secondary to RA manifestations or intrinsically linked to its pathogenesis awaits further study . However, cardiovascular complications can occur in early RA, before downstream sequelae such as joint damage . Physiological tissue hyperplasia and lymphocyte proliferation during immune responses are normally counteracted by programmed cell death, or apoptosis, preventing an overaccumulation of cells . Cartilage and bone destruction . Bone destruction in RA is mediated by osteoclasts, which differentiate from monocyte precursors . This may partly underlie bone edema present in early RA, which also contributes to periarticular bone loss . Furthermore, bone marrow provides niches for autoantibody-secreting B cells and plasma cells in RA . Extra-articular disease . There they activate macrophages expressing Fcgamma receptors (receptors for IgG), which then produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to further inflammatory cell influx . Models of pathogenesis . The autoimmune model, now strongly supported by the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), views RA as a classic T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, precipitated by autoreactivity against a joint component . A competing theory states that RA is primarily a disease of FLS . These cells are present in pannus and secrete many destructive factors . Recent experiments even suggest a propensity of these cells to migrate via the blood stream, potentially explaining the spread of RA to new joint areas . Thus, an intrinsic defect of these cells could explain many of the pathological features of RA, with chronic inflammation as a secondary phenomenon . Many of the characteristics of the RA FLS could be explained by epigenetic influences of chronic inflammation . Lastly, macrophages are abundant in synovium during the earliest stages of RA . iii) also emphasizes immune dysregulation as the primary event in RA . ","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease initially localized to the joint lining. Dominant features are synovial inflammation, and proliferation and outgrowth of the synovial lining layer, with destruction of articular cartilage and bone. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in RA pathology. The primary pathogenic event may reside within the immune system or in the synovial lining. However, data from genome-wide association studies and preclinical autoantibody development suggest primary immune dysregulation. Accelerated cardiovascular disease in RA may be secondary to inflammation or intrinsic to the disease process. The inter-relationship between the immune system and bone is receiving increasing attention (osteoimmunology)."
9781905832729,ch_7,"The most common pathologies are stones, infection, nephritis and, in men, prostate enlargement (see 5 . Urinary tract malignancy is rarely seen in patients under 40 years of age . Over 50 years, 10-20% of patients with microscopic hematuria will have significant urinary tract pathology . In taking a history it is important to distinguish hematuria from rectal bleeding, and from vaginal bleeding in women . A history of urinary frequency and dysuria would suggest an infectious cause, which is the most common cause of hematuria in young women . Urinary tract calculi may present with pain . Drugs may cause hematuria: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can cause papillary necrosis, while danazol and cyclophosphamide can cause hemorrhagic cystitis . Anticoagulants will not cause hematuria unless the person is over-anticoagulated . Bladder tumors classically present with painless frank hematuria . Hematuria identified by dipstick urinalysis should always be investigated further by urine microscopy . The incidence of hematuria on microscopy varies from 0.2% to 16.1% in population-based studies . Microscopy can also provide further information about the morphology of the red blood cells . Misshapen red blood cells are usually glomerular in origin, whereas normal red blood cells generally come from the lower urinary tract . Red blood cell casts are almost always associated with glomerular disease . Urine culture is vital to exclude infection as a cause of hematuria; hematuria should never be attributed to infection without a positive culture . In the case of urine infection, a specimen should be examined after treatment to exclude continuing hematuria . Urine should be tested for proteinuria, which may be a sign of renal pathology or an extrarenal medical disorder . It is important to note, however, that sensitivity varies from less than 20% to over 90% depending on the tumor grade, sensitivity being lowest for well-differentiated tumors . Ultrasonography of the renal tract is the preferred initial imaging technique for identifying renal parenchymal disease, hydronephrosis and stone fragments . If hydronephrosis is found, the entire renal tract should be investigated . Ultrasonography can be used to detect and characterize renal masses but is unreliable in detecting upper tract urothelial tumors . Plain abdominal radiography is useful to detect calcification due to renal tract stones, which affect about 5% of the population . It has limited sensitivity for the detection of small renal masses and cannot differentiate between solid and cystic masses . CT is more sensitive for detecting small renal masses, and is the investigation of choice for detecting renal tract stones - it is extremely sensitive (94-98%) compared with IVU (52-59%) and ultrasonography (19%) . CT is used to detect and characterize solid renal masses as well as renal and perirenal infections and associated complications . CT is therefore the most efficient investigation in differentiating the causes of hematuria and, if used as the investigation of first choice, would reduce the time taken to diagnose the underlying etiology . The sensitivity of CT with urographic follow through (CT urography) in detecting urothelial lesions compared with IVU is not yet established . 'One-stop' clinics . The main principles of managing hematuria are as follows . Infections should be managed appropriately . Patients with stones or renal tumors should be referred to the appropriate urologist . Patients with significant proteinuria, renal insufficiency, or red blood cell casts or dysmorphic red blood cells on microscopy should be referred to a nephrologist for evaluation of renal parenchymal disease, which may necessitate a percutaneous renal biopsy . Follow-up . Investigation finds no cause for microscopic hematuria in many patients . Such unexplained hematuria presents a management dilemma . Unexplained frank hematuria requires more extensive investigation . Hematuria can originate from anywhere along the urinary tract and may be an indicator of underlying pathology . The prevalence of hematuria on urine dipstick testing in adults is estimated by various sources to be 2-16% . ","Blood in the urine can originate from anywhere along the urinary tract and may indicate underlying pathology. Dipstick testing is sensitive but does not distinguish between physiological and pathological amounts of blood. The most common causes of hematuria are stones, infection, nephritis and prostate enlargement. Malignancy becomes more likely in patients over 50 years of age and who smoke. Some drugs can cause hematuria. The morphology of red blood cells may distinguish between glomerular and lower urinary tract causes. Investigation of hematuria can be in a 'one-stop' clinic with facilities for cytology, ultrasonography and flexible cystoscopy so that diagnosis can be made in one visit. Ultrasonography is useful for identifying renal parenchymal disease and urinary tract obstruction. Radiography will identify stones. CT scanning is highly sensitive for detecting stones, renal masses and infections. Management depends on the underlying cause identified. Unexplained hematuria should be followed up with repeat tests at a later date."
9781912776726,ch1,"Glioblastoma is the most common intrinsic malignant brain tumor in adults . Specifically, it is a type of infiltrating glioma . Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor and most common subtype of glioma . Given the aging populations in most western countries, the incidence of glioblastoma is expected to increase . Glioblastomas are fast growing, and as such have a poor prognosis; indeed, glioblastoma has the worst prognosis of all glioma diagnoses . Many genetic and environmental factors have been studied in relation to glioblastoma, but no key cause has been identified . Likewise, a high socioeconomic status has been associated with glioblastoma diagnosis . Conversely, increased susceptibility to allergies has been shown to have a protective effect against glioblastoma . Molecular studies have identified key genetic mutations associated with glioblastoma (see page 11) . Glioblastomas are malignant intrinsic tumors that are thought to arise from populations of stem/progenitor cells in the brain (Figure 1.2) . Sometimes tumors that appear to be low grade on histology can have the molecular features of high-grade tumors . In the past, these tumors - which underwent biopsy before the histological high-grade features appeared - were misdiagnosed as low-grade tumors (Figure 1.3b) . Classification by genetic mutation . The recognition of genetic mutations has largely superseded the importance of histological appearance in the classification of glioblastomas (see Figure 1.3) . The key mutations and tumor subtypes are described below; Table 1.1 (see page 16) summarizes the molecular subtypes, their mutations, locations and age distributions . Mutations in the IDH gene were identified in 2008 as an early event in glioma development . More than 95% of mutations occur at codon R132 of the IDH1 gene . However, IDH mutations are rarely found in adult intrinsic (primary) glioblastomas or pediatric glioblastomas . Several studies have shown that glioblastomas with an IDH gene mutation are associated with better prognosis than IDH wild-type glioblastomas (id est glioblastomas with normal IDH genes) . IDH wild-type glioblastoma is the most common form of glioblastoma . These tumors can occur in adults of any age, but arise most commonly in individuals of 50-70 years old . Historically, these tumors were diagnosed as astrocytomas . The 2016 WHO classification describes them as IDH wild-type astrocytomas, but they are better described as glioblastoma precursor or early glioblastoma even though this term is not used by the WHO classification . These precursor forms carry the same mutations as glioblastoma and can therefore be considered as early manifestations of these tumors . IDH- mutant glioblastomas are less common, occurring at 5-10% of the frequency of IDH wild-type glioblastomas . The ATRX mutation results in loss of expression in tumor cell nuclei, which can be seen on histological sections (see Table 1.1) . Posterior fossa tumors are exceptionally rare . This deletion distinguishes lower-grade IDH -mutant astrocytomas from IDH -mutant glioblastomas (see Table 1.1) . These occur in low- and high-grade forms; the latter may have similar histological features to glioblastoma . Loss of heterozygosity 1p/19q does not occur in glioblastoma . Histone H3.3 K27M-mutant glioblastoma has recently been recognized as a rare form of glioblastoma characterized by the K27M driver mutation in the histone H3.3 gene . Histone H3.3 G34R/V-mutant glioblastoma is very rare . The H3.3 G34R mutation is biologically distinct from the K27M mutation . BRAF V600E-mutated tumors have a predilection for the temporal lobe . Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation in glioma cells occurs in about 50% of glioblastomas, increasing chemosensitivity . ","Many intrinsic brain tumors can be defined by their driver mutations, some of which are diagnostically and prognostically relevant. For example, the presence of an IDH mutation generally confers a better prognosis than no IDH mutation with chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss (as seen in early forms of glioblastoma or histological classic glioblastoma). IDH -mutant tumors may be astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas. They occur in people aged 30-40 years and are usually located in the frontal lobe. IDH wild-type glioblastomas occur mostly in older people (50-70 years old). They generally have chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss, and in many cases, EGFR amplification and/or TERT promoter mutation. Gliomas in midline structures are highly likely to have a histone H3.3 K27M mutation. MGMT promoter methylation increases chemosensitivity to temozolomide treatment."
9781908541680,ch_8,"Bringing about a change in behavior is an important part of clinical care; the ability to foster such change in patients is fundamental to the skill base of any health professional . Changing patients' habits and attitudes using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is key to long-term obesity management . Classic behavioral interventions for managing obese patients may last months or years, but complex behavioral therapy concepts can be introduced during a normal consultation . For example, if the first thing an individual does when arriving home from a stressful day is to eat two biscuits, basic dietary and nutritional advice is simple: stop eating biscuits . Behavioral therapy produces disappointing results when used alone, but has much more profound effects when used in combination with other modalities . 'Stage of change' theory . Elements of behavioral therapy . Self-monitoring: increasing self-awareness of eating patterns and physical activity behavior, which is an essential precursor for change . Stimulus control: avoiding situations that lead to harmful behavior, and promoting situations that influence healthy activity . emotional feelings or triggers involved . levels of activity . A food and activity diary should clarify eating patterns and behaviors, particularly events that trigger eating, with a view to changing those patterns once they have been identified, for instance by planning ahead . Long-term weight management has been shown to improve when food records are used . Stimulus control . Different stimuli (cues) for eating, only one of which is feeling physically hungry, must first be identified then managed . For example, eating chocolate biscuits on arriving home from work is more likely to be because of stress than hunger; the stimulus control is therefore to remove the biscuit or the stress . External cues include . time (exempli gratia eating because its lunchtime) . the presence of food (exempli gratia eating because food is available, or finishing a plateful because it is rude or wasteful not to [this can be a habit deeply ingrained from childhood]) . social situations (exempli gratia eating cheese with port because everyone else is) . Stimulus control might involve avoiding external cues, for instance taking a different route home that avoids passing the temptation of a fast-food outlet . Avoiding shopping whilst hungry is another example of stimulus control . Internal cues include stress or emotional eating (discussed below) . Learned self-control occurs with prolonged repetition of the external stimulus, without giving in and eating . After enough journeys home without buying food, the conditioned response will be reduced . Problem solving therapy (PST) can be used during a consultation to implement strategies for the management of obesity . PST facilitates the development of a set of skills that enhance a patient's self-efficacy, and high levels of self-efficacy correlate with successful outcomes in obesity management programs . Patients are supported to develop the ability to recognize potential solutions to their problems rather than solutions being suggested by the patient's healthcare practitioner . 'Stress management' is self-explanatory; comfort eating is widely recognized as a reason for overeating . However, evidence for hyperphagia in a stressful environment is conflicting, as for some individuals stress causes loss of appetite . Many people indulge in 'emotional eating': eating at times of stress, pressure or negative emotional state to provide comfort . This amounts to eating without relying on the usual stimulus of hunger to govern when food is required . Such behavior may reflect childhood patterns, even breast-feeding, when eating and comfort were closely associated . Diagnostic criteria are loss of control of eating plus three of . eating much more rapidly than normal . eating until uncomfortably full . eating large amounts when not physically hungry . eating alone because of embarrassment of volume of consumption . The prevalence among patients attending obesity clinics is 20-30%, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the condition without delay . Treatment involves conventional weight management combined with CBT . Strict dietary regimens are likely to aggravate the condition and should be avoided . The prevalence of NES in the general population is 1-2%, rising to 10% of obese patients and as many as a quarter of grossly obese people . Patients with NES lack hunger before their episodes of night eating, display 'automaticity' of the behavior during waking intervals and varying levels of consciousness during eating . Treatment is predominantly behavioral rather than dietary, initially by persuading patients to have an early substantial breakfast and to regain a normal eating pattern . ","Behavioral therapy, alongside diet and lifestyle advice, is one of the three key components of obesity management. A person's degree of motivation and expectations should be assessed. Techniques include goal setting, self-monitoring and stimulus control. Binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome are specific eating disorders and should be treated accordingly."
9781910797457,chp4,"Multiparametric MRI is increasingly used before biopsy to identify suspicious lesions within the prostate that would allow targeted biopsy, and may also mean that biopsy can be avoided in some men with normal MRI findings and lower levels of suspicion . Multiparametric (mp) MRI - which is based on four MRI techniques - is increasingly used to identify 'areas of interest', so that biopsies can be better targeted, and to stage prostate cancer . Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI involves imaging the prostate during rapid infusion of gadolinium contrast . The combination of MRI methods is claimed to significantly improve the detection and local staging of prostate cancer by MRI, and is now widely used before prostate biopsy to target suspicious areas, and to follow up patients managed by active surveillance . Indeed, some are now arguing that prior MRI is a prerequisite to improve the accuracy of biopsy and to avoid false-negative findings . Furthermore, in cases where a biopsy is warranted, a negative finding on MRI can provide reassurance to the patient, id est that they don't have prostate cancer . Furthermore, nine out of 10 men (89%) who had a negative mpMRI scan did not have a cancer, or had a harmless cancer . Prostate biopsy . If the MRI is normal (or is not performed), biopsies of the prostate may be performed systematically, either transrectally or transperineally . In men with suspicious lesions on MRI, targeted biopsies can be performed by cognitive, MRI-ultrasonography fusion or, rarely, in-bore MRI-guided biopsy (see pages 48 -) . Patients should be warned about the risk of post-biopsy sepsis and the need for treatment if it occurs . Cognitive targeted biopsy . If a suspicious lesion is identified on MRI, targeted biopsies are required to sample the area . The most simple, but potentially least accurate, method is cognitive registration, where the MRI is reviewed before the biopsy in order to cognitively target the region of interest on the ultrasound image . In-bore MRI-guided biopsy involves placing the patient in the MRI gantry and performing the biopsy under real-time MRI guidance . While this is the most accurate method of targeting a suspicious lesion on MRI, the technique is cumbersome and is not clinically practicable for most patients . Ultrasound-guided biopsy . Some prostate tumors are hypoechoic, but hypoechoic images may result from other causes, so the specificity of this finding for prostate cancer is only 20-25% . Assessment of local staging by TRUS imaging alone is poor . Staging of localized disease . Accurate grading and staging of prostate cancer, particularly distinguishing between Gleason grades and between localized and more extensive disease, is critical for selection of the optimum treatment . Staging of localized disease relies on the following techniques . PSA measurement . radionuclide bone scan . PET/CT (with PSMA [prostate-specific prostate antigen] ligand or choline) . Digital rectal exam has an accuracy for staging prostate cancer of only 30-50% . Prostate-specific antigen determination . A reasonable correlation between PSA levels and clinical stage (and, to a lesser extent, pathological stage) of prostate cancer is seen within overall groups of patients . However, the correlation is poorer in individual patients because of the considerable overlap between the PSA ranges associated with different stages . A negative scan also serves to reassure a patient that his skeleton is not involved . Multiparametric MRI can be used to stage as well as detect prostate cancer . MRI provides little advantage over CT in the evaluation of nodal metastases . Staging of metastatic disease involves assessing the extent of bone and soft tissue involvement . PET/CT scanning . Prognostic tables and nomograms . The manufacturers maintain that the test can identify low- and intermediate-risk patients and those who are potentially at higher risk of cancer-specific mortality . This test can be used to counsel patients and guide therapeutic options after prostate biopsy and after radical prostatectomy . A genomic prostate score allows more accurate risk stratification of patients with low -and intermediate-risk prostate cancer than is possible with the Gleason grade group alone and informs decisions about treatment . Summary of diagnostic and staging options . An approach to the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer is outlined in Figure 4.6 . ","Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed on the basis of transrectal or transperineal biopsy. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The Gleason score of these biopsies, clinical stage on digital rectal exam (DRE) and presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value provide an estimate of the risk of extraprostatic extension. Multiparametric MRI is increasingly used to target biopsies and can provide information about local staging. Bone scanning identifies bone metastases, although the probability of these in patients with PSA below 10 ng/mL is low. PET/CT is useful to detect soft-tissue and bone metastases."
9783318066241,ch1,"Physiology of normal pancreatic function . The pancreas is an organ with important exocrine and endocrine functions, including being the main source of digestive enzymes . The exocrine pancreas consists of acinar and ductal cells (Figure 1.1) . Pancreatic acinar cells secrete inactive digestive enzymes (zymogens) in order to protect the pancreas from self-digestion . Trypsin is a key pancreatic enzyme and is secreted as a zymogen called trypsinogen . Trypsin then activates other molecules of trypsinogen as well as other zymogens into active enzymes . Pancreatic ductal cells secrete water and bicarbonate, which neutralize gastric acid and help to flush pancreatic enzymes into the duodenum . Endocrine cells (clustered into the islets of Langerhans) are scattered along the exocrine tissue, and hormones such as insulin interact with acinar cells to further regulate exocrine secretion . However, the initial step in the pathogenesis of AP is acinar cell injury, which has several important consequences (Figure 1.3) . Altered calcium signaling . Altered calcium signaling is associated with destabilization of the secretory zymogen granules and intracellular activation of trypsinogen to trypsin . When an injured cell becomes necrotic, it releases substances that activate inflammation, including so-called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) . DAMPs induce local inflammation and may also be associated with systemic inflammation . Acinar cell injury is associated with the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B, which in turn induce the secretion of proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules . These substances are involved in immune cell recruitment to the damaged tissue: neutrophils, monocytes and other cells infiltrate the pancreas and produce inflammation . Proinflammatory cytokines greatly contribute to systemic toxicity . Autophagy blockade appears to be another important step in the pathogenesis of AP . The initial injury to the acinar cells can block this process of autophagy, leading to trypsinogen activation, cell death and inflammation . The exact mechanisms underlying the relationship between autophagy and pancreatitis are subject to ongoing research . Premature intrapancreatic activation of zymogens Altered calcium signaling, inflammation, altered autophagy and genetic mutations in certain proteins (see page 19-22) are associated with intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen to trypsin . In turn, trypsin can activate other zymogens in a cascade reaction that leads to mitochondrial malfunction, cell necrosis and direct self-digestion of the pancreas and its surroundings . AP is a heterogeneous disease . Two-thirds of patients will develop a mild and uneventful disease characterized by pancreatic edema (classically termed edematous pancreatitis) and little or no systemic inflammatory response . However, the remaining one-third of patients will develop local and/or systemic complications . Acute peripancreatic fluid collections contain inflammatory exudates but are rarely complicated by infection . Pancreatic gland necrosis results from massive cellular injury mediated by the mechanisms described above and also from damage to the pancreatic microvasculature caused by inflammation . Peripancreatic fat necrosis arises when the fat surrounding the pancreas is affected by inflammation and digestion by pancreatic lipase . These local complications are frequently associated with pain, systemic inflammation, fluid sequestration and sometimes with compression of neighboring structures, leading to intolerance of an oral diet, thrombosis of peripancreatic veins, jaundice or infection . Infection is the consequence of early bacterial translocation due to a loss of the barrier function of the bowel: bacteria reach regional lymph nodes, the splanchnic vein system and then the necrotic tissue . Necrotizing pancreatitis (pancreatic gland and/or peripancreatic fat necrosis) is also associated with a higher risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome leading to organ failure due to uncontrolled and unbalanced release of proinflammatory mediators . Up to 50% of patients who develop persistent (> 48 hours in duration) shock, kidney failure and/or respiratory failure will die . Complications are discussed in detail in Chapter 5 . ","The pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is incompletely understood. Initial acinar cell injury has several cellular consequences that promote local inflammation. Severe local damage is associated with a systemic inflammatory response, which, when uncontrolled, may progress to organ failure. AP may induce bacterial translocation. Viable bacteria in the bloodstream may colonize necrotic pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissue resulting in infection."

However, the prognosis for patients with metastases has improved and about 20% of patients will be alive 5 years from diagnosis . It is important to have a clear view of the aim of treatment . Patient outcomes . In an individual patient, the best predictor of outcome is previous response . Systemic treatment can improve symptoms in 30-70% of patients and may delay disease progression . With newer combination regimens, particularly those given in combination with targeted therapy, there may be an opportunity to improve overall survival .

Many cytotoxic drugs have activity in breast cancer . The choice of drug(s) will depend on previous adjuvant treatment, performance status, organ function and patient preference (Figure 8.1) . Combination regimens are more commonly used in the USA than in Europe, especially for the first-line treatment of metastatic disease . Targeted therapy . HER2-targeted therapy . The chemotherapy is usually for a fixed number of courses, but trastuzumab is continued until disease progression . The use of trastuzumab has led to control of systemic disease and the emergence of brain metastases . It has been approved for use as first-line therapy in metastatic breast cancer in combination with weekly paclitaxel for patients with HER2 negative breast cancer . The optimal duration of treatment (fixed course or until disease progression) is uncertain . Triple-negative breast cancer . Management of disease at individual sites . Locally advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer should be staged to exclude metastatic disease and then managed with systemic treatment, the choice of which will depend on a number of patient and tumor factors, including receptor status . Surgery may be possible after systemic treatment . Locoregional radiotherapy is recommended for all patients . Even if patients have small-volume metastatic disease, local treatment of the breast is important to prevent problems associated with uncontrolled local disease . Inflammatory breast cancer accounts for 1-2% of all breast cancers . Bone metastases occur in over 70% of patients with metastatic breast cancer and may be solitary or multiple . Management is predominantly dependent on systemic treatment; however, there is interest in local treatment with radiofrequency or ultrasound ablation if only a few liver metastases are present . Resection may be considered for solitary metastases or disease confined to one lobe of the liver; however, only 10% of patients have disease confined to the liver .

9781908541703,ch_5,"Lumps resulting from breast cancer are generally single, hard and painless, and may be irregular in shape . Approximately 60% arise in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, but any area of the breast can be affected . Pain in the breast is seldom due to cancer . However, pain does not exclude a cancer . The likelihood of cancer is increased if a lump is found on examination . Changes in size or shape of the breasts may also indicate breast cancer . The affected breast may increase in size or become pendulous; conversely, in advanced breast cancer the breast may shrink owing to loss of normal breast tissue and retraction because of cicatrization . The veins in the breast may become more prominent as the tumor enlarges . This is a late sign of cancer (stage T4) . A few women find the axillary lump first and can feel the breast lump only after the doctor shows it to them . women with minor or moderate breast pain that is not localized to one place and who do not have a palpable lesion . A standard 'breast history' includes . the family history of breast and ovarian cancer . Clinical examination is an essential first step in the diagnosis of breast cancer . Both mammography and ultrasonography have important roles in the diagnosis of breast cancer . MRI is also useful, particularly when the breasts are dense . to increase the likelihood of detecting a relatively small cancer in patients whose breasts have a coarse nodular texture . to reveal, in women with a palpable lump, a non-palpable lump in the same or opposite breast; it should therefore be a prerequisite before conservative breast surgery . for regular monitoring of women who have undergone mastectomy for breast cancer because of increased risk of developing cancer in the remaining breast . It should be remembered that mammography is particularly insensitive when the breasts are radiographically dense . Ultrasonography has now become part of the standard evaluation of clinical abnormalities in the breast . Magnetic resonance imaging . MRI may aid the diagnosis and management of breast cancer in certain clinical situations (Table 4.3) . Histological examination of the sample can then be used to confirm the cancer diagnosis . It is increasingly being used, especially for lesions detected by screening . The aim of screening is to reduce mortality by detecting tumors before they have spread beyond the breast . Since over 90% of breast cancers are first detected by the woman herself, the rationale for regular self-examination is to increase the likelihood of detecting a tumor as early as possible . Screening by regular mammography can reduce the risk of mortality from breast cancer by 20-30% in certain groups . Significant benefits are, however, seen only in women over the age of 50 years . There is, therefore, no evidence to support regular screening in women under 50 years of age . Screening programs for breast cancer are associated with a number of problems . Only about 70-80% of women accept mammography . Of all the cancers diagnosed, over 50% are diagnosed between screening mammograms . For every breast cancer detected, a substantial number of women will undergo biopsies or surgery for benign breast disease, with attendant morbidity . This risk is, however, low . Small breast cancers detected by mammography may be biologically different from those detected clinically . If these cancers are treated in the same way as invasive cancers, some women may undergo unnecessarily extensive surgery . Many invasive cancers detected by screening would never have progressed to clinical disease . For every 2000 women screened for 10 years, 43 (vs 33 if not screened) cancers would be diagnosed . The issue of risk and its importance when discussing screening with women is discussed in Chapter 2 . It brings with it the infrastructure and quality assurance mechanisms that improve the treatment of all breast cancers and therefore benefits all women - those with symptomatic and screen-detected cancers . Breast self-examination . In the latter part of the 20th century, several large-scale programs were established to teach self-examination techniques and encourage women to examine their breasts each month . Indeed, two large-scale randomized controlled trials performed in St Petersburg and China found no difference in breast cancer mortality rates between women trained in breast self-examination and a control group . In the UK, emphasis was cleverly switched to 'breast awareness' rather than regular self-examination . However, it should be remembered that breast awareness has no proven value . ","A logical process for assessing breast pain or masses will greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy. Triple assessment - clinical examination plus imaging plus cytological or histopathological examination - represents the diagnostic gold standard. All suspicious findings on MRI require pathological confirmation. No test is pathognomonic. Clinical judgment has high value. Breast screening programs have modest utility. Their greatest value may be in increasing patient self-awareness and in the improved organization of clinical services. Breast self-examination can no longer be recommended, though women should be aware of normal physiological changes and thus be alerted to the first chance observation of a pathological change."

While cigarette smoking, itself now regarded as a disease, is the major risk factor, COPD also occurs in non-smokers and individuals vary greatly in their susceptibility to smoke . Cigarette smoking is the most important etiologic factor for the development of COPD . There is, however, considerable individual variation . Some non-smokers, for example, have impaired lung function . Approximately 20% of patients with COPD are lifelong non-smokers . It is likely that smoking contributes to the development of COPD in several distinct ways and at several different periods over the lifespan of the individual (Table 2.1) . Exposure to other substances, including indoor and outdoor pollution, can also contribute to the development of COPD . Passive exposure to cigarette smoke is an important risk factor and may contribute to the development of COPD in non-smokers . Individuals exposed to dusts and fumes who also smoke cigarettes have the highest risk of developing COPD . Consistent with this, smokers show considerable heterogeneity in their susceptibility to developing COPD and strong genetic components appear to be present . Both smoking and non-smoking siblings of individuals with established COPD are at greatly increased risk of lower lung function than are siblings of individuals without COPD . It is likely that a number of specific genetic factors will affect susceptibility to COPD (see pages 27 -) . Such occupational exposures contribute to 10-20% of the symptom or functional impairment in COPD . Low maximal attained lung function increases the risk of excessive loss of lung function in later life . Not surprisingly, a variety of early life events can increase the risk for the development of COPD, presumably by affecting lung growth and development . Interestingly, these infections may affect lung function in several ways . Whether alterations in the lung microbiome play a role in COPD pathogenesis is currently under investigation . Low socioeconomic status is also a risk factor for the development of COPD and may reflect the association with risk factors such as smoking, occupational exposures and respiratory infections . Airway hyperreactivity is also a risk factor for the development of COPD . The fact that asthma is characterized by increased airway reactivity and individuals with increased reactivity have a greater risk of developing COPD suggests a link between asthma and COPD . Chronic bronchitis or mucus hypersecretion is associated with increased FEV decline; younger adult smokers with chronic bronchitis have an increased risk of COPD . Genetic factors . There is a significant familial risk of airflow limitation in smoking siblings of patients with severe COPD, suggesting that genetic factors influence the development of the condition (Table 2.2) . The most widely recognized genetic association with COPD is alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency (alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency) . People deficient in alpha1-proteinase inhibitor are at increased risk of developing COPD even if they do not smoke, although not all affected individuals develop disease . If such individuals smoke, they are much more likely to develop severe COPD and to develop it at a particularly early age (Figure 2.3) . However, only some non-smokers with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency develop emphysema . This indicates the importance of other factors . Additional genetic associations that may contribute to COPD risk and that are more common than alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency have been identified, although these are likely to increase the risk of COPD only modestly . Inhibition of tissue repair may contribute to the development of COPD alongside the mechanisms that augment tissue destruction . Starvation, for example, has been reported to cause COPD both in humans and in animals . Many individuals with seemingly stable COPD often deteriorate if they develop a severe and prolonged intercurrent illness . Thus, one of the benefits of careful attention to nutritional balance in such patients might be mitigation of the acceleration of COPD . Progression of clinical symptoms . Current understanding of the natural history of COPD depends on assessment of FEV . This heterogeneity in FEV decline highlights the importance of assessing other clinical disease parameters in COPD independent of FEV . Many people who are developing COPD control dyspnea on exertion by decreasing their level of effort . ","Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for COPD; about 80% of patients with COPD are, or have been, smokers. Almost all smokers develop impaired lung function. Other influences, including air pollution and occupational exposures, contribute to COPD risk. Individual genetic susceptibility probably accounts for the heterogeneity of COPD risk. It is likely that many specific genetic factors will contribute to COPD risk; alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency is the best characterized of these. Asthma may contribute to COPD risk in some individuals. Early life events, including compromised lung development and growth, are likely to contribute to the risk of developing COPD later. Many individuals with COPD are undiagnosed, as symptoms of dyspnea can be minimized by restricting activity, which leads patients to discount their functional compromise."
9781910797082,ch02,"Chronic plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) accounts for approximately 85% of all cases of psoriasis . Most patients develop clinical signs of psoriasis before the age of 35 years and about 10% of patients develop the condition during childhood . There is no specific blood test for psoriasis . Clinical manifestations . Shape of lesions . Associated ankle edema is common . Recent studies have indicated that pustular forms of psoriasis may be genetically distinct from chronic plaque psoriasis . Regions commonly involved include the thicker areas of the skin, such as the scalp, elbows, knees, sacral area and knuckles on the hand dorsa . Color of lesions . Sites of disease involvement . Secondary candidiasis in body folds can also modify psoriasis, as can concurrent disease such as HIV infection, which frequently results in a more inflammatory form of psoriasis, often with severe facial involvement . The patient's habitual scratching will often modify the psoriasis to produce asymmetrical plaques, particularly on the sides and the posterior scalp . Involvement of the face is not uncommon . In addition, men frequently develop psoriasis within the beard region, particularly the sides of the neck due to shaving trauma . Involvement of the umbilicus and natal cleft is common . Two main forms of psoriasis occur on the hands and feet . The palmar surface (Figure 2.10) and sides of the fingers are frequently involved . Genitalia are frequently involved (Figure 2.11) . The pubic region is often involved in both sexes . Direct extension of disease from the natal cleft may involve perianal skin and cause pruritus ani . Involvement of the nails can take several forms, as described below . Patients with significant nail disease have a higher propensity for developing psoriatic arthritis . Comorbidities in psoriasis . It is becoming increasingly clear that a multitude of diseases is associated with psoriasis . This observation has strong clinical implications and suggests that the management of patients with psoriasis should take into account factors other than the severity of the skin disease . Psoriatic joint disease . Patients with the most common form - distal interphalangeal joint disease - frequently have concomitant nail disease, localized to the same digits as the joint disease . Other organ-specific autoimmune diseases . The association between psoriasis and Crohn's disease is recognized both clinically and genetically . The association between psoriasis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and uveitis is also recognized . Cancer has been a key issue in psoriasis and its management for some time . What has not been clear is whether psoriasis itself is a risk factor for malignancy or whether the excess risk of various cancers in patients with psoriasis is a result of its treatment . Two cancers are associated with psoriasis: lymphoma and skin cancer, predominantly non-melanoma skin cancer . Both these cancers are more common in patients with moderate and severe disease than in those with mild disease . Lymphoma is approximately twice as common in the psoriasis population compared with the general population . Patients on systemic and biological therapies should be monitored twice a year for evidence of new skin cancers . Metabolic syndrome describes a number of clinical features that together largely explain the excess risk of cardiovascular and liver disease in patients with psoriasis . Furthermore, the individual components of the metabolic syndrome are known to be overrepresented in patients with psoriasis . Recent studies show that obesity is much more common in patients with psoriasis, particularly if they have severe disease . Studies in young adults have also shown that as weight increases so does the prevalence of psoriasis . Cardiovascular disease . Over the past decade there has been increasing realization of a definitive link between psoriasis and cardiovascular disease . Epidemiological studies indicate that cardiovascular disease is more common in patients with psoriasis, and traditional risk factors such as hypertension and obesity also have an increased incidence in these patients (see above) . Furthermore, mortality from cardiovascular disease is 2.6-fold greater in patients with moderate and severe psoriasis than in the general population . The adverse effect of psoriasis on quality of life has been well documented and is regarded as an important indication for treating patients with the disease . ","Psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis; there is no blood test specific for this disease. Chronic discoid plaque psoriasis is the most common subtype of psoriasis. The scalp, elbows, knees and sacrum are the areas most commonly affected by psoriasis. Psoriasis can sometimes be triggered by infection, trauma, stress or medications. Psoriasis is associated with a number of comorbidities that have important health and socioeconomic implications."
9781910797693,chp6,"Trial endpoints . Biosimilar oncologics face a challenge of confidence given that the aim of curative treatment is the absence of disease . For originator drugs, the pivotal trial endpoints were disease-free survival and overall survival rates 5 years after treatment . The regulatory's aim for a biosimilar is to show no clinically meaningful difference in efficacy, as determined by the totality of evidence from structural analytics and functional assays of biopotency, and phase I and III trials to show comparable safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints . Critically, the PD endpoints for biosimilars are usually surrogate rather than clinical results . For rituximab biosimilars, some manufacturers have submitted trial data mainly from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, with only small confirmatory trials in lymphoma . Whilst regulators are familiar with the issues of extrapolating data between diseases, surveys show that this is the principle barrier to clinician confidence in the use of rituximab biologics . Trial settings . In the case of trastuzumab biosimilars for breast cancer, manufacturers have, as for rituximab, chosen different clinical settings in which to demonstrate equivalence based on phase III PD endpoints . Celltrion performed phase III PD trials in both settings . Whilst all these trial designs can provide the PD and safety data to show comparability, as required by regulators, it is potentially confusing for clinicians, who are used to comparing data for identical endpoints for competing treatment options . Biosimilars of bevacizumab (Avastin ®) have yet to be launched in Europe or the USA; however, insight into the approaches of the developer and regulator can be seen from data reviewed by the ODAC in July 2017 . Regulators accept that such a difference is unlikely to create any clinically meaningful difference in safety or efficacy . Such differences in glycan composition can result in different immune profiles, which could be critical to interchangeability . However, bevacizumab has low immunogenicity, and an immune response is even less likely to be associated with its use in patients receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy for cancer . Equivalence for bevacizumab-ABP215 was shown clinically in a phase III trial involving 578 patients: treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies were found in 2.5% of patients treated with the reference drug, bevacizuamb, and 1.4% of those who received bevacizumab-ABP215 . Such issues cannot be assessed by the drug regulators as use in wet-AMD is unlicensed . Problems such as this have previously been resolved by large-scale clinical studies, which will probably be required in this context, before ABP215 can be used in this unlicensed setting . Confusion, stemming from differences in trial design, is compounded by the desire of competing manufacturers to create differentiation between biosimilars of the same drug . With the originator cancer drugs, claims of superiority were based on differences in trial outcomes, such as a longer time without tumor or disease progression, higher 5-year overall survival rates, or lower drug toxicity . Since phase III clinial trials for biosimilars are tailored for each drug, and trial endpoints may be different from the originator pivotal study, it may be impossible to directly compare a biosimilar with the originator, or indeed, other biosimilars . Formulary decisions about the choice of biosimilar would then be driven by price and convenience, as is the case for generic drugs . This offers little opportunity to claim technical superiority of one biosimilar over another, as all versions of a drug will have been determined comparable . Only in the USA is there potential for brand differentiation between biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars (see page 31), although this is not expected until after 2019, long after this class of drugs will have been launched . Different clinical trial designs therefore offer an opportunity for drug manufacturers to make claims of superiority of one trial approach over another that are of no interest to the regulator . The regulator requires only that equivalence has been shown in a suitably sensitive PD endpoint . The problem, suggests Professor Pekka Kurki of the Finnish Medicines Agency, is that while regulators decide what constitutes a biosimilar based on analytical and non-clinical testing, as well as clinical trial data (the totality of evidence), clinicians consider only clinical testing . ","The next wave of biosimilars will be therapeutic oncology drugs, such as rituximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, and recombinant insulins. The equivalence of oncology biosimilars will be based on surrogate pharmacodynamic endpoints, rather than survival, and extrapolation from non-oncology indications, with regulators considering the totality of evidence. Marketing pressure to differentiate between medicines is usually based on clinical differences in phase III trials. However, biosimilars do not fit this commercial model, as by definition, they offer no difference in efficacy or safety with which to differentiate brands."
9781912776238,ch4,"Timing of biosimilar development . Original reference medicines are protected at launch by patent law and laws on data exclusivity that prevent potential generic and biosimilar drug developers from relying on the originator's test data submitted for marketing approval when seeking such approval for its own product . The manufacturers of original reference drugs are frequently accused of 'evergreening' to delay competition - maintaining data exclusivity through the introduction of minor changes to a product, such as a change to the dosing schedule from twice to once a day, which can potentially extend monopolies for years . This has particularly affected biosimilar development in the USA, where originators have tried to protect monopoly status well beyond the patent expiry of the drug itself through the creation of a 'patent thicket' of often dozens of secondary legal blocks to competitors . The first appearance of such tactics in biosimilar development was in 2015, when an originator biologic manufacturer described publicly its strategy: it listed 22 patents for various diseases or methods of treatment, 14 on the drug's formulation, 24 on its manufacturing practices and 15 other patents . The impact was to prolong US monopoly patent protection up to 2034 - while biosimilar versions of the same drug were approved and marketed in Europe by 2018 . Biosimilar manufacturers have reacted in two ways: some companies have agreed with the reference drug maker to extend US patent protection until 2023, while one company is launching a legal attack on this policy . Third parties have become involved; a trade union has launched a case against both the reference drug maker and those who have settled to delay the launch of competition, while Senators on the Finance and Judiciary Committees look to change the controlling legislation . 3 Who wins this legal debate will affect dramatically US biosimilars policy over the next few years . Development in the USA . Patent law is not the only difference affecting biosimilar development in Europe and the USA . In America, the first copies of biological reference drugs were approved through the abbreviated new drug application pathway as generics - human growth hormone Omnitrope (Sandoz) in 2006 and Enoxaparin-M-Enoxaparin (Momenta/Sandoz) in 2010 . Without the regulatory description of 'biosimilar', the US versions of these drugs did not attract the negative position statements of clinician associations that were seen in Europe, nor was there a required understanding of this process at the time . Further biosimilar approvals then stalled until new legislation was passed to create a separate biosimilars approval pathway under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) defined a biosimilar as a biological product highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components; and with no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product . However, it also stipulated extending data exclusivity for original reference drugs to 12 years and creating controversial disclosure requirements on biosimilar makers . The scientific steps to approval in the USA are directly analogous to those in Europe . However, the US regulator in 2010 signaled an intention to further designate some biosimilars 'interchangeable biosimilars'; this subclass has regulatory approval for potential brand substitution by dispensing pharmacists . For a biosimilar to be designated as interchangeable, proof is required that it will have the same expected clinical results in any given individual patient . Furthermore, if the medicine is administered more than once, the 'interchangeable' product should demonstrate comparable safety and efficacy when switching between the biosimilar and the reference product . Within the USA, there can be state laws that govern how a medicine can be used . For biosimilars, this is principally ruling on the substitution of brands by pharmacists . Similar rulings were placed in the era when generic medicines were being introduced, and one of the key historic roles of pharmaceutical benefit schemes in the USA was to overturn many local state restrictions to create today's competitive American medicines market . Development in Europe . Europe has a specific legal problem, with one central regulator shared between 31 nations . Biosimilars are approved by the supranational European Medicines Agency, while patent laws can be national . As dates of patent filing may differ across the 31 nations, dates of expiry will differ as well . This explains the European need for 'bioidentical' drug brands for different nations - identical medicines sold under different brand names with different approved indications (some examples are listed in Table 4.1) . No such need for bioidentical medicines is required in the USA as one patent office and one regulator covers the same territory . ","'Evergreening' is a process by which manufacturers of originator products introduce minor changes to protect their drug development data from being made available to other companies. US state laws govern drug substitutions by the pharmacist. In Europe, national patent laws may mean that one biosimilar, approved by the European Medicines Agency, is available with different names in different European countries - these are bioidenticals."

Many types of leukemia, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), show no specific symptoms in the early stages and may be diagnosed incidentally during a physical examination or routine blood test. Both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can present with signs and symptoms of bone marrow failure, including those related to anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The presence of blasts in a peripheral blood smear suggests an underlying hematologic disorder. Myeloblasts containing Auer rods are pathognomonic for AML. Examination of bone marrow aspirate can confirm the diagnosis of leukemia. Flow cytometry can differentiate between ALL and AML on the basis of different cell surface markers. On immunophenotypic analysis, the presence of B-cell antigens in the absence of T-cell antigens differentiates B-cell ALL from T-cell ALL. CML is diagnosed by the presence of the chromosome translocation t(9;22), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The t(9;22) mutation also occurs in some cases of ALL. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with favorable responses to treatment, while others are associated with treatment failure. Detection of recurring gene mutations in AML and ALL provides important genetic information about prognosis and informs the selection of targeted therapies."

9781910797082,ch01,"Psoriasis is a common chronic, disfiguring inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 3% of the population . Several clinical variants exist (see Chapter 2) of which chronic plaque psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) is the most common form (85-90% of all cases) . However, psoriasis can occur at any age, including childhood (often signifying a more severe clinical course) and old age . Types of psoriasis . Two types of chronic plaque psoriasis have been described, based on age of onset, association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and disease course . Affected individuals tend to have more severe disease that runs a more irregular course . In these individuals, a positive family history is very uncommon and the disease tends to be mild and localized . Psoriasis severely affects a patient's quality of life in terms of both psychological and physical well-being . Studies comparing psoriasis with other important chronic diseases have shown that the impact of psoriasis on the patient's quality of life is at least as great as that of ischemic heart disease, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Psoriasis is therefore a disease of major socioeconomic importance; in the USA alone, the annual cost to society has been estimated at US$3.5 billion . Furthermore, there is increasing evidence of an association between psoriasis and important comorbidities including cardiovascular and psychiatric disease; evidence suggests that patients with moderate and severe disease have a high mortality due to cardiovascular events (see Chapter 2) . In the UK, although most patients with psoriasis have relatively mild disease, evidence suggests that 30% require second-line treatment (phototherapy or systemic medication) that involves referral to a dermatologist and that perhaps 40% of all dermatology inpatients have psoriasis . The advent of new treatments has greatly improved the outlook for many patients, particularly those with severe disease . The pathogenesis of psoriasis can be described in terms of three inter-related phases (Figure 1.1) . the interplay between environmental and genetic factors . the interaction between innate/adaptive immunity and key inflammatory and epidermal cells . The validity of this statement has been borne out by population and family studies and research in twins, all of which suggest an important genetic component to the disease . For example, in terms of types I and II psoriasis (see page 7), approximately 80% of patients with type I psoriasis are positive for the HLA-Cw6 gene, compared with only 20% of those with type II psoriasis . Approximately 30% of patients with psoriasis will have a known family history of the disease . In some families, psoriasis appears to behave like a Mendelian autosomal dominant disease, whereas in other cases there is little or no family history . It has been suggested that psoriasis may represent a spectrum of diseases in which different genes, working either alone or in concert (polygenic disease), are important in different families . To date, approximately 35 genetic loci have been associated with psoriasis . Furthermore, when combined with immunologic studies, they define the key T-cell subset in psoriasis pathogenesis as T helper (Th)-17 cells (see below) . Excessive alcohol intake is also associated with disease deterioration and makes management more difficult . Immunologic changes . Evidence that psoriasis is primarily an immunologic disease comes from many different sources . Experimentally, psoriasis can be induced in non-lesional skin transplanted onto mice by injection of lymphocytes from the same patient . Considerable progress has been made in identifying the precise lymphocytes that cause the disease (see Genetics above) . There has been an explosion of knowledge about immunopathogenetic events in psoriasis . These findings are fundamental to our understanding of psoriasis . Psoriasis represents an important and key disease in which translational medicine has led to major clinical advances . Changes in the epidermis and dermis . Psoriasis is characterized by bright red, elevated, scaly plaques . accumulation of inflammatory cells . Accumulation of inflammatory cells . Primary pathophysiological event . Indeed, it has been postulated that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease . The increased prevalence of psoriasis among patients with other organ-specific inflammatory diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is consistent with this hypothesis . ","Psoriasis affects up to 3% of the population; however, there is considerable interracial variation in prevalence. The usual age of onset is 20-35 years. A family history of psoriasis is found in approximately 30% of patients. Evidence indicates that psoriasis is primarily an immunologic T-cell-driven disease requiring participation of both innate and T-cell-mediated mechanisms. Important environmental triggers include infection, drugs, and physical and psychological stress. Three key events characterize the pathophysiology of psoriasis: epidermal hyperproliferation, angiogenesis and accumulation of inflammatory cells. The impact of psoriasis on the patient's quality of life is similar - physically and emotionally - to that of ischemic heart disease, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

With accusations of infidelity, caregivers may feel that their safety is at risk, and delusions may lead to financial and social risks as well . Nursing home placement and mortality . Psychosis has been reported as the single most important precipitant for nursing home placement,, with a consequent increase in mortality . In one study of 11 subjects placed in nursing homes, all died within a 2-year follow-up period . Although other studies have not confirmed this high mortality rate, follow up of 59 subjects 3 years after they had enrolled in the first double-blind trial of clozapine for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) found that 42% of survivors were in nursing homes . During the study, 88% of the subjects had been living at home, with only 12% in nursing homes . In total, 25% of the subjects (15) had died, 6 of whom had died within a few months of completing the trial; none of the deaths was thought to be related to adverse drug effects . The mean duration from baseline (defined as the end of their participation in the 4-month study) to death was 8.3 months . Causes of death included pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction . Eight patients with mini-mental state examination score (MMSE) > 25 at entry were demented at follow up . Although all patients were treated at some point with clozapine, 37 of the 54 survivors continued to have psychotic symptoms beyond the first few months . Forty patients continued to be treated with antipsychotics, 23 on clozapine . Two subjects stopped clozapine because of granulocytopenia . No long-term follow up or short-term mortality was reported in the almost identical trial of clozapine that was performed in France . Studies of American healthcare costs have underscored the increased cost associated with PDP . A recent study reported that patients with PDP had yearly costs over twice as high as patients with PD but no psychosis, as well as an increased risk of falls (3 times higher) and twice the risk of fractures . A Medicare review (2000-2010) found that 75% of patients with PDP spent time in long-term care facilities, compared to 56% of patients with PD and no psychosis, and 36% of patients without PD . In addition, the patients with PDP stayed an average of 179 days, compared to 83 days for the non-psychotic patients and 22 days for the controls . The cost difference was $31 178 per year (PDP) versus $14 461 (non-psychotic) . A UK study of 7271 patients with PD (1994-2013) found that those with the disease required $3716 more for healthcare per year than age-matched controls without PD . In addition, patients with PD with greater disability, including psychosis, required an additional $1608 per year . Acute psychosis may require hospitalization, which is both costly and upsetting for the family . Drug-associated mortality . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that the deaths of patients receiving pimavanserin were likely to be due to underlying disease rather than drug effects . However, pimavanserin, like all other antipsychotic drugs, carries a black box warning of increased mortality . The warning for pimavanserin was purely derivative, based on data showing increased risk of death with antipsychotics, and did not take drug pharmacology into consideration . A 2-year chart review comparing mortality in 113 patients with PDP treated with pimavanserin with 505 who received quetiapine and 58 treated with both, found non-significant trends of increased mortality of 7.1%, 11.5% and 12.1%, respectively . The increased mortality associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs must be considered when making treatment plans . However, as no medical disorder has been associated with the increased death rate, it has not been possible to identify a mechanism or even a risk profile to identify those at greatest risk . While the FDA has requested that attempts be made to lower or discontinue antipsychotic use whenever possible, and American nursing homes are graded on their reduction of antipsychotic drug use, this should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time . ","Psychotic symptoms have been shown to be the single most important cause of nursing home placement in patients with PD. Healthcare costs have been found to be twice as high for patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) than for those without psychosis. Acute psychosis may require hospitalization. Causes for hospitalization include direct safety issues, both for the patient and their family. All antipsychotics carry a black box warning of increased mortality, which should be considered when making treatment plans. Although the FDA generally recommends that attempts be made to lower or discontinue antipsychotic use whenever possible, this should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time."
9781908541901,ch_3,"NSTEMI results from a partial (or a transient but complete) coronary occlusion and distal embolization of platelet-fibrin thrombi, compromising microcirculatory blood flow . Distal embolization can also occur in STEMI . Atherosclerotic plaque formation . These processes result in myocardial hypoperfusion . The macrophages avidly engulf the LDL cholesterol and transform into foam cells, leading to the formation of yellow fatty streaks . This last process further enhances the activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells and smooth muscle cells, and the inflamed endothelial cells further promote the adhesion and activation of platelets . Activated platelets serve as inflammatory mediators by expressing various membrane receptors capable of interacting with leukocytes and endothelial cells and thereby significantly contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis (Figures 1.3 and 1.4) . A vulnerable plaque is prone to rupture or erosion, leading to platelet-rich thrombosis generation and subsequently to ACS . Histologically, a vulnerable plaque consists of a thin-capped fibroatheroma that is enriched in cholesterol debris, a large number of inflammatory cells - especially macrophages, some activated T cells, and smooth muscle cells . Together, the leukocytes and endothelial cells proliferate at the plaque site and secrete extracellular matrix components and MMPs that degrade collagen and cause plaque erosion (see below) . Plaque rupture . thrombogenicity of the exposed plaque material (plaque vulnerability) . local flow disturbances (vessel vulnerability) . The underlying mechanisms of vulnerable plaque development (fibrous cap thinning and propensity to rupture) and thrombus generation at the site of plaque rupture are poorly understood . It has been demonstrated that only a small percentage of plaque ruptures occur at sites of severe arterial stenoses, and in most cases high-grade coronary arterial stenoses are preceded by multiple healed plaque ruptures . In addition to thrombus generation at the culprit plaque rupture site, multiple plaque ruptures and luminal thrombi may occur in ACS patients . Moreover, the risk of new thrombus generation at the site of a non-culprit lesion is high during the 12 months after initial presentation in ACS patients . Culprit lesions . Moreover, only occasionally (1%) a major life-threatening thrombus or acute coronary event develops at the site of a plaque rupture (Figure 1.6) . Thrombus generation . Platelets play a central role in the genesis of thrombosis at the site of vessel wall injury (Figure 1.7) . These factors facilitate platelet adhesion and activation . Following adhesion, platelets form a monolayer at the site of vessel wall injury (primary hemostasis) and undergo activation . The activation process results in morphologic changes coupled with intracellular calcium ion mobilization resulting in the release of procoagulant and proinflammatory microparticles and chemokines . Through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, these two locally generated secondary agonists play a critical role in sustaining platelet activation, and finally the activation of GPIIb/IIIa receptors (final common pathway) . Binding of activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors via fibrinogen molecules between adjacent platelets results in stable and robust thrombus generation at the site of vessel wall injury . It has been proposed that sustained platelet activation of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor and platelet procoagulant activity are critically dependent on continuous signaling downstream from the P2Y receptor, an important ADP receptor . Plaque rupture also results in tissue factor exposure at the site of vascular injury and the generation of small amounts of thrombin, the most potent primary platelet agonist . Thrombin further promotes platelet activation and the formation of a procoagulant platelet surface where larger amounts of thrombin are produced through the coagulation process . Finally, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin leading to the formation of an extensive fibrin network and a stable occlusive platelet-fibrin clot . The clinical manifestation of thrombus generation at the site of plaque rupture depends on the extent and duration of thrombotic occlusion . STEMI is often characterized by the complete obstruction of coronary vessels by 'red thrombi' rich in red blood cells and fibrin that overlay platelet-rich thrombi (see Figure 1.1) . ","The common underlying mechanism of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion, with differing degrees of superimposed thrombosis and distal embolization. Although atherosclerosis starts with the development of dysfunctional endothelium in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors early in life, the speed of progression is non-linear, unpredictable and varies markedly between individuals. A vulnerable plaque is prone to rupture or erosion and consists of a thin-capped fibroatheroma that is enriched in cholesterol debris, a large number of inflammatory cells (especially macrophages, some activated T cells), and smooth muscle cells. The major determinants of thrombus generation are those of the classic 'triad of Virchow': thrombogenicity of the exposed plaque material (plaque vulnerability), local flow disturbances (vessel vulnerability), and systemic thrombotic propensity (blood vulnerability). Mural platelet-rich 'white' thrombi most often incompletely block coronary blood flow and are present in unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) is often characterized by the complete obstruction of coronary vessels by thrombi rich in red blood cells and fibrin, which overlay platelet-rich thrombi."
9781910797693,chp1,"Definitions of these terms are provided in Table 1.1 . Biologics are large macromolecules, typically proteins . They range in size and structural complexity from simple proteins such as insulin and growth hormone to complex molecules such as coagulation factors and monoclonal antibodies, as shown in Figure 1.1 . Many biologics, particularly the monoclonal antibodies, are described as targeted therapies because they have been designed to interact with specific receptors on cells . Most biologics are complex mixtures; whilst their primary and secondary structures are known, they are less easily characterized at the tertiary level . The complex nature of the biologics, and their manufacturing processes, means that identical copies of these molecule cannot be created . A biosimilar, as its name suggests, is highly similar to the reference biologic product, but is not identical . The primary and secondary amino acid structure, dosing, and route of administration are the same; differences in formulation, presentation, and the administration device are permitted, provided that these differences do not affect safety or effectiveness . Inherent variation in biological products . There is inherent variability in the biologics themselves - an important point that is relevant to the discussion of biologics and biosimilars but is often overlooked . This variability has two main sources . The manufacturing process can affect important aspects of the structure of a biological drug; a copied biologic can therefore never be entirely identical to the original reference product . Thus, the active substance of a biosimilar and its reference medicine is almost the same biological substance but there may be minor differences as a result of their complex nature and production methods . Like the reference (originator) biologic, the biosimilar has a degree of natural variability . When a biosimilar is approved, this variability, and any differences between the biosimilar and the reference biologic, will have been shown not to affect safety or effectiveness . In addition, manufacturing processes change frequently over the life of a biologic, adding to the potential for variability . A 2016 study of all European-approved originator monoclonal antibodies identified a mean of 11 changes with moderate or high potential risk per drug . Process change can result from advances in technology, such as higher yielding host cell systems, improvements in bioreactor design, scaling up of production to meet demand or if production is moved to a new manufacturing site . Changes in manufacturing risks the introduction of more significant variation in the tertiary structure of a biologic, known as 'step changes' (see Figure 1.3) . Comparability of the drug before and after a step change needs to be demonstrated to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed . One example, a step change resulting from a new process in the manufacture of darbepoetin-alfa required confirmation through additional phase I, II and III studies . Bioidenticals and 'intended copy' biologics . Bioidenticals are products that are the same but have different brand names (as can also occur with small molecule drugs); some examples of bioidenticals are provided in Table 1.2 . These can arise when a product is co-developed but marketed by different manufacturers in different countries under different brand names . Different brand names may also be used for a biosimilar of a reference product that still has patent protection for some indications, particularly in Europe where the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approves medicines for use in more than 30 countries . 'Intended copy' biologics have arisen in markets with less stringent regulatory pathways, as a way to deliver affordable medicines . For example, in Mexico, 23 intended copy biologics had been registered as generics by 2011, and in Russia, 20 epoetins, 53 interferons, 42 monoclonal antibody drugs, 61 insulins, 11 somatropins, 24 filgrastims and 55 heparin versions had been approved to 2015 . Whilst intended copy biologics are unlikely to be encountered in clinical practice in the EU and USA, it should be borne in mind that such products have been misleadingly identified as biosimilars . Examples of clinical problems that have arisen following use of such products are described on page 36 . In the press, these products were referred to as biosimilars; incidents such as these may fuel concerns with true biosimilars where such concerns are unfounded . Note that intended copy biologics have also been referred to as 'non-comparable biotherapeutic products', 'biomimics' 'bio-generics' and 'bio-questionables' . ","Biologics are typically proteins, ranging in size from simple proteins to large, complex monoclonal antibodies. They are created in living systems. Inherent variability exists for all biologics and creates batch-to-batch variability for all products. Biosimilars are highly similar, but not identical, to their reference (originator) biologic. Furthermore, biologics themselves show inherent variation between batches (microheterogeneity), such that no batch is identical to previous batches. The slight differences between batches of biologics, or between biologics and biosimilars, are authorised and not expected to have any meaningful effect on clinical use. Changes to manufacturing processes can introduce significant changes to the tertiary structure of a biologic; analytics tests (and, exceptionally, new clinical trials) are required to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed."
9781910797310,chp6,"Chemotherapy is still the mainstay of systemic treatment for patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . This chapter describes treatment for patients without such actionable mutations . First-line chemotherapy . The use of a platinum-based combination is the backbone of first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC . However, some trials suggest that cisplatin may achieve higher response rates and survival outcomes . However, toxicity profiles may differ . Differences in survival outcomes have been reported depending on the histology of NSCLC . Three-(cytotoxic)-drug combinations do not give superior survival at 1 year (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.21, p =0.88) over two-drug combinations, but do significantly increase the number of toxic events . Combinations with targeted therapy are an alternative option for first-line systemic treatment in selected patients . Two randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), added to standard first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy . A significant bleeding rate of 4.4% was seen in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab group compared with 0.7% in the chemotherapy only group . Two phase III trials have evaluated the addition of necitumumab, a recombinant antibody targeting EGFR, to a two-drug platinum combination in patients with squamous and non-squamous lung cancer . Median OS was prolonged by a modest amount with the combination of the target therapy and cisplatin-gemcitabine in the squamous cell population . No other target agents have demonstrated clinically meaningful survival improvement in first-line treatment . Chemotherapy in the elderly . The survival benefit in fit, elderly patients with NSCLC receiving platinum-based combination treatment appears to be similar to that seen in younger patients . A survival benefit was demonstrated in patients aged 70-89 years who received a weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel combination compared with a single-agent regimen, despite an increased but manageable toxicity profile . Non-platinum-based combinations have not demonstrated a survival benefit over single agents in this population . Some series and prospective trials have shown survival benefit and improved symptom control with combinations compared with single agents in the elderly with PS2, although the benefit was much lower than that seen in patients with PS 0-1 . Duration of chemotherapy . Historically, continuation of cytotoxic chemotherapy combinations with the same two drugs for more than 4 cycles has shown no survival advantage but has increased related toxicities . However, these studies were done before the use of well-tolerated drugs like pemetrexed, which has now been evaluated as both a first-line combination therapy and a maintenance single agent . The two strategies for maintenance therapy following disease control after first-line treatment are continuous and switch maintenance . A benefit in PFS only was seen with the same strategy in combination with gemcitabine . Collectively, these data suggest that survival could be improved with maintenance pemetrexed for patients with non-squamous histology . Second-line chemotherapy . Almost all patients will eventually progress after first-line treatment and will require further treatment . Factors to take into account when choosing further therapy include PS, previous treatment, histology and whether a driver mutation is present . Two chemotherapy drugs are currently approved for second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC: docetaxel and pemetrexed . In 1999, a significant survival benefit (37% vs 11%) and improvement in disease-related symptoms was demonstrated with second-line docetaxel compared with BSC in patients with advanced NSCLC and good PS who had relapsed following a first-line platinum-based treatment . While combinations of cytotoxic drugs have been successful in improving efficacy compared with single agents in the first-line setting, the role of second-line combination therapy is less clear . Several randomized studies have been performed in patients with NSCLC comparing second-line docetaxel-based combination chemotherapy with docetaxel single agent: no significant differences in response rate, median survival or PFS were reported . In two randomized phase II trials, pemetrexed-based combination therapy produced a higher response rate than the single agent but showed no benefit in terms of survival . Second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy combined with a targeted agent has also shown promising results . ","Treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC without an actional somatic gene mutation consists of systemic chemotherapy; regimen selection is based on histology, comorbidities and performance status (PS). Platinum-based combinations are the backbone of first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. Pemetrexed regimens are restricted to non-squamous histology. Pemetrexed as continuous or switch maintenance prolongs survival over no maintenance in patients with non-squamous histologies and PS 0,1. Bevacizumab combined with a paclitaxel regimen can provide a survival benefit over a paclitaxel regimen alone in patients with non-squamous subgroups. Advanced age alone should not preclude appropriate NSCLC treatment. Two chemotherapy drugs have been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC in the second-line setting: docetaxel and pemetrexed. Platinum re-challenge could represent a potential option for fit, relapsed patients with a platinum-free interval treatment of more than 6 months."
9781912776696,hh-7,"A general approach to control the type I error (alpha = 0.05) would be to divide it across the endpoints that are being considered . The Bonferroni correction divides the 0.05 equally across all endpoints . For the four endpoints mentioned above, the significance level for each endpoint would be 0.05/4 = 0.0125 . Paying a price on the alpha in this way and using a reduced significance level enables researchers to draw confirmatory conclusions for the endpoints that are significant . For example, if two of the four endpoints are significant (p <= 0.0125) and two are non-significant (p > 0.0125) confirmatory conclusions can only be drawn about the two that are significant . For m tests, adjusted significant level = alpha/m . Achieving a significance level of 0.0125 is much more difficult than achieving a significance level of 0.05 and a larger sample size will be required . Non-equal division of the alpha . The Bonferroni correction would divide the 0.05 by 2 and assign a significance level of 0.025 to each endpoint . However, PFS is potentially the easier endpoint in terms of achieving statistical significance, possibly because there is likely to be a larger treatment effect on that endpoint or because, by definition, there will be more PFS events than OS events . In this case, it may make sense to assign a significance level of 0.01 for PFS and 0.04 for OS . The Hochberg approach . Suppose the p -values for three different endpoints have been calculated and ordered from largest to smallest . If the largest p -value is <= 0.05, then all endpoints have p -values <= 0.05 and confirmatory conclusions can be drawn for all three endpoints (Case 1 in Example 4.1) . If, however, the largest p -value is > 0.05, statistical significance cannot be declared for that endpoint . Instead, look to the endpoint with the second largest p -value . If that p -value is <= 0.025 (0.05/2) then that endpoint and the endpoint with the smallest p -value are statistically significant (Case 2 in Example 4.1) . If that p -value is <= 0.017 (0.05/3) then that endpoint is statistically significant (Case 3 in Example 4.1) . Note that if the Bonferroni correction is applied to Example 4.1, with an adjusted significance level of 0.017 for all three endpoints, the only statistically significant endpoint would be E in cases 2 and 3 . Hierarchical testing . In the approaches to multiple testing discussed above, paying a price on the alpha gives researchers the flexibility to cherry-pick significant p -values at a lower significance level . The endpoints are then tested in that order using 0.05 as the significance level, but the statistical significance can only be claimed down to the first non-significant result . Regulatory authorities would not allow these nominally significant p -values to be reported in the label . The hierarchical order . Hierarchical testing is a good way to think about primary and secondary endpoints when designing the study . Combining approaches . Subgroup evaluation . It is not uncommon for a study to show an impressive treatment difference in a key subgroup but fail in terms of the primary endpoint . Treatment differences within subgroups will occur by chance and, especially when there are a lot of subgroups, they are almost inevitable . Remember that 1 in 40 p -values will be statistically significant in favor of the experimental treatment by chance . An 'interesting' result in a subgroup would therefore only constitute an exploratory finding . The main reason for looking at subgroups in this way is to assess the consistency of an observed treatment effect . If a point estimate strays outside of the overall CI . homogeneity of treatment effect is still supported if the CI for that subgroup substantially overlaps the overall CI . Finally, it is not appropriate to discount subgroups in terms of a treatment benefit when the CI crosses the 'no effect' line . In Figure 4.1 the treatment effect in the subgroup of patients under 65 years in isolation is non-significant . This does not mean that the treatment does not work in that subgroup . The trial is powered to detect a treatment effect overall, the trial is not powered to detect treatment effects in much smaller subgroups . ","As several simultaneous statistical tests are usually conducted (exempli gratia for several different endpoints or time points, for the overall sample and several subgroups), the potential for a significant p -value to occur purely by chance increases. The overall type I error rate, known as the family-wise error rate must be controlled in every trial at 5%. The Bonferroni correction divides the 0.05 equally across all endpoints; for example, for four endpoints, the significance level for each endpoint would be 0.05/4 = 0.0125. The decision to do this must be made in the study protocol. The Hochberg approach places the p -values in order, from largest to smallest, and then assigns a different significance level to each; for example, <= 0.05 to the largest, <= 0.025 (0.05/2) to the next and 0.017 (0.05/3) to the next, and so on. In hierarchical testing (or closed testing), the endpoints of interest are ranked from most important to least important before the study begins. The endpoints are then tested in that order using 0.05 as the significance level. The statistical significance can only be claimed down to the first non-significant result. Attention should not be refocused on strong subgroup results because of the problem of multiplicity. If there is a good clinical argument that supports a strong effect in a subgroup, then that subgroup should be built into the confirmatory testing strategy from the beginning of the study. Forest plots are a good way of graphically displaying the results of subgroup analyses."
9781910797273,chp4,"Treating and preventing relapses . Corticosteroids are the mainstay of acute treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses . There are conflicts in the data regarding effectiveness of steroids, with some studies suggesting steroids improve overall outcome after relapse and others showing transient worsening after steroids . However, evidence supporting the use of oral prednisolone/prednisone is limited and there is no indication for prolonged oral steroid therapy following MS relapse . For this reason, high-dose oral or intravenous methylprednisolone is the preferred treatment choice for acute relapse . There are times when patients cannot tolerate intravenous or oral steroids, or second therapy is necessary for more severe relapses . PLEX improves functioning after relapse; a recent study showed that second-line PLEX treatment for severe optic neuritis improves visual functioning by more than 50% . It can be considered if a patient has suboptimal response to steroids . Intravenous Ig has demonstrated inconsistent results in MS, mainly because of the small study sizes used . It can be used in MS; however, there is no Class I evidence to confirm its efficacy . Larger studies, in particular the placebo-controlled PrevANZ study of vitamin D supplementation in patients with clinically isolated syndrome, are awaited with interest . In the interim, many patients with MS with low or low-normal vitamin D levels are empirically treated with dietary vitamin D supplementation .

For example, the 'Fatigue: Applying Cognitive behavioral and Energy effectiveness Techniques to lifeStyle (FACETS)' program has shown some benefit in patients with MS . Amantadine, 100 mg twice daily, may exert a modest effect in some patients, but solid clinical trial data are lacking, and anticholinergic side effects limit its utility in patients with MS . However, bowel and particularly bladder symptoms (frequency, urgency, urge incontinence) can become established and chronic in MS . Investigation of bladder dysfunction in MS includes . All patients should be advised to maintain adequate fluid intake . They may also be used as required in patients with mild urinary frequency and urgency . A specialist urologic review should be sought for all patients who do not respond to anticholinergic therapies . Pain is a common accompaniment of MS . It can be divided into acute and chronic pain . Acute pain . Paroxysmal pain syndromes . Trigeminal neuralgia is a common acute presentation in MS and may be clinically indistinguishable from the idiopathic counterpart . Acute burning/dysesthetic (spinothalamic) pain occasionally accompanies MS relapse . Inflammatory pain . The acute inflammation associated with demyelination may give rise to pain . Migrainous pain . For reasons that are unclear, migraine is more common in patients with MS than in the general population . Some clinicians speculate that this may be due to altered brainstem function in patients with MS, particularly those with lesions in the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain . Chronic pain . reduce fatigue . Pharmacological treatment . The first drug to improve walking in MS was approved in the USA in 2010 . Prolonged-release fampridine, a formulation of 4-aminopyridine, is an orally administered potassium-channel blocker that improves walking in some patients with MS . In Europe, it is licensed for patients with an EDSS of 4.0-7.0 . Mood disorders, particularly depression, are extremely common in MS . A concurrent mood disorder may have a profound effect on both physical and cognitive functioning in patients with MS and must be sought and treated aggressively with a program of behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy and physical exercise . ","Disabling multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses should be treated with high-dose (500-1000 mg/day) short-course (3-5 days) intravenous or oral methylprednisolone. Corticosteroid therapy hastens recovery from acute relapse but may not affect ultimate function. There is no indication for prolonged oral steroid therapy following MS relapse. Moderate dose (60 mg/day) oral corticosteroid therapy for optic neuritis may increase the risk of recurrence and should be avoided. MS symptoms including pain, spasticity and sphincter dysfunction are a source of significant disability and should be treated proactively. Spasticity may be severe and is managed in most patients with a combination of physical therapy and oral medication. In severe focal spasticity, botulinum toxin injections have a role. Bladder dysfunction commonly manifests with urinary frequency, urgency and urge incontinence and is ameliorated with anticholinergic therapy in most patients with low urinary residual volumes (< 100 mL). Intermittent self-catheterization should be considered in patients with significant urinary retention (urinary residual volume > 100 mL), and formal urodynamic studies may be indicated to exclude complex bladder dysfunction. Pain in MS most commonly has a neuropathic origin and responds to anticonvulsant therapy or antidepressant (tricyclic or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) therapy. Impaired mobility is a dominant feature of progressive MS, and function should be optimized through multidisciplinary care, provision of appropriate walking aids and, in selected cases, symptomatic treatment with fampridine. Depression complicates the course of MS in up to 40% of patients and should be proactively managed with a program of physical exercise, behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy as indicated."

These effects are proportional to the fat content of the diet and so may encourage patients to reduce the amount of fat they consume . Depression is frequent in patients with obesity and requires specific management in order to effectively implement a weight management program (see Management) . Managing expectations . Weight-loss drugs should only be used as part of a comprehensive weight management program, as this is when they are most effective . Efficacy of pharmacotherapy for weight loss and maintenance of weight loss . Effect on metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors . Whereas obese patients tend to place most importance on the degree of weight loss that they can, or plan to, achieve, the treating clinician is more concerned with the effect of weight loss on the patient's metabolic and cardiovascular risk profile . Patients with higher baseline plasma glucose levels have a greater improvement in glycemic control . Effects on blood pressure are important considerations in relation to pharmacotherapy . Bariatric surgery is among the most clinically effective procedures in medicine . 'Bariatric surgery' refers to surgical procedures that lead directly to weight loss, used in the management of obesity and related comorbidities . Types of bariatric surgery . Weight loss outcomes are excellent and durable and the procedure is reversible . The procedure is no longer performed because of poor long-term outcomes . The operation is rare, and rigorous patient selection is required . Early studies show significant sustained weight loss alongside improvements in HbA 1c . The best outcome for long-term weight loss is with bariatric surgery . Average weight loss after 12 months was 57.8% of excess weight (67.8% for gastric bypass), and diabetes resolved in 85.5% of patients . Diabetes was completely resolved in 76.8% of patients and resolved or improved in 86% . Hyperlipidemia improved in 70% or more of patients . Hypertension was resolved in 61.7% of patients and resolved or improved in 78.5% . Obstructive sleep apnea was resolved in 85.7% of patients and was resolved or improved in 83.6% of patients . It was started in 1987 and included over 4000 patients, who either underwent substantial weight loss by bariatric surgery or remained weight stable by conventional non-surgical management . All three surgical groups demonstrated maximum weight loss after 1 year . After 10 years, 4% of control patients had lost more than 20% of their original weight, compared with 74% of the patients in the gastric bypass group . Patients with morbid obesity are eligible for bariatric surgery using the criteria drawn up by the 1991 NIH Consensus Conference Statement on Gastrointestinal Surgery for Severe Obesity . For all other patients, weight reduction surgery can only be considered when non-surgical measures have failed . However, the numbers more than quadrupled between 1998 and 2002 - from 13 386 to 71 733—including a 900% increase in procedures on patients between the ages of 55 and 64 years . The appropriate procedure is laparoscopic RYGB performed by a very experienced surgeon . RYGB has been shown to be effective and improve severely abnormal eating behaviors in children and adolescents with hypothalamic obesity . Mental health problems are highly prevalent in grossly obese patients, including eating disorders, depression, low self-esteem and suicidal ideas . The risk:benefit ratio must be considered individually for each patient before surgery, and patients may be deemed unsuitable for surgery depending on their comorbidities and anesthetic risk . Surgical risk . Renal clearance of drugs is faster because of increased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate; calculating drug dosages in obese patients is complex . There may also be an increase in alcohol sensitivity and addiction and patients must be counseled accordingly . Bariatric surgery can have huge psychological implications for the individual . The patient will experience changes in body image and self-esteem . The way the patient is viewed by their spouse, friends, relatives and the public will also change . Individuals may have attributed all their problems to their excess weight only to find that weight loss has no effect on their mental health state . In some studies rates of suicide have increased after bariatric surgery . Some patients are so desperate to lose weight at any cost that they do not give much thought to 'life after surgery' . They also need to be aware of the patients who are suitable for surgery and the operative criteria . ","Pharmacotherapy should only be used as an adjunct to lifestyle modification. Pharmacotherapy is more effective for the maintenance than induction of weight loss but must be used on an ongoing basis to maintain the effect. Pharmacotherapy improves the cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity. Orlistat has been shown to be safe and effective, and to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, over a 4-year period. Bariatric surgery is among the most clinically effective and cost-effective procedures in medicine. The majority of cases of diabetes resolve after bariatric surgery. Adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are performed laparoscopically."
9781912776153,chp1,"Normal conduction . Conduction is the speed at which cells propagate electrical wavefronts . Normal depolarization within the heart occurs in one direction from the top (atria) downwards . The normal conduction pathway within the heart is described below (Figure 1.1) . Atrioventricular node depolarization . Septal depolarization . The QRS width is also relatively narrow because of the rapidity of conduction within the specialized His-Purkinje conducting tissues, which include the bundle branches . The atrial rate is usually 300 bpm . AF is now thought to be related to a complex re-entry mechanism . These changes promote areas of re-entry within the body of the left atrium that maintain the AF . Less commonly, and usually in younger patients, VT arises in a structurally normal heart . During normal conduction, the depolarizing wavefront arrives at a constant speed within the ventricular myocardium . Recovery occurs at a constant speed in the opposite direction to depolarization . Ventricular ectopics are often the trigger . In patients with structurally normal hearts, automaticity may be responsible for triggering VT . Sometimes the VT circuit covers a relatively large area and may have complex re-entry circuits . These are often deep within the myocardium and occur over a relatively large area, which is why ablation is often difficult and less successful than if the abnormal substrate area is microscopic (as in SVTs) . VF has been described in 'normal' hearts and is often related to an early cycle ventricular ectopic falling within the vulnerable period of ventricular recovery . The conduction properties of the AV node are unique . Thereafter, the AV node will begin to block conduction . This slowing phenomenon of AV nodal tissue is known as decremental conduction and is characteristic of the AV node (accessory pathways very rarely demonstrate decrementation) . Despite this relative slowing effect, it is still possible to maintain very rapid heart rates during tachycardia, emphasizing how complex conduction within the heart can be . This type of AV block does not usually require treatment . The heart rate often varies with respiration, speeding up with inspiration and slowing with expiration . Intracardiac conduction is slowed and, in certain patients, AV nodal conduction can be slowed significantly . Classification of arrhythmias . Mechanisms of arrhythmias . Generally, arrhythmias can be divided into two broad mechanisms . disorders of impulse formation - abnormal automaticity or triggered activity . There are two types: abnormal automaticity and triggered activity . Abnormal automaticity . Slow atrial, junctional and ventricular escape rhythms are automatic in nature . It is thought the commonest 'arrhythmias' - ventricular and atrial ectopics - also arise from this mechanism . Accessory pathways . These accessory pathways (also known as bypass tracts) are usually anatomically separate from the specialized conducting tissue (Figure 1.3) . Narrow-complex tachycardia . This usually occurs during SVT and nearly always signifies a non-life-threatening arrhythmia . a problem with the specialized conducting tissue . bypassing of the specialized conducting tissue . Although WCTs can occur during SVT, they are uncommon . Sinus node re-entry tachycardia . The best-described re-entrant circuit occurs in WPW syndrome . In these patients, an accessory pathway (sometimes referred to as a bundle of Kent) exists in addition to the normal conduction pathway; occasionally, more than one pathway occurs in the same patient . Conduction is slowed through the AV node as normal, but it is not slowed through the accessory pathway . Antidromic tachycardia occurs in fewer than 5% of cases . This tachycardia is often misdiagnosed as ventricular in origin . Concealed accessory pathways . The resting ECG is therefore normal . The AV nodal area is complex . The atrial rate is often 150-250 bpm . If, as is more usual, the abnormal area is localized, it can be treated by focal ablation, which is usually successful (Figure 1.8) . ","Cardiac cells have the unique ability to depolarize rhythmically; depolarization normally occurs in one direction from the top down, from atria to ventricles. The fibrous atrioventricular (AV) ring, which supports the mitral and tricuspid valves, behaves as an electrical insulator: conduction to the ventricles occurs only over the AV node, unless there is an abnormal or aberrant connection. The AV node has a decremental slowing effect on conduction. Autonomic effects on the heart (sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli) can significantly influence cardiac conduction. Re-entry is the most frequent mechanism for arrhythmias. The substrate for an arrhythmia is an abnormal electrical pathway or a region of scarred myocardium. The trigger is an atrial or ventricular ectopic beat. Narrow QRS complex arrhythmias signify depolarization of the ventricle over the usual His-Purkinje system. Most supraventricular tachycardias have narrow QRS complexes. Wide- (broad-) complex tachycardias need further investigation, and patients should be referred for urgent assessment. They should be considered ventricular in origin until proven otherwise."
9781908541901,ch_7,"Over the past decade, clinical outcomes for patients with STEMI have improved as a result of increased awareness, speed of diagnosis, and treatment with both reperfusion and adjuvant medical therapy . Despite these developments, thousands of STEMI patients fail to receive critical therapy in a timely fashion each year, and nearly 30% do not receive any reperfusion treatment . Clinical presentation . MIs can be clinically silent and unrecognized by the patient . These patients are more likely to be older, women, diabetic and/or have previous heart failure . In 25-30% of patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), initial angiography shows a patent infarct-related artery . In these patients, it is presumed that spontaneous, endogenous lysis occurred before angiography . In the emergency department, the management of patients with suspected STEMI includes pain control, rapid identification of patients eligible for urgent reperfusion therapy, triaging lower-risk patients to the appropriate setting in the hospital and avoiding inappropriate discharge of patients with STEMI . In patients with hypoxemia, oxygen should be administered by nasal prongs or face mask . mechanical (PCI) . Patients without ST-segment elevation are not candidates for immediate pharmacological reperfusion but should receive anti-ischemic therapy and catheter-based therapy . Early mortality risk assessment can be based on the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) risk score for STEMI . primary PCI (first-line) . Indications for primary PCI are shown in Table 5.1 . In patients presenting early, with a large amount of myocardium at risk, the delay should be less than 60 minutes from FMC . Patients with contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy have a higher morbidity and mortality than those eligible for this therapy . Primary PCI is the preferred treatment for patients in shock . Except for patients in cardiogenic shock, only the culprit lesion should be dilated in the acute setting . An immediate transfer of patients to a PCI-capable center after initiation of fibrinolytic therapy usually helps to shorten the time until rescue PCI . STEMI networks . In Europe, 20-95% of patients with STEMI undergo primary PCI, and numbers are increasing, a range that reflects local resources and capabilities . Fibrinolytic therapy . Early fibrinolytic therapy is associated with similar outcomes to primary PCI, if early angiography and PCI were performed in those patients who needed intervention . The most common sources of bleeding are procedure related . is recommended in all patients with STEMI as early as possible, with same initial dose as for UA/NSTEMI (see Chapter 4), and low-dose ASA, 75-100 mg/day, continued indefinitely . In patients intolerant to ASA, clopidogrel is indicated as an alternative . In STEMI patients referred for primary PCI, international guidelines recommend that prasugrel should be administered as soon as possible . At the same time, unanticipated antiplatelet therapy cessation may put patients at an increased risk for adverse events . This trial further confirmed the preferred use of bivalirudin as an anticoagulant in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI . In the ATOLL trial, enoxaparin, 0.5 mg intravenous bolus, was compared with UH in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI . Fondaparinux is not recommended at all in primary PCI for acute STEMI patients because of concerns for catheter-related thrombus and interventional complications . Nitroglycerin is administered in STEMI patients to relieve ischemic pain and also as a vasodilator in patients with LV failure . Intravenous beta-blockers are used in patients with STEMI regardless of the planned reperfusion strategy, but must be avoided in patients with hypotension or heart failure . Oral treatment should be considered during hospital stay and continued thereafter in all STEMI patients without contraindications, and is indicated in patients with heart failure or LV dysfunction . An angiotensin receptor blocker, preferably valsartan, is an alternative in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors . High-dose statins should be initiated or continued early after admission in all STEMI patients without contraindication or history of intolerance, regardless of initial cholesterol values . ","Immediate recognition of STEMI with timely initiation of reperfusion therapies is associated with improved outcomes. The selection of reperfusion strategy in STEMI (pharmacological versus invasive) is critically dependent on the time from onset of symptoms, mortality risk of STEMI and bleeding risk. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred choice of revascularization in STEMI patients if it can be offered within 90-120 minutes of diagnosis. Prasugrel and ticagrelor have superseded clopidogrel as the gold standard in dual antiplatelet therapy. In the European guidelines, bivalirudin is the anticoagulant of choice during primary PCI, while enoxaparin has its merits as an adjuvant to thrombolytic therapy. Whereas, in the US guidelines there is no general preference for bivalirudin over unfractionated heparin and there is no recommendation for enoxaparin."
9781912776139,ch2,"Although the incidence of ALS is not thought to be increasing, greater life expectancy and improved ascertainment mean that more cases are being recorded . In common with other neurodegenerative disorders, age is the leading risk factor for the development of ALS . An individual's risk of developing ALS increases with age, but the overall lifetime risk is estimated to be 1 in 400 . ALS case reports from the early 20th century in the European literature also had a consistently lower mean age, which has been attributed to reduced life expectancy at that time . 'What is the cause of ALS?' This question has no single answer . Genetic factors . Most cases of ALS appear to arise sporadically; only 5-10% of individuals are known to have familial ALS, which usually affects a first-degree relative . Nevertheless, approximately 15% of all cases of ALS are associated with a variety of autosomal and largely dominant single nucleotide gene mutations or a repeat expansion (Figure 2.1) . The genetic landscape of ALS has continued to expand since a linkage study in 1993 identified mutations in the SOD1 gene . SOD1 mutations account for 20% of familial cases but fewer than 2% of all ALS cases . In keeping with the 'multi-hit' hypothesis mentioned above, symptom onset tends to occur at an earlier age in genetically driven ALS . The main exception is SOD1 -related ALS, which has a markedly reduced susceptibility to broader cognitive impairment (in contrast to C9orf72 HRE-associated ALS, in which it is far more common) . The syndrome shares some of the clinical features of ALS, but also other neurodegenerative disorders . Data in relation to exposure to electromagnetic fields, residentially or occupationally, as a risk factor for ALS are unclear . Premorbid athleticism among those who develop ALS has been postulated for many decades . Cardiovascular disease may be under represented in those with ALS and their relatives, but this is uncertain and confounded by other considerations such as physical activity . Many people with established ALS experience accelerated weight loss in the months before the onset of symptoms and throughout the disease course . Smoking is a relatively weak risk factor for ALS . Finally, those diagnosed with ALS have been anecdotally observed to have a more favorable temperament than those with other chronic neurological conditions . No conclusive results have emerged from attempts to demonstrate more sociable or altruistic personality traits premorbidly in those who develop ALS . SOD1 -mediated ALS shares much of the core clinical phenotype of sporadic ALS and SOD1 was the first gene to be linked to familial ALS . This finding underpins most of the literature implicating cellular oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ALS . However, TDP-43 aggregation (see page 21) is common to 97% of ALS cases, familial or not, yet SOD1 ALS is not a 'TDP-43-opathy' . The discovery of the predominantly RNA-binding protein TDP-43 as the cellular signature of nearly all cases of ALS was supported by the identification of mutations in the TARDBP gene, albeit in very rare cases of familial ALS . It is therefore unsurprising that viable mutations of the parent gene represent fewer than 0.5% of all cases of ALS . However, further support for the concept of deranged RNA processing underlying ALS was provided by the discovery of another rare cause of familial ALS, namely mutations in another RNA-binding gene, FUS . Superficially, ALS lacks the typical epidemiological or phenotypic characteristics of primary autoimmune disorders . Current research on neuroinflammation in ALS is intertwined with an interest in the health of oligodendrocytes; their failure to support motor neurons in ALS may have a primary role in the pathogenesis of the disease . Short-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have demonstrated consistently increased excitability of the cortex in ALS, and at least some months before the onset of symptoms in carriers of highly penetrant ALS-causing genetic mutations . Modeling ALS . The inability to safely biopsy the human nervous system is one reason why the ALS disease process has to be investigated using animal and cellular models . The discovery, in 1993, of mutations in the SOD1 gene in cases of familial ALS was rapidly followed by the creation of a transgenic mouse model . The SOD1 G93A mouse became the foundation of most preclinical studies in ALS for the next 20 years . Given our increasing understanding of ALS as a disorder of the brain, it can be argued that these changes represent downstream effects . ","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is thought to involve a multistep pathogenesis with a variable mixture of predominantly genetic or environmentally mediated factors. Approximately 90% of cases appear to occur sporadically. The lifetime risk of developing ALS increases with age. A sizable body of epidemiological evidence, albeit mostly retrospectively acquired, supports a common clinical perception of premorbid athleticism and lower body mass index in ALS. Multiple and diverse cellular pathways, many involving cells adjacent to the motor neuron, are implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. An intronic hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 underpins around 10% of all cases of ALS in the Western hemisphere. RNA mishandling is a core theme underlying the aggregated TDP-43 signature that defines the ALS syndrome. Rodent modeling of ALS has been disappointing in terms of human therapeutic translation. Cellular models currently lack the ability to study neuronal network integrity."
9781908541963,chapter3,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world . In the USA, approximately 2 million people suffer from an alcohol-induced liver disorder . In the UK in 2012, ALD accounted for 63% (4425) of all alcohol-related deaths, an 18% increase on 2002 . Medical costs associated with caring for these patients are enormous . Intervention for patients presenting with the early stages of liver injury helps to prevent further permanent liver injury . Interrupting alcoholism is the key, but this is not an easy task and frustrates many primary care providers, families and patients . Patients may present anywhere along the spectrum of ALD . Those with isolated steatosis usually have few symptoms or signs of liver disease and are typically identified only by abnormal liver tests . Patients with alcoholic hepatitis are usually jaundiced and report fatigue, malaise and anorexia . The liver is enlarged and tender, and ascites and edema are often present . Patients with established cirrhosis usually display signs of portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly, caput medusae and ascites . Liver function tests . Examination of laboratory results is helpful in diagnosing ALD . The last two are good markers of the severity of ALD . However, it should also be noted that liver function tests may be entirely normal in the presence of cirrhosis, particularly if the patient has achieved sobriety . This is particularly true when the patient's history is suggestive of ALD, there is no evidence of viral hepatitis and biopsy could be difficult (id est patients with coagulopathy or severe ascites) . Concomitant disease . It is important to rule out other forms of liver disease and to document any concomitant injurious agents . Chronic hepatitis C and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis B are common in patients with alcoholism . Although most patients who drink alcohol never develop significant liver disease, and many patients with viral hepatitis do well over long periods of time, the combination of viral hepatitis and alcoholism often accelerates the development of advanced liver injury . Thus, identification of a patient with both diseases is important . There is an interesting parallel between ALD and the more recently recognized non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; see Chapter 6), which is usually seen in patients with insulin resistance, obesity or diabetes . Once fat appears in the liver, a similar progression of events occurs in some patients, resulting in irreversible scarring in the liver . Accurate determination of alcohol consumption can be difficult, however, as patients often under-report how much alcohol they consume, and denial is common . Small amounts of alcohol would not be expected to cause ALD in men and, if it can be confirmed that a patient consumes only a small amount of alcohol, other causes of liver disease must be considered . Achieving abstinence typically requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, professional alcoholism counselors and, often, mental health professionals . This requires a substantial commitment on the part of the patient and the patient's family . Ideally, the patient will be encouraged by the knowledge that, with cessation of alcohol intake, their liver function is likely to improve substantially . Alcoholics are usually malnourished, and improving nutrition is associated with improved outcomes . This is particularly important for patients with alcoholic hepatitis . Most alcoholics need protein . Unfortunately, however, a few patients with advanced liver disease develop hepatic encephalopathy when given large amounts of protein . Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammatory condition . Thus, corticosteroids are a logical treatment for ALD . Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been recorded in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and clinical outcome appears to correlate with TNF levels . Efforts to decrease TNF levels have shown some promise in the treatment of patients with alcoholic hepatitis . One study has documented that pentoxifylline improved survival in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, presumably by interfering with TNF . Liver transplantation for patients with ALD remains a controversial topic . Most transplant centers will consider patients with ALD as candidates for transplantation provided they have a documented period of abstinence from alcohol of at least 6 months before transplantation is considered . Unfortunately, some patients do return to drinking following transplant, although long-term success is common . ","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease. Early intervention prevents permanent injury, but interrupting alcoholism can be difficult. Patients with ALD typically have mild to moderate elevations in aminotransferases, with AST > ALT. Patients with ALD are often malnourished; improving nutrition is an important treatment goal. Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis may benefit from corticosteroids or pentoxifylline."
9781910797105,ch12,"First episodes of psychosis can go undetected and untreated for long periods of time . The median duration of positive psychotic symptoms before detection is 12-24 weeks, but in many cases symptoms endure for much longer before detection, particularly if negative symptoms are taken into account . The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is strongly associated with response to treatment and speed to remission in the first episode, although it is still disputed whether this is truly a causal link . Nonetheless, this observation is the main impetus behind the increased focus on early detection and treatment of the first episode of schizophrenia . Early detection . First, is it possible to detect, and so treat, people earlier in their first episode? Second, if so, will earlier treatment lead to better outcomes? . Some of the reasons for delayed detection are given in Table 12.1 . Public education, training of family physicians and youth workers in recognizing early signs, and specialist rapid assessment teams have been shown in pilot early-intervention services to reduce median DUP to 6 weeks, with a concomitant reduction in symptom severity by the time treatment is initiated . Randomized controlled trials of whole services suggest that early detection and intervention improve medium-term outcomes . Only part of the link between long DUP and poor outcome is explained by the fact that a long DUP leads to more severe symptoms by the time treatment is commenced (Table 12.2) . Optimal treatment in the first episode . Key elements of an early intervention strategy are given in Table 12.3 . Short-term outcome from the first episode is good in 85% of cases, with remission usually achieved within 3 months . Patients in the first episode are responsive to relatively low doses of antipsychotic drugs, and treatment should be started with the equivalent of haloperidol, 2 mg daily, or less . Similarly, first-episode patients are sensitive to the neurological and metabolic adverse effects of drugs . Added cognitive behavioral therapy speeds remission and helps maintain recovery . Although remission from the first episode is usual, 50% of people relapse within the following 2 years and 80% within the following 5 years . Prodromal states: can schizophrenia be prevented? . It is possible to identify individuals in the community who are at very high risk of developing schizophrenia in the near future . Table 12.4a summarizes the descriptions of such cases with so-called prodromal or clinical-high-risk symptoms . In DSM-5, these symptoms are listed as a 'condition for further study' (Table 12.4b) . Overall, follow-up studies of individuals seeking help for these symptoms show that a significant proportion develop schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder over the following 12 months . Early follow-up studies of clinical-high-risk cases suggested rates of transition of 40%, although more recent studies suggest that 10-15% is more representative . If effective drug or psychological interventions are given at this prodromal stage, it may be feasible to prevent, delay or at least ameliorate subsequent psychosis in such cases (Case history 12.1) . Randomized trials have shown that second-generation antipsychotic drug treatments reduce rates of transition to schizophrenia and that cognitive therapy may also do so . While this is one of the most promising current research areas, the ethical issues relating to the treatment of individuals, most of whom will not go on to develop psychosis, still need to be fully explored . ","Duration of untreated psychosis is usually 3-6 months. The longer the delay in treatment, the worse the clinical outcome. Early detection has been shown to be possible. Second generation drugs are preferred. Treatment of prodromal cases with cognitive behavioral or drug therapy may prevent or delay schizophrenia."
9781910797853,chp6,"As a consequence, supportive care has become increasingly important for patients with leukemia . Blood transfusions are among the most important forms of supportive care for patients with leukemia . Packed red blood cells should be given to patients with hemoglobin levels lower than 7-8 g/dL (higher if the patient has significant cardiovascular or respiratory compromise) . Prophylaxis and treatment of infections . Patients with leukemia are at high risk of infection, partly because of the disease itself and partly because of the immune dysfunction induced by chemotherapy . Effective prevention and treatment of infections is therefore central to disease management . Food safety is important during and after cancer treatment because immunologic impairment renders the patient more susceptible to food-borne illnesses . Stricter diets may be advised if the patient has undergone HSCT . However, studies have not shown any significant differences in infection rates in patients given neutropenic diets . Treatment of infection . Such sources may include . therapies should be considered for patients with sinopulmonary issues . It should be noted that signs and symptoms of infection may not be obvious in patients receiving steroids . Growth factor treatment . Such treatment may be considered in patients with leukemia at high risk of complications from infection . In practice, use of growth factors varies between centers, depending on the disease, the timing in relation to treatment and patient factors . In patients with ALL, a number of randomized clinical studies have been undertaken to determine the optimal duration of G-CSF treatment during induction chemotherapy . The benefits include . As in patients with ALL, overall survival rates did not differ between treated patients and controls . Currently, few data support the concurrent use of GM-CSF in patients with ALL at the time of chemotherapy induction . Importantly, neutrophil recovery rates were improved and overall survival significantly improved in patients given GM-CSF . The use of GM-CSF varies between centers, but it may be particularly helpful in patients with a slow recovery after chemotherapy . Managing fatigue . CRF is almost universal in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy . Patients usually recover after treatment, although some cancer survivors report that it can remain troublesome even after treatment . As such, it is important not to overlook the effect of CRF on patients' wellbeing . Patients with moderate or severe fatigue require more focused evaluation . Treatment of nausea and vomiting . Importantly, CINV can lead to patients refusing further courses of chemotherapy . Treatment of hyperuricemia . Patients with a high risk of tumor lysis syndrome may benefit from rasburicase, given as monotherapy . Central venous catheters facilitate the management of patients with leukemia, and they are commonly used to deliver intensive induction chemotherapy to patients with AML . Managing pain . Patients with leukemia may experience pain caused by the disease itself, complications of the disease, invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment effects or unrelated medical conditions (Table 6.5) . Prevention of pain . Oral and gastrointestinal mucositis can affect any patient undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT . It can be so severe as to delay further treatment . Treatment of pain . Treatment of the leukemia itself is a primary option for reducing pain . Conversely, these treatments can be the cause of further pain . Pain treatments include . patient education about pain . The intensity of treatment can be increased according to the individual patient's needs, taking into account patient-specific variables such as performance status, comorbidities and concurrent medications . Treatment of splenomegaly . There are three approaches to management in patients with chronic leukemia . Fertility considerations before chemotherapy . Certain leukemia treatments, such as some chemotherapy regimens or HSCT, can impair fertility, and this may be an important concern for younger patients wishing to start a family . Before treatment, fertility issues should be raised with all patients with reproductive potential . Patients wishing to preserve their fertility should be counseled by a fertility specialist about their options . These include . End of life care in advanced disease . Retrospective studies in patients with leukemia and other hematologic malignancies have shown that in the last month of life patients experience bleeding, infections, pain, shortness of breath, CNS disturbances and fatigue . individuals or organizations providing daily support to patients and carers at home or in hospital . ","Supportive care for patients with leukemia manages the effects of disease activity and progression, as well as the adverse effects of therapy. Transfusion support, with or without the use of blood growth factors, may be required at many points in the disease process and becomes essential to continued survival in the later stages. The prevention and treatment of infection are of paramount importance. It is important not to overlook the importance of cancer-related fatigue. The level and nature of fatigue should be regularly assessed. Failure to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on the first day of chemotherapy increases the risk of CINV on subsequent days and in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. Well-established guidelines for the use of effective antiemetic regimens are available. Patients with leukemia may experience pain caused by the disease itself, complications of the disease, invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment effects or unrelated medical conditions. Management of pain therefore requires a multidisciplinary approach. Surviving cancer can have a profound and lasting impact on patients, affecting both physical and mental health, professional and personal identity, sexuality and financial standing. Patients surviving leukemia may require support in a number of areas. The aim of palliative care is to provide the best possible quality of life for patients with advanced and untreatable disease and their families."
9781908541468,ch_5,"AKI is seen in up to 5% of hospital patients, and is far more common in the elderly . Pregnancy can also cause AKI (Table 3.1), and renal disease can present for the first time during pregnancy . AKI may result from poor perfusion of the kidneys (prerenal), intrinsic renal disease or urinary tract obstruction (postrenal) . In general, prerenal AKI will recover rapidly once kidney perfusion is re-established . However, reversible prerenal AKI overlaps with, and may lead to, established AKI owing to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) . In ATN, the degree of tubular damage is such that kidney recovery is often delayed for 2 weeks or longer . ATN is by far the most common cause of AKI, and is often seen in postoperative patients in a hospital setting, and in those with severe infections or multisystem disease (Table 3.2) . Important questions . Is it truly prerenal AKI? It is important to establish whether patients with poor kidney perfusion and accumulation of toxic metabolites have true prerenal AKI or whether they have established ATN . Were the kidneys previously normal? It is important to establish whether acute uremia is due to AKI in previously normal kidneys, or whether it represents a rapid decline against a background of chronic kidney disease (CKD), id est acute on chronic kidney failure . In acute on chronic kidney failure, renal abnormalities, such as small kidneys in chronic glomerulonephritis or large cystic kidneys in adult polycystic kidney disease, will almost always be present . It is necessary to decide whether the acute uremic episode represents the natural history of these diseases, or whether exacerbating factors that may be reversible are responsible . Is an obstruction present? If obstruction could be the cause of AKI, kidney function may improve rapidly once the obstruction is relieved . This should be revealed by renal ultrasonography . Intrinsic renal disease . Established AKI is most often due to ATN . The most common cause of ATN is prolonged renal ischemia due to reduced kidney perfusion, which may be a result of volume depletion, septicemia, cardiac failure or renal artery obstruction . When the cause of AKI is unclear, a number of blood tests may be helpful (Table 3.3) . Postrenal acute kidney injury . Postrenal AKI is usually the result of obstruction of the lower urinary tract by calculi, tumors or prostatic hypertrophy . AKI due to obstruction generally resolves once it is relieved by placement of a bladder catheter or percutaneous nephrostomy . Prolonged obstruction may lead to irreversible kidney damage . Management of AKI includes the treatment of any underlying cause, general medical management of kidney failure and, if necessary, renal replacement therapy (dialysis) . However, once ATN has developed, and in other causes of AKI, the patient will often be oliguric for several days or weeks . Patients with ATN lose the ability both to concentrate and dilute the urine, and will pass a constant volume with inappropriate osmolality . Although diuretics do not alter the course or outcome of AKI, high-dose diuretics may convert oliguric AKI to non-oliguric AKI, which is worthwhile if dialysis is not readily available . As many of the drugs prescribed for patients with AKI are excreted via the kidney, doses must be adjusted and drug levels monitored accordingly . As gastrointestinal hemorrhage is another potential cause of morbidity in AKI, prophylactic treatment to reduce acid secretion is generally indicated . In oliguric or anuric patients, the fluid intake required for feeding generally means that dialysis will be necessary (Table 3.5) . Specific treatments . Most patients with ATN should recover kidney function, provided that they survive the underlying illness . However, increasingly it is being recognized that AKI is a risk factor for the subsequent development of CKD . Similarly, most patients will recover from acute interstitial nephritis . Survival in AKI depends on the cause, and mortality remains high (40-80%) in patients with multiple organ failure . Death is likely if AKI is associated with failure of more than three other organ systems . In patients acquiring AKI in the community, however, mortality is much lower (10-30%) . ","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and often reversible if diagnosed promptly. Recognition and management of volume depletion or overload is crucial in the early management of AKI. Patients require frequent re-assessment and measurement of physiological parameters (including urine output), and daily measurement of serum electrolytes. Drug doses often need to be modified. Acute tubular necrosis has no specific treatment other than volume control, and there is no benefit in the routine use of dopamine or furosemide. AKI is a risk factor for the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease."
9781910797150,ch04,"It is essential that oncologists and oncology practitioners take significant time and effort to prepare patients adequately for their first course of chemotherapy . Clinicians have a wide variety of antiemetics to choose from for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and patients should receive the most effective antiemetic agents available . Outcomes are improved by following the recommendations of national or international guidelines for CINV . If antiemetic therapy is used correctly, CINV can be prevented in up to 70-75% of patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and up to 80% receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) . If the patient has a high level of anxiety before the first course of chemotherapy, serious consideration should be given to adding an antianxiety agent to the antiemetic regimen . Antiemetic therapy should be started before chemotherapy is administered on day 1 and continued through the acute and delayed phase for as long as the chemotherapy is emetic (usually 2-3 days) . The route of delivery will depend on what the patient is best able to tolerate . In general, antiemetics given either orally or intravenously in appropriate doses have equivalent efficacy . If CINV can be prevented after the first course of chemotherapy, it is likely that subsequent courses of chemotherapy will be well tolerated and breakthrough, refractory and anticipatory CINV will be minimized . Highly emetogenic chemotherapy . The recommended doses for these agents are shown in Table 4.3 . Women with breast cancer receiving AC chemotherapy have a particularly high risk of CINV and are included in these recommendations . Choice of antiemetic agent . These recommendations should be based on cost, efficacy and toxicity . Choice of 5-HT RA . All patients in both arms received standard doses of dexamethasone . Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy . Prophylactic control of carboplatin-based CINV requires a triple-drug combination of a NK-1 RA, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone before chemotherapy is administered on day 1 . If aprepitant, 125 mg, is used on day 1, aprepitant, 80 mg, is recommended on days 2-3 for the prevention of delayed CINV . At present there is no consensus as to whether to administer dexamethasone on days 2-3 . Some clinicians add 2 days of aprepitant to the regimen after completion of multiple-day chemotherapy to control the delayed nausea and vomiting that may occur after the final day of chemotherapy . There are no data for rolapitant or netupitant in patients receiving multiple-day cisplatin treatment, and the optimal doses of 5-HT RA and dexamethasone have yet to be determined . Furthermore, the 20-mg dose of dexamethasone that is often used on each day of chemotherapy has only been studied in patients receiving single-day higher doses of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (>= 50 mg/m) . It is not known whether a lower dexamethasone dose administered on days 1-5 would be equivalent to a 20-mg dose . Low or minimally emetogenic chemotherapy . Limited evidence from clinical studies support the choice of antiemetic therapy or of any treatment at all for patients receiving low or minimally emetogenic chemotherapy . Of the patients who receive low or minimally emetogenic chemotherapy, it is hard to categorize those at risk of developing nausea and vomiting . High-dose chemotherapy . Although the natural history of CINV in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation is, for the most part, unknown, most of these patients have experienced emesis with previous chemotherapy or irradiation . Until recently, only phase II studies of antiemetic treatment with a 5-HT RA alone or combined with dexamethasone had been carried out in these patients . In recent years, phase III studies have been published that investigated the use of modern triple-antiemetic therapy consisting of a 5-HT RA, dexamethasone and aprepitant . In a phase III study, 179 patients were randomized to receive ondansetron and dexamethasone with or without aprepitant on each day of the high-dose preparative regimen . A total of 362 patients were available for the efficacy analysis, with 181 in each treatment arm . CINV in children . ","The primary goal of CINV therapy is the prevention of nausea and vomiting. Patients should be individually evaluated for their specific risk factors as well as the level of anxiety present before the first course of treatment. Outcomes are improved by following international guidelines when selecting the antiemetic regimen to use in relation to emetogenicity of the type of chemotherapy involved. The triple-drug regimen of a NK-1 receptor antagonist (RA), 5-HT RA and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The two-drug combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone before chemotherapy is recommended for patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy; no antiemetic should be administered routinely for patients receiving minimally emetogenic chemotherapy. The final choice of antiemetic agent will depend on efficacy, toxicity and cost. To determine overall cost-effectiveness of any given regimen, the acquisition cost of the antiemetic agent should be weighed against the probability and cost of post-chemotherapy visits to the clinic or emergency department and/or admissions to hospital. The incidence and severity of CINV in children is similar ito that in adults. The use of antiemetics in children should follow the same principles as those used to treat adults."
9781910797662,ch01,"An estimated 541 000 new cases of bladder cancer occurred globally in 2016, with 188 000 deaths . In the UK, approximately 10 100 new cases were diagnosed in 2014, accounting for 3% of all new cancer cases; bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the UK . The estimated annual incidence of bladder cancer in the USA in 2018 is expected to be 81 190, with 17 240 deaths . Bladder cancer is more common in men than women, with a male-to-female incidence ratio of 4:1, although the incidence among women appears to be rising . Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men in the USA . Incidence increases with age, with a median age at presentation of over 75 years in the UK . Most cases of bladder cancer are non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancers, which can usually be cured; the 5-year survival rate for these cancers is more than 95% . However, invasive or metastatic bladder cancer is a frequent cause of cancer death, accounting for approximately 17 000 deaths annually in the USA and 188 000 globally . Age-standardized death rates for bladder cancer are 5.1 per 100 000 person-years in men and 1.5 per 100 000 person-years in women . Globally, bladder cancer is responsible for over 3 million disability-adjusted life-years, mainly years of life lost due to advanced disease . Some data suggest that the global impact of bladder cancer is decreasing, even though incidence continues to rise, with a 9.6% decrease in the age-standardized rate for years of life lost between 2005 and 2015 . Many of these are avoidable, and as a result, many cases of bladder cancer could be prevented . Cigarette smoking is a major contributor to bladder carcinogenesis: 60-80% of patients with bladder cancer have a history of cigarette smoking and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 2-5-fold . Cigar and pipe tobacco smoking are also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, although the effect size seems to be less than with cigarettes . No clear increase in the risk of bladder cancer has been reported in marijuana smokers . One cohort study suggested an inverse association, although a causal effect has not been established . Occupational risks . The strongest association between occupation and bladder cancer has been identified in workers of aniline dyes who are exposed to aromatic amines . Other occupations associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer due to carcinogen exposure are listed in Table 1.2 . Occupational risks have been reviewed by Rushton et al . Dietary factors . The importance of dietary factors in the etiology of bladder cancer remains unclear . Caffeine has long been thought to be implicated in bladder cancer but the effects of confounding factors have been difficult to untangle . A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies concluded that coffee consumption was associated with a 33% increase in the odds ratio for development of bladder cancer, and the argument was strengthened by the finding that bladder cancer risk was increased in non-smoking coffee drinkers . Current consensus is that normal doses of caffeine are not bladder carcinogenic . Various artificial sweeteners have been implicated as risk factors for bladder cancer but subsequent research has failed to confirm such links; the US Food and Drug Administration does not list any restrictions for artificial sweeteners with respect to bladder cancer risk . Long-term ingestion of drinking water contaminated with nitrate derived from fertilizers or human or animal waste has been linked with an increased risk of bladder cancer in postmenopausal women . A dose-response relationship is evident: cumulative doses above 20 g increase the risk 6-fold, and doses of 50 g or more increase the risk by 14.5-fold . Latency is relatively short - the time between exposure and subsequent bladder cancer diagnosis is 6-13 years . The risk of subsequent bladder cancer can be reduced in the oncology setting by minimizing the cumulative dose, although this is not always feasible . Pelvic irradiation for conditions such as cervical cancer has been linked to a 4-fold increase in the risk of bladder cancer . Chronic infection or inflammation due to indwelling suprapubic or Foley catheters in patients with spinal cord injury and other conditions has been linked to an increased incidence of bladder cancer, especially squamous cell cancer . Chronic kidney stones may also lead to chronic inflammation and an increased risk of bladder cancer . Most bladder cancers related to schistosomiasis have squamous cell histology although urothelial cancers also occur . ","Bladder cancer is a common tumor; each year approximately 17 000 people in the USA die from the disease, and 188 000 globally. Bladder cancer incidence has a male-to-female ratio of 4:1. The incidence increases with age, with a median age at presentation of 60-65 years. Bladder cancer has many etiological risk factors, most of which are avoidable; the most common cause is cigarette smoking. Some familial syndromes and genetic predispositions increase the risk of bladder cancer."
9781910797105,ch02,"The status of schizophrenia as a disease has been much debated . Strictly speaking, schizophrenia is a syndrome - a disorder for which there is no objective test or pathology, but which is identified by a characteristic cluster of symptoms that last for a certain time . Core symptoms . A large number of studies have found that the symptoms of schizophrenia usually segregate into three semi-independent symptom complexes (Table 2.1) . Positive symptoms include hallucinations, defined as perceptions in the absence of an external stimulus, and delusions, defined as unshakable false beliefs not explainable by religious or cultural background . In the 1930s, the German psychiatrist Kurt Schneider reviewed many case records and listed eight symptoms that he considered diagnostic of schizophrenia . Negative symptoms . The presence and severity of negative symptoms are more critical to the prognosis than hallucinations and delusions . Negative symptoms often persist to some degree even when positive symptoms have improved . It is important to distinguish between primary and enduring negative symptoms or deficit symptoms, which are indisputably part of the illness, and secondary negative symptoms . Behavioral disorganization - the third symptom complex - refers to a disruption in the associations among mood, thought and behavior . Affective symptoms, including symptoms of anxiety, depression and mania, may occur in addition to the three symptom complexes . Diagnostic classification systems . The loosening of the diagnostic boundaries in schizophrenia became a concern in the early 1970s . This approach gives a menu of possible symptoms and specifies that a certain number should be present for a minimum duration before a diagnosis can be made . Current classification systems . In their definitions of schizophrenia, the two systems are similar . The main differences are that the DSM-5 states a minimum duration of symptoms, including prodromal symptoms, of 6 months, and includes deterioration of social functioning, whereas the ICD-10 specifies just 1 month of symptoms . A classification of an acute form of schizophrenia in the ICD-10 is equivalent to a classification of schizophreniform disorder in the DSM-5 . First, a raised symptom threshold, so that two specified symptoms are needed instead of just one . Research Domain Criteria: a systems-based approach . The five identified domains of interest are . Negative valence systems . Positive valence systems . Cognitive systems . Systems for social processes . Arousal and regulatory systems . Rating scales . The use of structured rating scales to assess symptoms and function allows us to track clinical change over time and to assess outcome . It is an increasingly important function in service and treatment evaluation . Outcome of schizophrenia can be measured in terms of severity of symptoms, cognitive function or social outcome, or by related constructs such as quality of life or patient satisfaction (Table 2.6) . Measurable dimensions of outcome and the most widely used rating scales used to make these assessments are detailed below . The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is now the most widely used of the symptom rating scales (Table 2.7) . It comprises 30 items in three subscales that rate positive, negative and general symptoms, respectively . Alternatively, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Scales for the Assessment of Positive/Negative Symptoms (SAPS/SANS) may be used to track changes in positive, negative and general symptoms . The Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) is specifically designed to assess depressive symptoms in people with schizophrenia, and has been shown to be reliable and to have good construct validity . Social functioning is a less frequently measured, but very important, outcome . The Social Functioning Scale is probably the best instrument, although is not greatly sensitive to change . Global functioning can be estimated very simply using the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) . Quality of life is an increasingly important concept, but the best way of measuring it is controversial . The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is probably the most widely used schizophrenia-specific scale . Cognitive function . The assessment of cognitive function and capacity has become increasingly important with the increased recognition of the role that cognitive impairments play in poor outcome . The Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) is an interview-based assessment of cognitive function . The UCSD Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA) is a performance-based assessment of cognitive capacity, in which patients are asked to perform standardized role-play situations . ","There are three major symptom clusters: positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms and behavioral disorganization. Cognitive impairments and negative symptoms have the greatest prognostic importance for functional outcome. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) provide the two principal diagnostic systems used to diagnose people with schizophrenia. It is important to rate social and functional outcomes, as well as symptoms."
9781908541420,ch_8,"Asthma exacerbations remain one of the major causes of morbidity in asthma . Fear of acute severe asthma is a major burden for many who live with severe asthma, and is a further reason for taking steps to prevent severe attacks . Any patient with asthma can suffer from an acute asthma episode, often described as an asthma attack . Inhalation of small allergen particles into the lower respiratory tract can cause a severe asthma episode and weather patterns can lead to epidemics of asthma in such circumstances . Similarly, severe food allergies (exempli gratia to peanuts or shellfish) may trigger asthma . Some medications, such as beta-blockers - even in eye drops - may also be responsible for an acute exacerbation of asthma . NSAID reactions are most often described in individuals with non-allergic asthma who have nasal polyposis . Regular use of controller asthma medication substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of an acute asthma attack . Asthma exacerbations may occur in individuals with asthma who do not receive adequate controller treatment . Recognizing a severe attack . It is important for patients and clinicians alike to recognize the signs of a severe asthma attack and know when to seek further help . Patients can recognize a severe asthma attack by the frequency and severity of symptoms (Figure 6.1) . Asthma symptoms that recur and require bronchodilator treatment more frequently than once every 4 hours are an indication of an attack that requires medical treatment . Most often, patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma describe their asthma as being 'out of control' . Patients may also monitor their peak expiratory flow (PEF) . Clinicians should assess the severity of an acute attack of asthma according to Table 6.1 . It is important to remember that asthma severity is classified according to the worst parameter . Management by the patient . Less severe asthma attacks are diagnosed by frequent requirement for bronchodilator (up to once every 4 hours), night waking with asthma and breathlessness . For those with more severe asthma, prompt access to a supply of oral corticosteroids is important to prevent severe exacerbations, and such patients may keep a store of these medications at home . Hospital referral . Hospital referral is indicated for all patients who have persisting severe asthma or symptoms despite oral corticosteroid therapy and for those in whom asthma is severe (see Figure 6.1) . Patients with a history of severe or brittle (unpredictable and severe) asthma, intensive care admission, difficulties in accessing care or psychosocial problems may require hospital referral at an earlier stage . Admission to hospital enables the administration of parenteral asthma therapy and observation of a patient with severe airflow obstruction to ensure there is a response to asthma treatment, thereby ensuring patient safety . Most deaths of people with asthma occur out of hospital, usually in those with severe chronic asthma but also in some considered to have mild asthma . Treatment with bronchodilator medication in the absence of controller (preventer) treatments or overuse of bronchodilator medication is a particular risk factor for fatal asthma . Individuals with these features should be observed carefully and may require early referral to hospital . All patients who have been admitted to hospital with asthma should see a respiratory specialist . Those with life-threatening or brittle asthma should remain under the care of a specialist . Treatment of acute severe asthma in hospital . Treatment of an acute exacerbation is based on the initial assessment of severity . The principles of acute asthma management in the emergency department are outlined in Figure 6.2 . Patients not responding to treatment and stable within 2 hours should be considered for admission to hospital . In hospital . Acute asthma management in hospital is summarized in Figure 6.3 . Once a patient is admitted to hospital, monitoring and treatment should continue with . Ongoing review in hospital ensures recovery and introduces patients to their ongoing preventative medication and the management plan likely to be required following a hospital admission for asthma . The time in hospital presents an ideal opportunity for formal asthma education; interventions that provide in-hospital asthma education have shown benefits in terms of reduced re-admission rates . All patients should leave hospital with medication, a written plan of what to do if their asthma worsens and a follow-up medical appointment for ongoing management . It is important that asthma control is assessed following a hospital admission and that ongoing maintenance medication is adjusted accordingly . ","Asthma exacerbations are one of the major causes of morbidity in asthma, resulting in loss of work time in adults or school absence in children, and emergency hospital presentation and admission. Causes of acute asthma include viral respiratory infections, acute allergen exposure, food allergies and some medications such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Acute exacerbations of asthma usually respond well to inhaled beta -agonists and a course of oral corticosteroid. After hospital admission, patients should receive appropriate medication, a written plan of what to do if their asthma worsens and a follow-up medical appointment for ongoing management and measurement of lung function."
9781910797297,chp2,"Primary cutaneous lymphomas are defined as lymphomas without evidence of extracutaneous spread . They can be divided into primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and B-cell cutaneous lymphoma . CTCL are a rare group of T-cell malignancies primarily involving the skin . Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) is the term used when the patient presents with follicular lesions, id est patches, plaques or tumors with follicular accentuation (Figures 2.14 and 2.15) . These folliculotropic lesions may present with cysts, comedones (Figure 2.16) or milia (Figure 2.17), often with a predilection for the head and neck . Folliculotropic MF may present with lesions limited to patches of MF showing follicular accentuation +/− alopecia, +/− cysts, or with thick plaques and/or tumors with follicular accentuation often showing a predilection to the head and neck . Patients with lesions limited to follicular patches may have a similar prognosis to classical MF whilst those with dense follicular plaques have a poorer prognosis similar to those with advanced tumor stage classical MF . Pagetoid reticulosis is a variant of MF that presents as a solitary patch or plaque, usually located on the extremities and acral sites . Granulomatous slack skin is a subtype of MF that presents with redundant folds of skin, typically in the flexor sites . Early disease . Early lesions may resolve when exposed to sunlight . Because of the difficulty in diagnosing MF, patients are often treated for eczema or psoriasis for months to years before the correct diagnosis is made . Hypopigmented MF is more common in children and black skin, and the malignant T cells are more frequently CD8+ . In addition to the physical disfiguration associated with these skin lesions, patients with MF experience itching (pruritus) and pain, which generally worsens in more advanced disease, all of which has a negative effect on quality of life . About 25% of patients will progress to advanced disease, with survival of 10-25 years . Advanced disease . About 30% of patients with MF develop tumors (Figures 2.6 - 2.11) or erythroderma (Figures 2.12 and 2.13) . Sézary syndrome (SS) is a form of CTCL that presents as advanced disease with erythroderma (Figure 2.19), lymphadenopathy and peripheral blood involvement . This leukemic form of CTCL is typically aggressive with a median survival of just 3 years . Patients experience extreme pruritus and often succumb to infection . Ectropion is a common finding in these patients as well . Other less common variants of indolent primary CTCL . Primary cutaneous anaplastic CD30+ large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) presents with rapidly enlarging skin tumors, often with central necrosis (Figure 2.22) . Systemic spread rarely occurs, but relapses in the skin are common . It most commonly presents as erythroderma, widespread papules and plaques and papular erythroderma . SPTCL is an indolent disease that is confined to the subcutis, presenting as solitary or multiple nodules and plaques . Although skin recurrences frequently occur, extracutaneous spread is rare . Primary cutaneous gammaδ T-cell lymphoma has an aggressive clinical course, usually with systemic spread, and may be complicated by a hemophagocytic syndrome . Systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue and weight loss may be present . Other CTCL variants are included within the WHO/EORTC cutaneous lymphoma classification . It usually presents as a destructive midfacial tumor or as multiple plaques or tumors with ulceration on the trunk or extremities . Systemic symptoms and a hemophagocytic syndrome may be present . Early-stage lesions may be misdiagnosed as common dermatoses or fungal infections, such as . MF should be suspected if lesions do not respond to conventional treatment . Most forms of cutaneous lymphoma have a nodal counterpart: systemic nodal lymphomas may involve the skin during the disease course and, on occasions, may present with skin involvement . ","Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a rare group of lymphomas that affect the skin. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the commonest type of CTCL and typically presents in the early stages with patches and plaques. Early-stage MF may progress to advanced disease with skin tumors and blood involvement, with lymph node or visceral spread. Some patients (30%) present with advanced disease. Early-stage MF has an excellent prognosis and long survival (10+ years), whilst the advanced stages are rapidly progressive in 1-4 years. Sézary syndrome is the erythrodermic form of CTCL that presents in advanced disease with leukemic blood involvement. Cutaneous lymphomas may be CD30+, and this group forms a spectrum from lymphomatoid papulosis with relapsing and remitting lesions to large cell anaplastic lymphomas that may grow rapidly. These types of CTCL have an excellent prognosis and should be differentiated from transformed MF, which also has large atypical CD30+ cells. Other forms of CTCL are rare and include subcutaneous panniculitis-like lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder."
9781910797006,ch06,"Smoking cessation is therefore the single most important therapeutic intervention . It is important that smokers are informed that these cravings will subside with or without relapse to smoking . There is evidence that smokers differ in their biological propensity to become smokers and that genetic factors may affect their ability to quit . Therapeutic interventions targeted at individual smokers' susceptibilities are under intensive investigation . Available therapies can nevertheless help a substantial minority of smokers to quit . Despite this, only 2% of smokers successfully quit spontaneously in a year . Simple physician advice to quit can increase these rates to 5-6% . Additional non-pharmacological support, which can include behavioral, cognitive and motivational support, and pharmacological therapy can further increase quit rates . These steps ensure that smokers receive maximum encouragement to quit . Intensive interventions are appropriate for many patients with COPD . Each practitioner caring for patients with COPD should have the option of referring patients for intensive intervention . System approaches ensure smoking cessation intervention is integrated into each practice and is fully supported by the healthcare system . Brief interventions . Brief interventions can be highly effective for many smokers . Smokers not yet ready to quit should be provided with a brief intervention to increase motivation . Many smokers, however, will not attend intensive behavioral programs . The efficacy of widely available telephone quit lines has been well demonstrated . However, many of these do not have supporting evidence . Pharmacological treatment . All smokers making a serious attempt to quit should be offered pharmacological treatment (in the absence of contraindications) . Treatment with first-line medicines for smoking cessation can double or triple quit rates compared with those achieved without pharmacological support . Second-line treatments should be considered for smokers who have failed first-line treatment . First-line treatments for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion (also known as amfebutamone) . Several other formulations are under investigation . This form of therapy has been in use the longest and many over-the-counter formulations are available . Many patients will therefore have had prior experience with these treatments . The use of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation is based on the pharmacokinetics of nicotine as a psychoactive drug . Currently available nicotine formulations provide only partial nicotine replacement for most smokers, and none completely prevents withdrawal symptoms, but they do reduce them . More importantly, nicotine replacement therapies increase quit rates . The general strategy for their use is to establish a quit day and to start nicotine replacement on that day . Therapy is then continued for 10 weeks to 6 months . Individual preferences for the various formulations allow the physician some choice in individualizing therapy . Because the available formulations generally provide incomplete nicotine replacement, combination therapy can be considered . It approximately doubles quit rates compared with placebo, and may be particularly effective in individuals with a history of depression . Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy can be used in combination . Bupropion is generally started 1 week before the quit day so that adequate blood levels can be achieved . The usual initial dose is 150 mg once a day and is increased to twice a day after 3 days if tolerated . This agent is available as an antidepressant and can therefore be used off-label for smoking cessation by physicians comfortable with its use . Electronic cigarettes and other recreational nicotine products . There may be benefits for individual smokers who switch from cigarettes to such products, but this is not demonstrated . For this reason, smokers interested in combustible tobacco use cessation should be offered approved modalities (exempli gratia nicotine replacement therapy, nicotinic receptor agonists) . Follow-up evaluations . Success in smoking cessation is closely linked to follow-up . All smokers making a serious attempt to quit should therefore be offered follow-up assessment . Follow-up 1-2 weeks after the quit day is generally recommended . Intensive interventions . Intensive interventions are more elaborate than the brief interventions described above . Only a minority of smokers referred for intensive programs will attend . Such programs can, however, provide important support for many smokers, and every practitioner should be able to refer patients for intensive intervention . The healthcare system should also provide adequate support for smoking cessation efforts and personnel at all levels should be active participants in smoking cessation interventions . Data show that quit rates increase when more personnel at more levels participate in smoking cessation therapy . ","Smoking should be regarded as a primary chronic relapsing disease. All serious attempts to quit should be maximally supported with behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Repeated efforts by the physician are required to provide sufficient motivation for a quit attempt. Relapses are common, and should engender repeated attempts. Smoking cessation activities should be an integrated part of every medical practice."
9781910797181,ch02,"The prevalence of cigarette smoking varies from country to country, as do rates for men and women (Figure 2.1) . In countries such as the UK and the USA, rates are relatively low overall, and rates for women are slightly lower than those for men . However, in Asian and African countries the prevalence of smoking is much higher in men than in women . Within countries, smoking prevalence varies according to socioeconomic status and level of education . In high-income countries such as the UK and the USA, smoking rates are higher among less affluent and less well-educated groups . In the UK, the main cause of the socioeconomic gradient in smoking prevalence is a difference in the success of attempts to stop smoking . In other countries, different patterns may hold true . Ethnic differences in smoking prevalence are often accompanied by sex differences . In the UK, there is also a high prevalence of smoking in people of African-Caribbean descent . In the USA, native American communities have particularly high smoking rates (Figure 2.3) . Changes in smoking prevalence . At that time, most of the population smoked, whereas prevalence is now 20-30% . Figure 2.4 shows the decrease in smoking in men and women in Japan, the UK and the USA since the 1960s . It is widely thought that it will become increasingly difficult to reduce smoking prevalence in countries such as the USA and UK as the persisting smokers will be more 'hard core' . Moreover, as the prevalence of smoking has dropped, so has the daily cigarette consumption of the remaining smokers . The commonly held view in the UK and the USA that women are more likely to smoke than men is unfounded . Not only do men continue to be more likely to smoke than women, but the difference is larger than it appears, because pipes and cigars, which are smoked almost exclusively by men, are not included in these figures - these would add about 2% to smoking prevalence in men . In addition, male smokers tend to smoke more heavily than female smokers . For example, prevalence seems to be rising in some countries in Eastern Europe . France has pulled back from strong anti-tobacco policies and this has been reflected by an increase in smoking rates . Daily smoking patterns . The majority of smokers smoke every day . In England, just under 90% of smokers smoke daily . In the USA, the proportion of non-daily smokers has increased to around 25%, and is highest in states with the lowest smoking prevalence and most active tobacco control policies . The application of regulations that prevent smoking in indoor public areas may partly account for this increase, but there are probably other factors as well, including the changing social acceptability of smoking . It should be noted that non-daily smokers do take in substantial amounts of nicotine - and probably, therefore, tobacco-related toxins from smoking . Further, non-daily smoking confers substantial health risks, especially from cardiovascular diseases . It is therefore misleading to report only daily smoking in the headline prevalence figures as is done in some countries such as Australia . Starting to smoke . In the USA and the UK, people most commonly start smoking at 13-16 years of age . The reasons why young people become smokers are complex . There is also evidence that children who suffer from depression are more likely to begin smoking, but the reverse is also true - non-depressed children who start to smoke are more likely to become depressed subsequently . Evidence on the influence of parental smoking is not as clear as one might expect . Some research has suggested that the influence is not one of direct role models, but may be related to a permissive attitude to smoking . However, there is also evidence that becoming a regular smoker is linked to a genetic susceptibility . The heritability of take-up of regular smoking in western countries has been put at around 50% . Attitudes to smoking and beliefs about the risks and benefits of smoking are quite closely linked to smoking behavior in young people, but, interestingly, are not particularly useful as predictors of smoking uptake . Smokers' attitudes and attempts to stop smoking . Other forms of tobacco use . Although the focus of this book is on cigarette smoking, it must be remembered that pipe and cigar smoking present similar health risks if the smoke is inhaled . In both the USA and the UK about 2% of men smoke pipes or cigars, but not cigarettes . Although the health risks from smokeless tobacco are substantially lower than those from smoking, they may nevertheless be significant . ","Smoking prevalence varies across countries from less than 20% to more than 60% in men, and from less than 5% to more than 30% in women. Smoking prevalence is higher in men than in women in almost every country. In industrialized English-speaking countries (which have all implemented tobacco control measures), smoking prevalence has declined markedly, and in countries such as the UK and Australia with strong anti-tobacco policies it continues to decline. In western industrialized countries, smoking prevalence is greater among people with lower educational level and greater socioeconomic disadvantage. Most smokers smoke every day, and in the USA and the UK 70% smoke within 30 minutes of waking. Most smokers start during adolescence; initial take-up and transition to regular smoking are linked to both genetic and social factors. In most developed countries, most smokers want to stop smoking, usually because of health concerns and cost, and try to do so many times."
9781908541727,ch01,"You only have a few minutes with each patient who comes to see you with an eye complaint, and (if you're a general practitioner) you probably have very little eye examination equipment . A careful history of the patient's eye symptoms plus looking for a few critical signs of serious disease will help you identify how urgently the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist, or whether you can treat them yourself . Always remember to examine both eyes . Eye anatomy . Taking a history . Do you have any other eye symptoms, for example, pain, sensitivity to light, flashes or floaters? . You will then need to ask about . the patient's ophthalmic history . the patient's medical and surgical history . any family history of eye problems . If something hit the eye, find out what it was and with what velocity it struck the eye . Tracking symptom development . A patient who has recently had eye surgery and presents with a red eye or blurred vision obviously needs urgent referral . Patients with a more remote history of eye disease or surgery are also more likely to develop problems in the future . Patients with a history of cold sores also have an increased risk of corneal ulcers . Patients with hypertension or carotid stenosis may develop a retinal vascular occlusion . Patients with Graves' disease can develop proptosis and double vision from swelling of the extraocular muscles . Eyelid and eye surface examination . White light . Examine the eyes and eyelids with a flashlight and, if you have one, a magnifier (Figure 1.5a) . Are the eyes red? . Eyelid examination . Intraocular pressure testing . There are various methods of testing intraocular pressure; instruments that measure eye pressure are called tonometers . If there is a very high eye pressure in one eye (as in acute glaucoma) you can compare how both eyes 'feel' by gently pressing on the eyes through closed lids; in acute glaucoma the affected eye feels hard . The drops should not be used in patients with acute neurological problems . Set the lens wheel on '0', stand 1 m (3 ft) away from the patient in a dark room, look through the ophthalmoscope at the patient's eyes and ask them to look at the ophthalmoscope light . View as much of the peripheral retina as possible by asking the patient to look up, down, right and left in turn . Finally, ask the patient to look directly at the light to view the macula . Slit-lamp examination is required to determine whether an eye is definitely 'normal' . There are many eye diseases, for example iritis, which can only be diagnosed with the slit lamp . When performing a basic eye examination you will need to assess . visual field . eye movements (if the patient has a 'turned eye' or double vision) . eye surface . If the patient cannot even see the largest letter on the chart, check whether they can . For example, a patient with a pituitary tumor can have a bitemporal hemianopia but still retain normal VA in each eye . To test the patient's right visual field to confrontation, sit directly in front of the patient and close your right eye (by shutting your eyelid, not by putting your hand over your eye) . Ask the patient, however, to cover their left eye with their left hand and stare into your left eye . You now have two hands available to test two of the four visual field quadrants of the patient's right eye at the same time . Ensure that you can see your fingers too, while staring at the patient's right eye . Ask the patient how many fingers in total you are holding up . Then repeat the procedure on the patient's left eye . There are many other tests for visual field, such as gradually bringing in a target from the periphery and asking the patient to tell you when they see it . Eye movements should be tested in patients who complain of double vision, or in children who present with a squint ('turned eye') . This should be performed for all patients complaining of blurred vision, flashes, floaters or visual field loss . A normal response is for each pupil to constrict when the light is shone on each eye in turn . ","Eye disease cannot be accurately diagnosed without a slit-lamp microscope examination. If in any doubt, refer the patient. Carry out a basic eye assessment by:- identifying the presenting symptoms- taking a complete patient history- performing as thorough an examination as you can with the equipment you have available. Test visual acuity (VA) in every patient who complains of blurred vision. Test the visual field to confrontation to detect disease that would be missed by testing for VA alone. Perform the 'swinging light test' to check for a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in all patients who complain of blurred vision, flashes, floaters or visual field loss. The presence of an RAPD signifies serious retinal or optic nerve disease. In patients with red eye/s, the use of a blue light and fluorescein drops may identify a corneal ulcer that is invisible with white light alone. Although useful for viewing the optic disc, the commonly available handheld direct ophthalmoscope is not a particularly good instrument for examining the retina. Patients who exhibit 'normal fundoscopy' with the direct ophthalmoscope can still have serious disease that is detectable only by examination with the slit-lamp microscope and retinal lenses. Use your patients' eye symptoms and signs to triage them according to their need for referral to an ophthalmologist: those with serious eye emergencies who require urgent referral, those with non-urgent problems who require routine referral and those whom you can observe or treat yourself. - identifying the presenting symptoms - taking a complete patient history - performing as thorough an examination as you can with the equipment you have available."
9781910797433,ch01,"The incidence of ovarian cancer varies markedly around the world: typically, the highest rates are seen in non-Hispanic white women, followed by Hispanic, African and Asian women (Figure 1.1) . In the UK, there were 7378 new cases of ovarian cancer in 2014, accounting for 2% of all new cancer cases . Ovarian cancer accounted for an estimated 152 000 deaths worldwide in 2012 . In the UK, approximately 4100 women died as a result of ovarian cancer in 2014, making it the fifth most common cause of cancer death among women . In the USA, it is anticipated that ovarian cancer will account for approximately 14 080 deaths in 2017 . Survival rates in ovarian cancer are the lowest of any gynecologic malignancy . Risk factors . The incidence of ovarian cancer begins to increase in women over 30-34 years of age, with the highest rates in women aged 65-69 years (Figure 1.2) . In the UK, 53% of cases diagnosed between 2012 and 2014 were in women aged 65 years or older . The risk of ovarian cancer is approximately threefold higher in women with a first-degree relative (id est mother or sister) affected by ovarian cancer: indeed, a positive family history is the strongest known risk factor for ovarian cancer, even though 40% of patients with BRCA1- or BRCA2- related ovarian cancer have a negative family history . Furthermore, as noted above, the incidence of ovarian cancer varies markedly between ethnic groups . These findings clearly demonstrate the importance of genetic factors in ovarian cancer . However, it is estimated that the genetic risk factors known at present account for less than half of the excess familial risk of ovarian cancer . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the strongest known genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer, accounting for around 65-85% of all cases of hereditary ovarian cancers . The cumulative lifetime ovarian cancer risk associated with these genes is 40-50% for BRCA1 and 20-30% for BRCA2 . Mismatch repair genes . Inherited mutations in mismatch repair genes are associated with an estimated cumulative risk of ovarian cancer of 6-12% . These genes account for 10-15% of hereditary ovarian cancers . Other genes implicated in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer include . Reproductive factors . In general, factors that decrease the number of ovulatory cycles reduce the risk of ovarian cancer . Oral contraceptive use . In a landmark analysis of 45 epidemiological studies, the use of oral contraceptives was associated with proportional reductions in the risk of ovarian cancer of 15-29% over 5 years . Breast-feeding . Several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that breast-feeding reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 24-37%, and that the protective effect increases with the duration of breast-feeding . Smoking was associated with an increased risk of mucinous cancers, but this was largely offset by a reduced risk of endometrioid cancers (see Chapter 2) . Recognition of the importance of genetic and hormonal factors in the development of ovarian cancer has led to potential strategies for prevention of the disease . Despite the well-established genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer, no validated population-based screening programs exist . Close surveillance is recommended for women at high risk of the disease, especially those with BRCA mutations . To date, the principal approaches to ovarian cancer screening have been the use of circulating biomarkers and ultrasound visualization of the ovaries . Major trials of ovarian cancer screening . After a median follow-up of 11.1 years, ovarian cancer had been diagnosed in 1282 women (0.6%) . The participating women underwent ROCA-based screening every 4 months . Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy was encouraged throughout the study . Within a median follow-up period of 4.8 years, 4348 women underwent 13 728 women-years of screening . The study established ROCA-based screening as an option for women at high risk of ovarian cancer who defer or decline risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, given its high sensitivity and significant stage shift . However, whether this strategy would improve survival in screened high-risk women has yet to be proven . Participants were followed for up to 13 years . On the basis of these results, the US Preventative Services Task Force concluded that ovarian cancer screening should not be offered to women at low risk of the disease . ","Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, and a leading cause of cancer death among women. The highest incidence rates are seen in non-Hispanic white women, and the lowest in African or Asian women. Survival rates in ovarian cancer are the lowest of any gynecologic malignancy, largely because the majority of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are the most important genetic factors contributing to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the genetic risk factors known at present account for less than half of the excess risk of the disease. Oral contraceptive use is strongly protective against ovarian cancer. Risk-reducing surgery (salpingo-oophorectomy) is recommended for high-risk women up to the age of 45 years. To date, large screening trials based on CA125 measurement and transvaginal ultrasound have failed to show any significant benefits in terms of reducing deaths from ovarian cancer."
9783318067095,ch2,"Within the clinical space . Clinical care is familiar to most readers from their own experiences with doctors, hospitals and other parts of the healthcare system . Historically, its primary purpose has been to address health problems, and it has long been grounded in the interaction between a patient and a healthcare provider . There has been varying progression of healthcare activities toward preventive care and the maintenance of wellness . With the introduction of connected technologies, there have also been attempts to move healthcare activities into the home, decreasing the need for face-to-face interactions with providers . Clinical care activities include a wide range of diagnostic and treatment processes and procedures, such as . real-time monitoring - for example, with continuous blood glucose sensors . tools to support medical adherence, such as smart apps and pill dispensers . physical rehabilitation tools, such as digital activity trackers . Clinical research may include some of the same activities as clinical care, but the primary purpose of clinical research is to develop a better understanding of factors influencing health and illness in people . The federal regulations define research as a 'systematic investigation, including research development, testing and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge' . When a person (exempli gratia patient or healthy individual) volunteers to enroll in clinical research, they are called a research participant . There are rules and guidance that must be followed when conducting clinical research to make sure that research participants are protected from undue risks of harm . Clinical research comes in two broad subsets . In interventional studies, participants receive some form of treatment, education or support (Box 2.1) . Clinical trials are a subset of interventional studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention . In non-interventional studies, participants do not receive an intervention . Non-interventional studies include observational, exploratory, survey, case-control, cohort and correlational studies . Computational studies that use existing data sources to build predictive models fall into this category . Outside the clinic walls . Like any other medical tool, at-home monitoring technologies need to prove their worth . Developers, working with researchers and other experts, must demonstrate that these tools produce clinically meaningful information that leads to clinically meaningful improvements in care, processes and outcomes . Digital measurement in medicine will not replace clinics or clinicians entirely, nor would we want them to . The delivery of, for example, intravenous drugs or surgery, and the value that patients place on their relationship with their provider, cannot be replaced by digital tools . Nonetheless, when used appropriately, digital measurements can improve care by giving clinicians more complete information . Also, transferring some practices out of the clinic and into patients' regular lives - for example, passively measuring sleep quality with wearables instead of requiring overnight stays in clinics - can enhance access to care and reduce cost . Continuous at-home monitoring also raises a new set of practical issues . who will monitor the data? . who will be responsible for acting on it if it indicates a need for action? . how will providers be compensated for these tasks? . Although organizations like the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) have made inroads in addressing the first two questions, the field will need to address these issues and adopt consensus solutions for these tools to be truly integrated into clinical care . A defining moment for any medical product, whether drug or device, is when the product goes to market . From this perspective, the industry splits into 'premarket' research activities, drug and device development in the life sciences and biotech, and 'postmarket' commercial activities, where the products are used in clinical applications like in the hospital . Often, government regulators like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) are the gatekeepers between what is considered research (premarket) and what is part of standard of care and commercial activities (postmarket) . National governments are responsible for establishing national medicines and medical device standards and regulatory authorities that determine what claims product manufacturers can make when they go to market in that country . As of 2015, 121 of the 194 members of the World Health Organization had a national regulatory authority responsible for implementing and enforcing product regulations specific to medical devices . For example, in the USA, the FDA serves this function . Across the Atlantic, this oversight is provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) . ","Digital medicine holds the promise of bringing complex medical measurements, observations and interventions outside the clinic. Clinical research uses include interventional and non-interventional trials, although many practicalities and data management issues are yet to become commodities. Regulation of digital medicine varies widely across the globe."
9781910797181,ch06,"Recording and using smoking as a vital sign . Smoking is linked to so many diseases that recording it is imperative in the diagnosis of a condition and in deciding its management . Failing to record smoking status and acting on the result is considered by leading professional organizations such as the UK's Royal College of Physicians and the American Medical Association to be tantamount to negligence . Smoking history is important in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . It can also be useful in the preliminary diagnosis of other smoking-related diseases and where a hidden psychiatric disorder is suspected . Advising patients to stop . It is now recognized that all clinicians have a role to play in encouraging and aiding smoking cessation . Research has shown that brief opportunistic advice from a physician can trigger an attempt to stop smoking in about 40% of cases . If the smoker then attempts to quit with no treatment, he or she has only a 5% chance of long-term success . Hence, the overall effect of the physician's advice alone (without assistance) is to create one long-term ex-smoker for about every 50 people advised . First of all, there may be a risk that repeatedly raising the subject of smoking with a patient may undermine the doctor-patient relationship, adversely affecting adherence to treatment regimens for other conditions and even causing a smoker to avoid seeing the doctor . Second, without effective treatment for nicotine dependence (see below), it is mostly less-dependent smokers who stop in response to brief advice from their physician . The more-dependent smokers are in greater need of stopping but are less likely to do so . Third, the law of diminishing returns appears to apply, so that smokers who have not responded to previous advice are less likely to respond the next time it is given . For these reasons, national and international professional guidelines suggest that physicians aim to raise the issue of smoking with patients known to be smokers at least once a year . The goal is to trigger a quit attempt in as many smokers as possible and to encourage as many smokers as possible to use effective treatments to help that quit attempt succeed . The first task is to check whether the smoker has already given up (Figure 6.1) . If not, then rather than berating the smoking or even advising the patient to stop, the evidence suggests that clinicians should just advise smokers that there are now effective methods to help with quitting and encourage the smoker to try one of these . If the smoker is not interested, the clinician simply closes the conversation by inviting the smoker to think about quitting and to get in touch if he or she changes his or her mind . Note that this is very different from the traditional approach of advising smokers to stop and then talking about different methods of stopping if they show an interest . It seems that better results are obtained and the interaction with the patient is more positive if the clinician simply advises all patients about the best ways of stopping if they want to and encourage them to use one of them . If the smoker expresses an interest in stopping, attention switches to enhancing the efficacy of the quit attempt through treatment . The clinician should refer the smoker to a trained stop-smoking specialist (whether in-person services or those offered via telephone) if one is available, as he or she will be able to provide the full range of help . This may require nothing more than providing the smoker with a card or leaflet showing the telephone number . Smokers should also be encouraged to use pharmacological treatment (discussed below) . If a trained specialist is not available but the physician is trained and can provide behavioral support, a schedule of appointments can be made to provide this help and support . If, however, the physician does not have the training or time to provide behavioral support, he or she should discuss appropriate medication and provide whatever help and support he or she can . When discussing medication with the patient, the clinician needs to recognize that many smokers have already tried nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline (Champix/Chantix) . Training in smoking cessation and knowledge of the effects of smoking . As well as having a vital role in encouraging smokers to stop, referring them to cessation treatment services and prescribing medication to aid the quit attempt, clinicians must also be aware of the wide range of interactions between smoking and the clinical conditions that they manage . Smoking is not covered particularly well in undergraduate or postgraduate medical education . Several useful resources are available to assist in educating clinicians about smoking . National guidelines are also available (see Key references) . ","Smoking is an essential vital sign; it is imperative that patients' smoking status be recorded and the record kept up to date. A physician's advice on smoking has a positive effect and need take as little as 30 seconds. The advice should focus, taking a small amount of time in routine consultations at least once a year, on telling all smokers about the best ways of stopping rather than berating smokers or just advising them to stop."
9781910797631,chp7,"The relationship between depression and medical illness appears strongest for conditions that are painful and disabling, prompting the possibility that these attributes of medical illness are the influential factors for the association . The prevalence of depression among a range of medically ill populations has been widely investigated, and this research shows rates of depression two- to threefold higher than among comparable groups of people not experiencing such diseases (Table 7.1) . The presence of depression together with medical illness has important implications for the individual, their carers and for health services and society . This increased risk remains after adjusting for confounding factors . Depression combined with medical illness causes greater disability than these conditions in isolation, and the extent of lost productivity and healthcare use is greatly increased when these conditions exist together . The association between depression and physical health problems could operate through several different pathways . Depression may predict and be a risk factor in the development of medical illness . Medical illness may predict and play a causal influence in the development of depression . The development of both depression and medical illness may relate to a shared cause or risk factor . Medical illness may present with depressive symptoms . Depression may be related to the effects of medical illness treatment or, vice versa, medical illness may relate to adverse effects of depression treatment . For example, a meta-analysis of relevant study findings has shown the link between depression and obesity to be reciprocal: obesity was found to increase the risk of depression, but also depression is predictive of developing obesity . Depression as a predictor of physical illness . Depression may increase the likelihood of developing certain medical conditions; evidence from longitudinal studies involving occupational and geographic cohorts shows clearly that a history of depression is linked to developing cardiovascular disease and to the onset of diabetes . Cohort studies conducted in the USA and Japan also show that depression is an independent risk factor for stroke . There is weaker evidence that links depression to the incidence of cancer and hypertension . There seem to be two main mechanisms involved in linking depression to later medical illness and to worsened outcomes from these illnesses, such as increased mortality . Physical illness predicting depression . The most intuitively plausible link between physical illness and depression is that the stresses, role limitations and pain related to a medical condition may cause depression . But there have been studies that follow participants without depression and examine the risk of depression incidence in relation to physical illnesses . The effects of disability as a risk factor for depression are most commonly identified in older people, but appear to operate across the age range . Although a range of factors is likely to be involved, persistent pain has been found to be an important predictor of depression . Medical illness presenting as depression . Shared genetic factors that increase the risk for both depression and particular physical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease may play a part in the relationship between medical conditions and depression . Additionally, depressive disorders can occur primarily as a side effect of the treatment of a physical disorder . Understanding the mechanisms that link depression and physical illness is clearly important for designing the types of intervention that will be most effective for prevention and treatment . Chronic diseases . Although many medical illnesses are associated with increased depression prevalence, there is a particularly strong association with chronic diseases . For all these conditions, there is a two- to threefold increased prevalence of depression compared with the unaffected population . The WHO survey findings noted earlier in this chapter show that a single chronic condition is associated with a doubled or tripled prevalence of depression, while for people with two or more chronic conditions, 23% had depression in addition to these conditions . Approaches to assessment and management . Increased awareness of the mental health needs of patients irrespective of disease categories is necessary in the training of personnel and the planning of services, so that mental health problems such as depression are appropriately recognized and managed . Possible confusion arising from multiple causes of symptoms has led some workers to advocate discounting physical symptoms when assessing comorbid depression . However, the evidence from investigations of the validity of diagnostic practice indicates that modifications to depression criteria are not an appropriate response to these problems . A number of depression case identification (or screening) tools are available to assist practice in this area . Recognition of depression is covered in more detail in Chapter 4 . There are well-founded concerns that standard guidance for the management of depression is inappropriate for people who experience depression together with medical conditions, because of uncertainty about the effectiveness of routine treatments for these people, and the risks of side effects and drug interactions related to these conditions and their treatments . As for depression in the absence of physical illness, a range of psychosocial interventions have been found to be effective . ","Depression is two to three times more common among people experiencing medical conditions, as physical illness increases the risks for depression and, vice versa, depression makes physical illness more likely. When depression and physical illnesses are combined, the course and outcome of both conditions are worsened, with increased disability, higher medical costs and greater likelihood of adverse outcomes (including death). People with depression are less likely to adhere to treatments for medical conditions or to adopt healthy behaviors and self-management for these health problems. Recognizing depression in people with physical health problems can be challenging, but being alert to the increased risk and using validated case-finding measures assist this process. There is a good evidence base for managing depression combined with medical conditions: selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are an appropriate first line drug treatment, and psychological therapies are effective."
9781910797310,chp5,"In general, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with tumor DNA damage and mutations induced by carcinogens in tobacco smoke . Known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, these therapies target the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and the CTLA-4 receptor . PD-1 is an inhibitory cell-surface receptor that is expressed on activated T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes and dendritic cells . Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) prevents the inhibition of the effector T-cell function, allowing T cells to maintain their tumor cell killing function (Figure 5.1) . Drugs in development . Several drugs are in development (Table 5.1) . The benefits of nivolumab were independent of clinical and tumor characteristics, including PD-L1 expression . In 582 patients with non-squamous NSCLC, nivolumab improved OS and ORR but not PFS (see Table 5.2) . The treatment effect was consistent in all patient subgroups, especially in PD-L1-positive tumors, except for never-smokers and those with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant tumors . Pembrolizumab benefited all patient subgroups except those with EGFR -mutant tumors and squamous histology, probably partly because of the small population size . Among the patients with at least 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, pembrolizumab resulted in significantly longer PFS and OS than docetaxel, suggesting PD-L1 has value as a predictive biomarker . In the POPLAR study, atezolizumab was compared with docetaxel in 287 patients with pretreated NSCLC . The ongoing OAK study will validate the efficacy of atezolizumab in patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC independently of PD-L1 positivity in tumor tissue . Safety, tolerability and efficacy appear to be similar across all PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors; about 10% of patients experience grade 3-4 adverse events . Grade 3-5 immune-related adverse events in 1% or more of patients were pneumonitis (2%) and severe skin reactions (1-2%) . In addition to the data in treatment-naive patients generated from phase I expanded cohorts, there are now specific first-line monotherapy studies . These randomized phase III studies are comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone with current platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimens, as summarized in Table 5.3 . Adjuvant and neoadjuvant studies . This is probably the best situation in which to demonstrate that an immunotherapy can cure more patients . Combination therapy with chemotherapy . Early data show impressive response rates, ranging from 33% to 55% in CHECKMATE-012, 30% to 58% in KEYNOTE-021, and 67% in early-phase atezolizumab studies . The concern with combining these therapies is toxicity, with reports of grade 3-4 adverse events ranging from 27% (KEYNOTE-021) to 45% (CHECKMATE-012) . While the response rates are certainly high with these combinations, the toxicities also appear to be increased . Mature follow-up data are required on safety and survival from these ongoing studies . Combination therapy with other checkpoint inhibition . KEYNOTE-021 combined pembrolizumab with ipilimumab in a dose escalation study in patients already treated with platinum chemotherapy . The data suggest that the combination has acceptable toxicity and robust responses . Similar results have been seen with the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab, including in patients with PD-L1-negative disease; several combination studies are ongoing . Combination therapy with small molecule inhibitors . This would suggest that oncogenic drivers induce immune escape in NSCLC through PD-L1 upregulation . Preclinical and early phase clinical data from KEYNOTE-001 suggest that prior therapy with EGFR inhibitors is associated with a lack of response to PD-1 inhibition . From early results, the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and EGFR inhibition appears to be safe, as suggested by the results from the combination of gefitinib and durvalumab . Combination therapy with radiotherapy . ","Nivolumab should be considered as a second-line treatment option for patients with non-squamous cell histology whose tumors are positive for programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and all patients with squamous cell histology. Pembrolizumab should be considered as a treatment option for all patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive. Generally, programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors have a similar side-effect profile and efficacy. Combination strategies with both cytotoxic T-lymphoma-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antagonism and first-line chemotherapy offer better response rates; however, caution needs to be exercised with the inherent risk of increased toxicity. Strong PD-L1 staining is a biomarker for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition."
9781910797181,ch07,"Optimal treatment . Behavioral support . Figure 7.2 shows a treatment plan in a typical smokers' clinic . a specified quit date . sessions at least weekly . Assessment session . In a group setting, smokers may be paired up to provide each other with support during the following week . After the quit date . During these sessions the smoker's expired-air carbon monoxide concentration is measured . It serves to boost the smoker's motivation by demonstrating improvement in a physiological marker . These medications are of critical importance in the treatment of nicotine dependence . However, its effect on smoking cessation does not rely on its antidepressant actions and is not confined to smokers who are depressed . Dosing typically begins on the quit date and continues for 8-12 weeks, depending on the product . Nicotine chewing gum was the first NRT to be developed and has been available in many countries for about 20 years . Two main doses are available, 2 mg and 4 mg, which typically yield about 1 mg and 1.5-2 mg nicotine, respectively . Smokers are advised to use 9-20 pieces of gum per day initially, tapering the frequency after 6 weeks . In practice, many smokers use far too little gum to be of much benefit . It may also be because smokers are worried about absorbing too much nicotine . Another concern for many smokers is that they will become dependent on the gum . In practice, persistent use of the gum is uncommon, and dependence is quite rare, probably because the gum releases nicotine much more slowly than cigarettes . Nicotine lozenges are available in two formulations . There is some evidence that the spray is most effective in more-dependent heavy smokers . Nicotine inhalators consist of a cartridge containing a nicotine-impregnated material . Thus, extremely frequent and persistent puffing is required to deliver an effective dose of nicotine . Nicotine mouth spray involves a container of nicotine solution that can be sprayed into the mouth - usually one dose into each cheek . Nicotine dissolvable oral strips are thin oral strips containing 2.5 mg of nicotine . It is clear that the benefit of NRT, as with any medication, depends on adequate dose and duration . Who can benefit from pharmacological treatment? . Smokers and health workers sometimes believe that if a smoker has tried a medication once, without success, they have demonstrated themselves to be unresponsive, and should not try the same medication again . Importantly, the efficacy of varenicline and NRT is not limited to highly dependent smokers; they have been demonstrated to help a wide range of daily smokers . Efficacy with non-daily smokers has not yet been demonstrated . Smoking reduction . There is some evidence, however, that smokers who cut down are more likely to go on to quit . They may also aid cessation in smokers who have not succeeded with other methods . E-cigarettes are very variable in the amount of nicotine they deliver and in the quality of manufacture . Other treatments . Many individuals and commercial organizations offer treatments for smoking, or gadgets that purport to help the smoker to break the habit . Graduated filters are designed to filter out more and more of the smoke and nicotine over time, with smokers switching to increasingly powerful filters over a period of weeks . This could enhance the effectiveness of NRT, or lead smokers to reduce the amount they smoke to avoid toxic effects . Of all smokers, pregnant women have the greatest need to stop . There are many reasons for treating hospital inpatients as a special case among smokers . In addition, hospitals should be smoke free; a policy that benefits all patients and staff, smokers and non-smokers . Psychiatric patients . Psychiatric patients are just as motivated to stop smoking as other smokers and it is good clinical practice to offer support for stopping on a regular basis to all smokers, which they can take up if they wish to . Smokers with comorbid alcohol or drug problems have lower success rates in quitting . Young smokers . The younger a smoker is when he or she stops, the greater the chance of a full recovery of life expectancy . Adolescent smokers quickly develop dependence, so behavioral support and medication would seem to be appropriate in some cases . Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of these treatments in adolescents . One problem may be instability in young smokers' determination to stop, even when they initiate a quit attempt . ","A structured behavioral support program involving several sessions concentrated in the first few weeks after the quit date can significantly increase smokers' chances of stopping permanently. Sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride (Zyban) and nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT, in the form of chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalator, lozenges, sublingual tablets, mouth spray or dissolvable oral strips) increase smokers' chances of stopping considerably. The highest quit rates can be achieved with either varenicline (Chantix/Champix) or dual-form NRT (patch plus one of the other forms of NRT). NRT, varenicline and bupropion are among the safest medicines available, although bupropion carries a small risk of seizure and allergic reaction (about 1/1000). Electronic cigarettes have become very popular and may help many smokers to stop smoking. They are much safer than conventional cigarettes, even if used long term. Concerns exist around the way some of them are being marketed and the variability in quality. Nortriptyline and cytisine are both effective at helping smokers to stop and are very cheap. Cytisine (available in much of Central and Eastern Europe for several decades and available over the counter) offers a safe and effective low-cost treatment that can be given with minimal supervision. It has yet to receive a marketing license in most of the world. A combination of behavioral support and medication quadruples the chances of a successful quit attempt; these treatments are among the most cost-effective life-preserving interventions available to health professionals. Hypnotherapy and acupuncture have received little research attention in relation to smoking cessation; to date, no specific effect in aiding smoking cessation has been found."
9783318066241,ch5,"To accurately diagnose acute pancreatitis (AP) and its complications, consensus definitions are needed . In 1993, a clinically based classification system was published following an international symposium on AP held in Atlanta in 1992 . It provided accurate definitions for local and systemic complications and severity (mild/severe AP) . In 2013, a new consensus updated the Atlanta classification: the revision of the Atlanta classification (RAC) . This chapter reviews the definitions for local and systemic complications, and the classification of severity, as provided by the RAC . Some patients with interstitial AP may develop acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFCs) (see page 42 . Necrotizing acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma, the peripancreatic fat, or both . According to prospective data, the overall incidence of necrosis in AP is 17%, comprising isolated pancreatic necrosis in 4.5% of affected patients, isolated peripancreatic fat necrosis in 4.4% and combined pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis in 8% . The CT signs and definitive extension of pancreatic necrosis may take several days to establish, so imaging before the fourth day from disease onset may underestimate the presence of pancreatic necrosis . Collections arising in the first 4 weeks following disease onset lack a defined wall . The RAC defines the following acute collections on the basis of their content . Therefore, this is typically a complication of interstitial AP . Collections persisting after 4 weeks . Collections that have not been reabsorbed over the first 4 weeks develop an encapsulating wall . According to the RAC, these mature collections can be classified in the following ways . Pseudocyst: an encapsulated collection of fluid with a well-defined inflammatory wall, usually outside the pancreas with minimal or no necrosis (homogeneous fluid density on imaging) . The collection can be intrapancreatic and/or extrapancreatic . Systemic complications . Exacerbation of pre-existing comorbidity, such as coronary artery disease or chronic lung disease secondary to AP, is defined as a systemic complication in the RAC . When this exacerbation leads to persistent organ failure (OF), the patient is considered to have persistent OF, not exacerbation of the pre-existing comorbidity . The RAC uses the validated modified Marshall scoring system to define OF in the respiratory, cardiovascular and renal systems (Table 5.1) . OF can be classified in a number of ways . According to time of onset: early OF develops during the first week after disease onset and is most frequently due to uncontrolled production of proinflammatory mediators as a consequence of the inflammation of the pancreas and surrounding tissues . Late OF, developing after the first week, is usually a consequence of infection of pancreatic necrosis or other nosocomial infections . Patients with transient OF have increased morbidity but very low mortality, whereas patients with persistent OF have maximum morbidity and 50% mortality . According to the number of organs involved: the RAC defines multiple OF as OF affecting more than one organ, a situation also associated with 50% mortality . Classification of severity . The severity of AP should be classified at discharge according to whether local and systemic complications developed during the course of the disease . In the first Atlanta classification published in 1993, AP was divided into mild (no complications) and severe (local or systemic complications) forms . This classification had a homogeneous mild category, without morbidity or mortality, but the severe category was heterogeneous, mixing patients with increased morbidity with others with a life-threatening condition . However, local or 'mild' systemic complications (exacerbation of previous comorbidity, transient OF) are associated with increased morbidity but very low mortality and these patients are considered as having moderate disease . Patients with persistent OF have a high risk of mortality, indicating severe disease . The RAC therefore promotes a three-category classification (Table 5.2) . mild disease with an uneventful clinical course . moderately severe disease with increased morbidity but a low risk of mortality . severe disease with maximum morbidity and a high risk of mortality . From a simplistic point of view, mild disease is defined by the absence of complications, severe disease as persistent OF, and patients with other local and systemic complications as having moderately severe disease . ","Early liquid peripancreatic collections without necrosis are called acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFCs). APFCs lasting for more than 4 weeks develop an encapsulating wall and are known as pseudocysts. Early collections associated with pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis are called acute necrotic collections. Those lasting for more than 4 weeks and developing an encapsulating wall are known as walled-off necrosis. In the revised Atlanta classification, acute pancreatitis is defined as mild, moderately severe and severe. Mild disease is defined by the absence of complications, severe disease as persistent (> 48 hours) organ failure; patients with other local and systemic complications are classified as having moderately severe disease. Mild disease is associated with an uneventful disease course. Moderately severe disease results in increased morbidity and severe disease is associated with maximum morbidity and increased mortality."
9783318068207,hh-6,"The FDA has approved many targeted therapies and immunotherapies with companion diagnostic tests (see next page) . NGS test results may identify FDA-approved therapies, guide clinical trial recommendations or prompt consideration of expanded access to investigational agents or off-label use of therapies approved for other indications . Many clinical trials now include molecular testing to assign treatments to patients based on the molecular profiles of their tumors . The FDA recognizes three levels of biomarkers and has commented on the analytic and clinical evidence necessary to support NGS tests for these biomarkers (Figure 4.1) . Level 1, companion diagnostics . A companion diagnostic is a test that informs the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapy . For approval of the test, there should be evidence of its analytic validity for each specific biomarker and a clinical study that establishes either the link between the result of that test and patient outcomes or clinical concordance with a previously approved companion diagnostic . Level 2, cancer mutations with evidence of clinical significance . Tests for cancer mutations allow physicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions . Level 3, cancer mutations with potential clinical significance . These are mutations that do not fall within level 1 or 2 . The variants are informational or used to direct patients toward clinical trials . Tests for these biomarkers should be supported by analytic validation and a clinical or mechanistic rationale for their inclusion in the panel . Molecular tumor boards . Approximately 9% of patients with metastatic cancer harbor targetable genomic alterations for optimal treatment selection with the standard treatments . An additional 27% of patients carry genomic abnormalities with convincing clinical evidence supporting the use of these alterations as predictive biomarkers for response to treatment outside of a therapy's registered indication . The test analyzes DNA isolated from FFPE tumor tissue specimens . It is used for patients with hematologic malignancies, sarcomas or solid tumors for which RNA sequencing is required . The test allows sensitive detection of translocations and fusions . TruSight Oncology 500 is a pan-cancer assay that identifies known and emerging biomarkers . Clinical basket trials and umbrella designs . Recent developments in molecular profiling of tumors have led to the development of biomarker-driven clinical trials . A basket trial tests a single treatment and a single biomarker (mutation X in Figure 4.2) in patients with different histologies . In an umbrella trial, participants have a single histology and multiple biomarkers are each matched to different treatments . Numerous clinical studies are now using novel diagnostics to ascertain the molecular pathways associated with cancer development and progression . MATCH is a Phase II precision medicine trial that aims to determine whether a drug or drug combination matched to specific genetic aberrations will effectively treat that cancer, regardless of tumor type . The primary endpoint for MATCH is the percentage of patients whose tumors have a complete or partial treatment response . The study provides FDA-approved targeted therapies contributed by collaborating pharmaceutical companies, catalogs the choice of genomic profiling tests by clinical oncologists and aims to identify the potential signals of drug activity . Early data show positive results in three cohorts of patients, described below . Colorectal cancer patients with BRAF p . Colorectal cancer patients with an HER2 (ERBB2) amplification . Colorectal cancer patients with high TMB . SPECTA is a collaborative European platform that supports the delivery of high-quality molecular and pathological screening across multiple cancer types to aid patient selection for clinical trials . The goal of the platform is to support biospecimen-based translational research and biomarker discovery and, ultimately, propose new treatment options for cancer patients . The aim is to increase patient access to potentially effective therapies while building a knowledge base for outcomes in off-label use . This is particularly important for patients with rare cancers, for which Phase II and III trials are unlikely to be conducted . I-PREDICT utilized tumor DNA sequencing and timely recommendations for individualized treatment with combination therapies . The investigators found that it was viable to administer customized multidrug regimens, with 49% of consented patients receiving personalized treatment . Patients are allocated to separate baskets according to their tumor type and gene fusion . The use of personalized medicine is potentially a cost-effective choice in cancer patients if a molecular selection can identify which patients will achieve partial, complete or durable responses to a particular treatment . These models should be the basis for obtaining reimbursement approval for the newly developed NGS platforms . ","Precision medicine in oncology matches an individual patient to the correct treatment, based on the biological and molecular features of the patient's cancer. The FDA recognizes a pathway of three levels of biomarkers, based on the clinical evidence necessary to support NGS tests. Multidisciplinary MTBs, comprising various medical disciplines, facilitate the incorporation of molecular diagnostics and interpretation of results into therapeutic decision-making for a patient with cancer. A basket trial is a biomarker-driven study in which a single treatment and single biomarker are tested in patients with different histologies. An umbrella trial is a biomarker-driven study in which participants with a single histology and multiple biomarkers are each matched to a particular treatment."
9781910797310,chp7,"BM have deleterious effects on many critical neurological functions . The DS-GPA score has a central role in the management of patients; focal interventions should preferentially be delivered to patients with a good prognosis . Radiation therapy, surgery and systemic therapies are options for the management of metastatic lesions in the brain . BM typically appear as contrast-enhanced lesions on CT or MRI (sequence T1 with gadolinium) . An algorithm for the management of BM is shown in Figure 7.1 . In small randomized trials in patients with a single metastatic brain lesion, surgery plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) increased survival compared with WBRT alone . Conversely, in another small randomized trial, no survival benefit was demonstrated . Nowadays, surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the tumor bed is an option . SRS decreases the likelihood of local relapse after resection . A randomized phase III trial is currently comparing adjuvant WBRT with SRS . No randomized trials have addressed the role of surgery for multiple lesions, and retrospective data are conflicting . As 7-10% of patients who undergo surgery suffer from major complications, candidates should be selected cautiously . Whole brain radiation therapy continues to be the standard of care for patients with a poor prognosis according to the DS-GPA (id est patients who are not candidates for surgery or SRS) with multiple (more than 3-5) BM . WBRT does not increase survival or quality of life compared with best supportive care (BSC), as reported in the large prospective randomized Quartz trial . Strategies to overcome neurocognitive impairment after WBRT include hippocampus-sparing WBRT or neuroprotective agents . In a large randomized trial (RTOG 9508), an SRS boost increased survival in patients with a good prognostic score and a single lesion . Although no randomized trials have directly compared surgery to SRS, SRS seems to provide a similar local control rate (80-90%), especially when SRS is combined with WBRT . The application of WBRT after SRS (or surgery) may have a negative effect on cognitive function . Thus, SRS is now generally performed without WBRT in patients with a limited number of lesions (up to 3) . SRS without WBRT is feasible as the initial treatment for patients with 5-10 BM . SRS leads to radiation necrosis in approximately 10% of patients, especially those who receive combined (WBRT+SRS) radiation . It can be difficult to distinguish between radiation necrosis and recurrent BM on conventional MRI . Systemic therapies . Glucocorticoids improve symptoms in up to 75% of patients with cerebral edema and are indicated in patients with neurological symptoms . The order of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often dictated by how symptomatic a patient is and their performance status (PS) . Radiotherapy is often used for very symptomatic patients with poor PS . Systemic treatment is usually the first choice for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic BM, particularly if a sensitizing driver mutation is present in the tumor . Concurrent WBRT and chemotherapy resulted in higher neurocognitive deficit without clear benefit in response rate or survival . European Society Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines and data from randomized trials support chemotherapy as a reasonable first-line treatment option for patients with stage IV NSCLC and asymptomatic BM . Chemotherapy may also be proposed as a salvage treatment . Targeted therapies . Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have antitumor activity in patients with NSCLC BM . Concurrent erlotinib and WBRT has demonstrated a good overall response rate (86%) with a median overall survival of 12 months . A high incidence of BM is seen in patients who have NSCLC with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement (40%) . Patients with BM from ALK -rearranged NSCLC who are treated with radiotherapy (SRS and/or WBRT) and crizotinib may have prolonged survival . Newer ALK -driven targeted therapy also seems promising . It is therefore reasonable to propose the use of targeted molecular compounds as first-line treatment for selected patients with stage IV NSCLC and asymptomatic BM . ","Brain metastases (BM) are common in the natural history of patients with NSCLC. The Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) score, which is based on age, Karnofsky performance score, the presence of extracranial metastases and the number of BM, can guide clinicians' decisions. Surgical resection may be required for patients presenting with neurological symptoms or a large single lesion. Whole brain radiotherapy was the standard treatment for patients with a poor prognosis, but this has recently been challenged. Stereotactic radiosurgery could be given to patients with a limited number of small well-defined BM, as it provides excellent local control with limited toxicities. Systemic treatment (chemotherapy or targeted compounds) is a reasonable treatment option for asymptomatic patients."
9781908541086,ch_5,"Genetic factors . The most potent risk factor for eating disorders is female gender (see Chapter 2) . This association is likely to reflect biological as well as psychosocial factors . Family studies indicate that first-degree relatives of patients with anorexia have an increased prevalence of eating disorders (Table 3.1), and that first-degree relatives of patients with bulimia or binge-eating disorder appear to be at increased risk of eating disorders, mood disorders and substance abuse . Similar to other complex disorders, the eating disorders are likely to have a polygenic etiology, each gene having a relatively small effect . Physiological factors . Childhood obesity is a risk factor for bulimia and binge-eating disorder . A pear-shaped body and relatively high amounts of body fat may also predispose to eating disorders . Around 20% of individuals with diabetes mellitus develop an eating disorder . This suggests that insulin-glucagon systems may be involved in the predisposition for eating disorders . Neurobiological factors . These functional abnormalities could maintain some of the eating disorder behaviors . Family functioning . Historically, the role of dysfunctional styles of family interaction was put forward in theories of the development of eating disorders . Unfortunately and unfairly, this has led to some parenting styles being blamed for causing eating disorders in children . parental attitudes toward eating, weight and body shape . parental eating and weight-related behavior modeled in the home . Perceived pressure to be thin, family criticism regarding weight, and maternal investment in slenderness predict eating disturbances in adolescents . Furthermore, families of individuals with anorexia tend to have a higher rate of parental eating disorders, family dieting and adverse comments from family members about eating, weight or appearance . The families of individuals with bulimia are often more chaotic and conflicted . A wide range of other childhood adversities and stressful life events has been associated with eating problems during adolescence . The effects of stress on eating are not uniform . Developmental factors . It is still debatable whether there is a correlation between eating problems in early childhood and those in adolescence . Mothers of patients with eating disorders have reported reliance on scheduled feeding and prematurely introduced solids more frequently than controls . Picky eating and digestive problems predicted preanorexic behavior . Early eating problems were also a predictor of the future onset of bulimia . Body-image distortions in this age group are associated with dieting and weight concerns . Prepuberty and adolescence . Several studies have identified associations between disturbed eating in adolescents and . weight concerns . discomfort about discussing problems with parents . maternal preoccupation with diets . The biological changes of puberty certainly contribute to the onset of eating disorders . In girls, an association between early pubertal timing and eating-disorder symptoms as well as diagnosis has been observed in a number of studies . Individual variables . Intrapersonal factors . Depression is one of the most salient psychiatric comorbidities in both men and women with eating disorders . Similarly, increased levels of anxiety and obsessiveness have been described in young people and adults with eating disorders . Similarly, the risk for bulimia is increased by the presence of overanxious disorder or social phobia relative to controls . Clinicians have described internalized anger and rage as primary emotions in patients with eating disorders . Body-image disturbance is a well-known risk factor for clinical and subclinical levels of eating disorders . However, body-image disturbance seems to be more closely related to restricted eating, and global psychological functioning more closely related to bulimia . Body dissatisfaction is not only a defining characteristic of eating disorders but also a contributing factor in their development and maintenance . Interpersonal functioning . Impulse behaviors and substance abuse . The pattern of impulsive behaviors associated with bulimia is not common in those with anorexia . When treating a patient with either an eating disorder or a substance-abuse problem, the clinician should always consider the possibility of a comorbid substance-abuse or eating problem . Several psychological and biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the comorbidity of eating disorders and substance abuse . Biological factors have been investigated in terms of the genetic contributions to alcoholism, drug abuse and eating disorders . The origins of eating disorders are widely seen as a complex combination of biological and environmental factors . ","Clinicians and patients are best served by considering eating disorders from a bio-psycho-social perspective, unified in a framework of developmental psychopathology. All components are present, and interact to increase the risk for disorder as development proceeds. Disorder represents the crystallization of these interactions into syndromes which, in this case, are a developmental outcome, not simply the burgeoning of a latent biological deficit, as reductionist models of psychopathology would have it. Eating problems usually emerge in the context of pubertal change. Parental attitudes and behaviors towards eating, weight and body shape have a strong influence on the development of a child's relationship with food and body image, both healthy and unhealthy. Stressors and life events, such as childhood abuse, separations or bereavement, may precipitate the onset of eating disorders. Psychiatric comorbidities in both men and women with eating disorders include depression, anxiety, obsessive behavior and body-image disturbance. When treating a patient with either an eating disorder or substance-abuse problem, clinicians should always consider the possibility of comorbidity."
9781908541796,chapter8,"Post-transplant lymphomas . Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of normal B cells will lead to a sustained lymphoproliferation unless controlled by CD8+ T cells . Not surprisingly, therefore, when the controlling T cells are suppressed, either by an immunosuppressive agent such as ciclosporin (cyclosporine) or some other form of T-cell depletion, there can be a resurgence of EBV-infected B cells . The incidence of PTLDs following solid-organ or bone-marrow transplantation depends on a number of factors including the depth of immunosuppression achieved . In renal transplantation, the incidence is thought to be about 2% . In heart and lung transplantation, it is a little higher, but in T-cell-depleted bone-marrow transplants, the incidence has been reported to be as high as 40-60% in some series (Table 8.1) . There is a bimodal distribution of incidence . EBV-positive PTLDs are most common within the first year of transplantation (especially in EBV-negative patients with an EBV-positive donor), whereas EBV-negative disease peaks at 10 years . Overall, approximately 60% of PTLD cases are EBV-positive . polymorphic PTLD . monomorphic PTLD (Figure 8.1) . Usually, both early and polymorphic disease occur soon after a transplant and are EBV-positive . There are several subtypes of monomorphic disease such as diffuse large B-cell type, Burkitt type and Hodgkin type . The tumor may arise in donor- or recipient-derived B cells, though recipient-derived PTLDs are much more common . Clinical presentation of PTLD is highly variable . Patients may present with systemic symptoms, such as weight loss, fever or night sweats, or simply with lymphadenopathy . The most common extranodal site is the gastrointestinal tract . Simply reducing the level of immunosuppression may allow sufficient resurgence of normal T cells to control proliferating B cells . For more aggressive tumors, single-agent rituximab may be effective, although additional combination chemotherapy is often necessary . Cellular therapy with EBV-specific T cells is being explored in clinical trials and appears effective even in some very resistant cases . HIV-associated lymphoma . The association of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with HIV-1 has been known since 1985 . There are several well-recognized ways in which HIV-associated lymphomas present . The most common presentation is systemic lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Burkitt type . Extranodal disease is more common than in HIV-negative patients . As with other forms of HIV-associated lymphoma, EBV positivity is a frequent finding . Primary CNS lymphoma may occur in the context of very low CD4 counts . Clearly, with better HIV treatment the incidence of this form of HIV-associated lymphoma is diminishing . The rarest HIV-associated lymphoma is the so-called 'body cavity' or primary effusion lymphoma, which is also associated with human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) coinfection . These lymphomas are aggressive and present in the late stages of HIV infection, causing the accumulation of ascites and pericardial and pleural effusions . Plasmablastic lymphoma occurs almost exclusively in patients with HIV, and presents with lesions affecting the jaw and oral mucosa, although other extranodal sites may be involved . They are CD20−, extremely aggressive and the majority of patients will die of their lymphoma despite intensive chemotherapy . Treatment of HIV-associated lymphoma is directed by its pathological subtype . All patients should receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) during chemotherapy . Particularly in patients in whom the HIV infection is well controlled, however, rituximab is generally considered to be important . The International Prognostic Index applies to HIV-associated lymphomas; in addition, a low CD4 count confers a poorer prognosis . Treatment of relapsed HIV-associated lymphomas is difficult . These patients frequently do not tolerate high-dose therapy well and its use may therefore be confined to those with better-controlled HIV disease . ","Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for the development of B-cell lymphoma. Viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (associated with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and human herpes virus 8 (associated with primary effusion lymphoma) are often implicated. Treatment should target the lymphoma and the cause of the immunosuppression (id est highly active antiretroviral therapy in lymphomas associated with HIV and a reduction in therapeutic immunosuppression in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Improved HIV treatment is leading to a falling incidence of HIV-associated lymphoma. The use of rituximab in HIV-associated B-cell lymphomas is generally considered standard in those with well-controlled infection."
9783318067095,ch4,"As more digital tools are deployed in health research and care settings, new questions emerge about how to use them responsibly and ethically . The development of the IRB peer review process stemmed from egregious acts whereby researchers disregarded the rights and welfare of research participants . 2 At that time, there was no treatment for syphilis; however, after penicillin was developed, the study participants were not treated and the study continued for nearly 40 years . The National Research Act was passed in 1974; it involved creating a National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research with a goal of preventing future atrocities . It was this Commission that required the formation of IRBs and also wrote the Belmont Report . Published in 1979, the Belmont Report describes three guiding principles of ethical biomedical and behavioral research: respect for persons, beneficence and justice . As cybersecurity concerns increased with research involving information and communication technologies (ICT), the Department of Homeland Security developed the Menlo Report . The regulations speak to basic protections for human research participants in subpart A, known as the Common Rule . Additional subparts speak to protections for vulnerable populations, including children and prisoners . The three core principles of biomedical ethics described in the Belmont Report are at the core of research ethics and should be carefully considered during the study design phase and ethics review process . Respect for persons is demonstrated through the informed consent process, which occurs when a person is given the information needed to make a sound decision about whether to volunteer to willingly participate . How this information is conveyed is important because volunteering to be a research participant is different from, say, accepting terms of service (ToS) to access an app, or signing a consent form to obtain medical care . Consent to participate in research is a choice that an individual can only make if presented with information in a setting conducive to good decision-making . The informed consent process involves more than signing a form to document voluntary participation - it is the first of what may be many interactions between a participant and the research team and is part of developing a trusted relationship . Technological literacy is another important consideration . For informed consent to be meaningful, participants will need to be 'tech-literate' enough to understand the specifics of how their data will be obtained and used . Moving forward, this charge will require a commitment from the medical community to provide accessible public-facing educational modules . A participant may also think that if the study team has access to their health data in real time, 24/7, then that means someone is paying attention to them (which may not be the case) . One organization working to advance meaningful informed consent in digital health research is Sage Bionetworks; it has published a toolkit to assist researchers . Determining risk of harm is a somewhat subjective process, yet worth breaking down . Thus, the same potential harm presents a low risk for most, but a high risk for some important groups . Safeguarding data and managing data-sharing protocols are important considerations when applying the principle of beneficence, and researchers, IRBs and research participants need to think about carefully these . Research is inherently risky because we are learning something that is not yet known . Research participants are often told about risks as an odds ratio . For example, in studies that include a test for maximum oxygen uptake, participants are required to exercise to exhaustion . Because of this particular risk of harm, the research team can mitigate risk by having access to personnel and equipment used to treat a cardiac event . There is no potential benefit of knowledge gain if the study is poorly designed and the tools are not trustworthy . The principle of justice focuses on the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of research and recruitment protocols that are inclusive of those most likely to benefit from knowledge gained . To do that requires that we design technologies that are accessible and, in some cases, culturally tailored . With that in mind, including end users in the development process who represent a wide cross-section of our society is one way we can be responsive to the principle of justice . For example, in a study designed to increase physical activity in refugee women, the researcher decided to use a wrist-worn accelerometer to assess daily movement . The participants were given the sensor and shown how to use it . One week later, the researcher returned to gather the measurement tools and found that no data had been collected . This story sheds light on the fact that while digital tools should improve access to health research and healthcare, they can also perpetuate disparities and prevent access if not well designed and deployed . ","The principles that guide the ethical conduct of biomedical and behavioral research include: respect for persons, beneficence, justice (Belmont Report) and respect for law and public interest (Menlo Report). Knowing how to apply ethical principles is a responsibility of all stakeholders involved in digital health research, including technologists, researchers and ethics review boards."
9781910797631,chp1,"Use of the term depression to describe low mood and a 'depression of the spirits' gradually entered usage from the 18th century . On the other hand, our understanding of the physiological changes and genetic markers associated with depression is rapidly advancing, with increasingly sophisticated research techniques providing a clearer picture of brain function abnormalities associated with depression and the ways that gene-environment interactions may give rise to this disorder . The impact of depression . There is evidence that maternal depression can have a negative effect on children - who may show deficits in social, cognitive and psychological functioning, and appear to have heightened vulnerability for depression and other mental health problems in later life . Depression is currently ranked as the third leading cause of disease burden in the world, and the leading cause of disability in middle- and high-income countries . Depression combined with long-term illness also causes greater disability, more extensive loss of productivity and greater increases in healthcare costs, and it is associated with more treatment complications and increased mortality . The risk of suicide for individuals with a history of depression is more than double that for the general population (see Chapter 8) . Around 60% of people who commit suicide have had depression, and younger people who kill themselves often have an alcohol or substance misuse disorder in addition to being depressed . Changes in prevalence . A number of studies identified increases in the prevalence of depression during the 20th century, and commentators have been prompted to talk of a 'depression epidemic' afflicting industrialized societies . What is not clear is whether there has been a true increase in prevalence, whether we have become better at diagnosing depression by using structured diagnostic interviews, or whether the threshold for diagnosing clinically significant depression has become lower . Study findings concerning increased rates of depression are equivocal - although increases have often been identified by comparing cross-sectional studies, increases are generally not seen in longitudinal studies of depression prevalence within well-defined populations . While there is some evidence for onset at younger ages and possible increases in incidence of depression overall, it seems that the extent of any increase in prevalence may have been overstated . Several of the national studies that found increases in adolescent emotional problems during this period have indicated a leveling-off of prevalence since 2000 . For adult depression, reviews consistently indicate an increase in rates between 1960 and 1975, with mixed findings over subsequent years . public health campaigns to improve the understanding of depression . improved identification of depression in primary care . the growth of talking treatments for psychological problems . Challenges for assessment and management . Overmedicalizing depression . The diagnosis of depression has, at its heart, features of distress, sadness and dejection, which are - to some extent - part of the human condition: differentiating between this 'normal' unhappiness and clinical depression remains a challenge . There are valid concerns that the breadth of severity encompassed by current diagnostic symptoms may lead to overdiagnosis of depression . Even though depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, many people need, but do not receive, treatment . In general, people with depression and other mental health problems face stereotyped views and discrimination . At a fundamental level, important questions and uncertainties remain about the best way to understand and classify depression . A continuity between milder forms of depression and a fully symptomatic disorder appears in community studies that have examined course and correlates for a range of presentations . Depression that does not meet the full criteria for a formal diagnosis is increasingly recognized to cause considerable suffering and places a significant burden on the healthcare system; it is also related to increased mortality and is a risk factor for future major depression . Developing useful approaches to understand and assist people who experience depressive symptoms across the spectrum of presentations remains a central goal . Understanding the biology of depression . Knowledge about depression and its management has developed significantly since the latter half of the 20th century . The discovery of the MAOIs and TCAs revolutionized the treatment of depression, enabling hitherto chronically depressed individuals to return to normal levels of functioning . Consequently, depression was conceptualized as arising from the dysfunction of synaptic transmission of the catecholamines . Concurrently, psychotherapy has become increasingly refined, targeting and correcting the specific problems associated with depression - a negative thinking style or interpersonal difficulties . While there has been considerable growth in our knowledge of the causes, course and management of depression, gaps in our understanding remain . Although the overwhelming majority of patients with depression are managed within primary care, much of the evidence and resulting clinical guidance is derived from studies in the secondary and tertiary sectors . Better treatments . Treatment delivery problems . ","Depression has been evident as a problem for individuals and societies since antiquity, but public and professional awareness has markedly increased over the past half-century. Although much progress has been made in clarifying the clinical features and distribution of depression within populations, significant debate remains and there are ongoing difficulties about how to best understand and manage depression, particularly in its milder forms. Improved knowledge about the features, course and management of depression has enabled more prompt recognition, evidence-based treatment decisions and improved outcomes. However, depression is still both under- and over-diagnosed, and therapies are not always targeted appropriately: many depressed people do not receive treatment that could help them whilst prescribing for patients with mild or uncertain symptoms remains evident."
9781912776696,hh-6,"Sometimes the data through the p -value can be misleading . The false positive occurs when the null hypothesis is true (id est there is no treatment difference) but the data give a significant p -value and a treatment difference is falsely declared . The false negative occurs when the alternative hypothesis is true (id est there is a treatment difference) but the data give a non-significant p -value and the difference between treatments is not detected . The false negative is referred to as the type II error . Consider the two-sample t -test for comparing two treatment means, μ and μ . Data from the clinical trial comparing those means will provide either a significant difference or a non-significant difference . If the data provide a significant p -value, the correct conclusion can be drawn, confirming a treatment difference . Again, though, this will not always occur and from time to time a non-significant p -value will indicate no treatment difference (top right box) . This is the false negative, the type II error (beta [beta] error) . Controlling type I and II errors . By reducing the potential for one of these errors, the potential for the other error increases . Controlling the type I error . Controlling the type II error . The type II error is more difficult to control . The potential for that false negative is controlled through a related quantity called power . Power = 100% − type II error . As examples, if the probability of the type II error is 10% then the power is 90%; if the trial is powered at 80%, then the probability of a type II error is 20% . They are less concerned with the false negative, the type II error . The type II error is more the sponsor's problem - a sponsor does not want to fail to demonstrate a treatment difference when, in truth, there is a treatment benefit for the experimental treatment . Regulators recommend that later-phase trials have at least 80% power . Calculating sample size . Table 3.1 shows the calculated power for a range of values for the true treatment difference . From these data, if the true treatment difference is 0.50 mmol/L, the trial has a power of 62.3% (see Table 3.1) . The only way to increase the power is to increase the sample size . Table 3.2 provides the values for power at the same specified levels of effect as in Table 3.1 after doubling the sample size to 100 patients per treatment group . All the values for power have increased . In particular, the power has increased from 62.3% to 89.5% at a treatment difference of 0.50 mmol/L . A sample size of 102 patients per treatment group would give the trial 90% power, while a sample size of 76 per treatment group would give the trial 80% power . This is the basis of sample size calculation . A level of effect of interest is specified and the sample size required to give, say, 90% power is then calculated . the expected difference in response rates with the specified power - this treatment difference could also be expressed in terms of a relative risk reduction or an odds ratio . the targeted difference between the two means . the median OS anticipated in the control group . the treatment difference to be targeted, expressed as either an HR or an increase in the median OS . Missing data . If 5% of patients are expected to be non-evaluable for the primary analysis, then the required sample size would be increased by 5% to account for these non-evaluable patients without compromising the power . Event-driven trials . The power of a study based on a time-to-event endpoint is determined not directly by the number of patients, but by the number of patients who experience the event being studied . For example, a trial in which 100 out of 1000 patients experienced the event has the same power as a trial in which 100 out of 300 patients had the event . Many oncology studies with a time-to-event primary endpoint are therefore event driven and the trial data are analyzed when the required number of events are observed in the two treatment groups combined . First, calculate how many patients with events are needed for the required power . Sample size re-evaluation . As discussed, the power of a study when the primary endpoint is a time-to-event endpoint is driven by the number of patients who have the event . ","Every trial has the potential to yield a false-positive or a false-negative result - the false positive is known as the type I error and the false negative the type II error. Potential for the false positive is controlled at 5%, the significance level, while the false negative is controlled via the power. Power is equal to 100% − type II error. The type II error is the false negative, missing a real difference, while the power is the true positive, capturing a real difference. Power can be calculated at the planning stage, in advance of running the trial, by making various assumptions about, in particular, the magnitude of the treatment effect. The sample size calculation is based on the requirement to detect a prespecified treatment difference, often referred to as the clinically relevant difference, with a certain level of power, usually 80%, or at least 90% in a Phase III pivotal trial. As many oncology studies are powered on a primary time-to-event endpoint - power being determined by the number of patients with events - many oncology studies are event driven, with the statistical analysis taking place once the required number of patients with events have been reported. It is possible to increase the sample size if the event rate is lower than anticipated - if this is done in a blinded way, there is no statistical penalty or implication for the statistical method to be used for analysis."
9783318066685,ch1,"History of genetic therapy . Genetic effects may be the consequence of a single gene (monogenic effect), a small number of genes (oligogenic effects) or numerous genes (polygenic effects) . A frequent corollary follows that any mutations in the genetic code may result in dysfunctional proteins, resulting in a disease state . Although 5000-8000 monogenic diseases have been classified so far, treatments for such diseases have been palliative, without addressing the root cause of the disease . Defining gene therapy . This transfer of genetic information, which may be transient or permanent, produces gene products for intercellular, intracellular or systemic uses that may affect endogenous genes, compensate for pathogenic genes or augment defective genes . Modern gene therapy and regulatory milestones . The gradual refinement of gene therapy techniques was a hallmark of the new millennium . Efforts by various research teams in the first two decades of the 2000s demonstrated the potential of gene therapy to ameliorate symptoms in various disease cases . The second decade of the millennium saw the approval of several gene therapy products and clinical trials by national regulatory agencies . Strimvelis, a gene therapy strategy for ADA-SCID, was approved by the EMA in 2016 . Disease candidates for gene therapy . Besides the aforementioned disease candidates, other key diseases that may be amenable to gene therapy are described in the following paragraphs . While monogenic, the disease is known to be caused by over 1990 mutations in the CTFR gene . Multiple mutations in the HBB gene have been linked to both diseases . Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) are T cells that have been genetically modified to express an artificial T-cell receptor . Another genetic therapy approach for targeting cancer cells involves using competent and specific viruses to attack tumor cells, but not healthy cells, lysing the tumor cells as part of the viral life cycle . Steps for development of gene therapy . Gene therapy faces numerous challenges in clinical translation . characterizing the gene of interest . translocating the gene from the vector system to the nucleus of the cell (and, if necessary, integrating the genetic cargo) . expressing the gene cargo . Analysis of the gene, gene product and related biological pathways . To assess the suitability of gene therapy for a particular disease or condition, the preclinical scientist needs to analyze various component factors . The primary factor involves determining the sequence of the gene in question and the various mutations that can affect it . This is followed by the biological characterization of the disease pathway, across the transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic spectrum, to determine the expression levels of the gene of interest and any associated genes in individuals with and without the disease or condition . Quantitative assays to measure expression of the gene or levels of the gene product are also needed . Strategies for correcting the pathogenic gene . The second factor is disease dependent and revolves around the selection of a gene therapy strategy . Clinical gene therapy can be classified based on the mechanism by which the therapeutic agent ameliorates disease symptoms . Gene augmentation involves introducing a new gene to combat disease or to replace a mutated gene with a healthy copy . The delivery of genetic material (achieved by packaging the gene of interest in a vector) results in the transcription and translation of a desired gene product . This is canonically harnessed to deliver a 'healthy' copy of the gene to help restore biological function . Early gene therapy trials involved the transduction of immune cells or hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo, followed by reintroduction of modified cells to effect a biological response . More modern trials have investigated the effect of in vivo gene therapy . While gene augmentation may have therapeutic benefits for loss-of-function mutations, this approach is not readily applicable to . diseases resulting from improper regulation of the gene product (for example, cancer, cohesinopathies and diabetes) . Gene silencing reduces the expression of, or 'knocks down', a malfunctioning gene . Gene silencing can be used in gain-of-function diseases to inhibit the functioning of a mutated protein and so ameliorate disease symptoms . Such techniques enable in situ modification of the genetic code to permanently correct the disease mutation . Subsequent to the characterization of the disease in model systems and the selection and development of a gene therapy strategy, the next objective involves delivering the gene therapy agent to the affected tissue . ","Gene therapy involves the addition of nucleic acid-based products to a cell, either to compensate for a pathogenic loss of a protein or suppress the expression of a toxic protein. The transfer of genetic material may be transient or permanent, with non-viral and viral vectors, and it can be executed in an ex vivo context or directly in vivo. Clinical translation of a gene therapy agent has many hurdles to overcome. These range from identifying the target gene and designing the drug for efficient specific delivery of the required levels of expression to considering the genotoxic and immunologic risks. Monogenic diseases lend themselves to treatment using gene therapies. Ex vivo manipulation of hematopoietic stem cells is paving the way to clinical approvals."
9781908541406,ch_14,"In acute DIC, the consumption of clotting factors and platelets in the diffusely distributed thrombi may lead to a hemorrhagic diathesis and clinical bleeding . The paradoxical combination of bleeding and thrombosis in a hypotensive patient with sepsis, cancer or obstetric accident should raise suspicion of the syndrome, which is confirmed by examination of the blood film and coagulation studies . Some causes of DIC are listed in Table 12.1 . Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation . Chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation . The survival of these patients is worse than that of cancer patients without DIC . Clinical presentation . Bleeding is characteristic of acute DIC, and is often a persistent oozing from wounds or incisions . For example, the sudden appearance of wound bleeding in a patient receiving an intraoperative blood transfusion may suggest an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction and DIC . Other types of bleeding encountered include ecchymoses, epistaxis and hemorrhage from the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts . In patients with obstetric DIC, persistent uterine hemorrhage is often observed . On occasion, acute DIC that initially presents with bleeding evolves into chronic DIC in which thrombosis predominates . In many disorders that induce DIC, tissue-factor-bearing microparticles are released from the surface of monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells . The consequence of this extensive exposure to tissue factor is a profound activation of coagulation and the generation of large amounts of thrombin (see Chapter 1) . Thrombin promotes platelet activation and the platelet aggregates occlude the microvasculature . The consumption of platelets accounts for the thrombocytopenia that is typical of DIC . Thrombin becomes bound to antithrombin and thrombomodulin, and these proteins are soon consumed . Following binding to thrombomodulin, thrombin activates the anticoagulant protein C, which also becomes depleted, predisposing to microvascular thrombosis . As part of the acute inflammatory reaction, raised levels of the C4B-binding protein result in the binding of more free protein S, and therefore render it unavailable as a cofactor of the anticoagulant protein C . Platelet levels, however, usually remain low . Recommended clinical criteria for diagnosing DIC are . hemorrhage, thrombosis or both, associated with progressive organ dysfunction . a disorder that promotes tissue injury, cell death or release of tissue factor (see Table 12.1) . Acute disseminated intravascular coagulation . The treatment of acute DIC is primarily directed toward the underlying cause . Patients with acute DIC may have profound bleeding, usually because of hypofibrinogenemia . Table 12.3 lists agents used for the management of bleeding in such patients . Fibrinogen levels may be increased by administering cryoprecipitate . Alternatively, fibrinogen concentrate provides hemostatic levels . Administering platelets should elevate the count and help stem bleeding . DIC results from activation of coagulation so there has been considerable interest in examining whether anticoagulants might be beneficial . Initial experience with heparin in patients with acute DIC was disastrous; bleeding was accentuated and mortality increased . Antithrombin concentrate, 30 000 IU over 4 days, decreased mortality in septic patients with DIC compared with placebo (22.2% vs 40%, p < 0.01) . However, there was a trend toward increased bleeding (7.0% vs 5.2%, p = 0.6) . Chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation . However, the most common cause of chronic DIC is cancer, and many tumors are resistant to therapy . Another approach to controlling chronic DIC is through the use of thrombomodulin, a protein that activates protein C and binds and inactivates thrombin . showed that a recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (ART-123) improved DIC and alleviated bleeding symptoms in patients with hematologic malignancies or infection . It has been approved in Japan for the treatment of DIC; further trials in Western populations are anticipated . ","Persistent oozing from venepuncture sites in a septic patient, or massive vaginal bleeding in an obstetric patient, suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A DIC score >= 5 is indicative of overt DIC. Hypofibrinogenemia usually indicates acute DIC, but the fibrinogen level is often normal or elevated in chronic DIC and it is not a reliable marker of the condition. Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause of DIC; bleeding is controlled with cryoprecipitate and platelet infusions."
9781908541703,ch_2,"In 2010, there were 2864 deaths from breast cancer (2840 women and 24 men) . In India in 2012 there were 144 937 cases and 70 218 deaths from breast cancer . Classic epidemiological studies repeated worldwide have established risk-modifying associations with breast cancer (Table 1.1) . Age is by far the greatest risk factor for breast cancer in women . The incidence of breast cancer increases with age; approximately 50% of breast cancers occur in women aged 50-64 years, and a further 30% occur in women over the age of 70 years . There is clear evidence that regular drinking also increases the risk of recurrence, as well as contralateral breast cancer, in breast cancer survivors . It has been difficult to establish smoking as a risk factor for breast cancer . Although studies have indeed found an association, the effect of smoking on breast cancer risk is not as strong as its effect on the risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases or other cancers . On the other hand, smoking does increase the risk of metastatic relapse (especially in the lungs) after treatment of breast cancer . There is good evidence that exercise and physical activity reduce the risk of both premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer, as well as the risk of recurrence after a diagnosis of breast cancer . Weight reduction is also associated with a reduced risk . Women who work night shifts appear to have an increased risk of developing breast cancer . There is increasing and compelling evidence that mammographic breast density correlates directly with the risk of breast cancer, with a relative risk of up to 4 between the most and least dense breasts . The breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 (17q21) and BRCA2 (13q14) are associated with a high risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a family history . Moreover, changes in BRCA2 do not appear to be restricted to breast cancer . Other genes associated with breast cancer . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are not the only genes implicated in breast cancer . One of the common DNA-sequence variants that confers a small increase in breast cancer risk is CHEK2 . risk of disease . relapse and survival risk . It is also examining whether any intervention that changes such methylation profiles alters the risk of developing breast cancer . The risk of breast cancer is increased two- to threefold in women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer; the risk is also increased, but to a lesser extent, in women with a second-degree relative who is affected . The risk is particularly high if . the relative has bilateral breast cancer . The genetics of breast cancer are discussed more fully in Genetics . The risk of breast cancer is increased in women from higher socioeconomic classes and living in urban areas . Age at first full-term pregnancy appears to be the most important factor influencing hormonal status and thereby reducing the risk of breast cancer . Furthermore, multiparous postmenopausal women have a lower risk of breast cancer than nulliparous women . Pregnancy-associated hypertension may be associated with reduced risk and diethylstilbestrol exposure of the mother with increased risk . However, a large meta-analysis of 53 studies and 83 000 women in 16 countries found no increased risk of breast cancer in women who had had an abortion, largely refuting this hypothesis . Obesity confers an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women . High consumption of animal fats has also been linked to breast cancer . However, a meta-analysis of cohort studies involving over 330 000 women found no evidence for an association between the relative risk of breast cancer and dietary fat intake . On the other hand, a randomized trial in early-stage breast cancer has shown that a reduction in dietary fat intake lowered the risk of breast cancer recurrence . A diet based predominantly on bread and pasta is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer compared with a diet based predominantly on fruit and vegetables . Oral contraceptives . A meta-analysis involving over 150 000 women examined the influence of oral contraceptive use on the risk of breast cancer . The risk is particularly high when oral contraceptives are taken before the first full-term pregnancy . The slight increase in risk associated with oral contraceptives should, however, be viewed in the context of women's health in general . There is no evidence to indicate how current formulations of oral contraceptives affect breast cancer risk . Several large observational studies have clearly shown that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of developing breast cancer . ","Age is the greatest risk factor. Mutations in the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 denote high risk but account for only a small proportion of cancers. Mutations in several other genes, including CHEK2, TP53 and EMSY, are also involved. Hormonal factors, such as menstrual and obstetric history and exogenous hormones affect the risk of breast cancer. Diet, exercise, alcohol and smoking are modifiable risk factors. It is arguable whether the use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, early childbearing and long-term breast-feeding are modifiable in a modern society. Mammographic breast density is an independent and powerful risk factor that is not yet fully explained."
9781910797211,ch01,"Prodromal Parkinson's disease . The Parkinson's journey may begin long before diagnosis, as Parkinson's disease is now recognized to have a prodromal period dominated by a number of non-motor symptoms . Those who have the non-motor prodrome will have had unexplained symptoms for years, while those with a dominant motor presentation may have had symptoms for only a few months . While the cardinal motor symptoms and signs of rest tremor, akinesia and rigidity remain the mainstay of diagnosis, the prodrome of non-motor symptoms described above develops in the majority of patients . At least half of all patients experience mood disturbance with anxiety or depression at some stage of the illness, including in the prodromal phase . Delivering the diagnosis . Care must be taken in how the diagnosis is delivered . It is best to break the news of a patient's diagnosis in the presence of their spouse, partner or other family members . The disease is only slowly progressive . There are many effective symptomatic therapies that can help maintain quality of life for the majority of the illness . Regardless of the stage of the disease, non-motor symptoms, in particular depression or mood disturbance, dominate as the predictor of quality of life . Early-stage stable Parkinson's disease . Many patients who have already been diagnosed will have read on the internet, or will even have been told by another clinician, that treatment is only effective for 5 years . It is important to recognize the patient who has this misconception in order to unequivocally dispel it . Patients who may not have fully accepted the diagnosis may be fearful of treatment . It is important to acknowledge this, and to help the patient deal with their fear and denial . In early Parkinson's disease, motor and non-motor symptoms can be controlled in a stable fashion with relatively simple medication regimens . Initial therapy . There is also increasing evidence for the benefits of exercise or physical therapy, even in early or mild Parkinson's disease . Mid-stage unstable Parkinson's disease . In most patients, the early stable period of disease eventually develops into an unstable mid stage, which remains poorly defined . Patients experience some balance issues, fear of falling, early morning off periods and dyskinesias . Patients can experience a return of any of their motor symptoms (tremor, slowness or stiffness) . Common non-motor fluctuations are off-period anxiety, depression or fogginess of thought . Around the same time, although not necessarily linked, many patients experience involuntary movements in response to their dopaminergic therapy (dyskinesias) . The multidisciplinary team has a crucial role during this period to reassure the patient and carer, re-evaluate motor and non-motor symptoms and ensure that appropriate appointments for physiotherapy and speech and language therapy are made . also needs to be considered at this stage . Unpredictable fluctuations . However, over a period of years, the fluctuations can become increasingly unpredictable . Unpredictable motor fluctuations are especially disabling, as patients begin to lose confidence in their ability to go out, resulting in increasing social isolation . Unpredictable motor fluctuations are probably linked to unpredictable and often delayed gastric emptying . Although patients can still improve with adjustments to their oral medications, this usually only offers limited control . Advanced therapy . Advanced Parkinson's disease . Mid-stage Parkinson's disease leads on to an advanced stage of disease associated with a range of motor and non-motor functional consequences . In some patients, the final stages of Parkinson's disease may involve the development and delivery of palliative care . This can result in increasing motor disability and complications such as frequent falls . Patients should be reassured that regardless of when their Parkinson's disease developed (fifth, sixth or seventh decade), these complications do not tend to occur until patients enter their eighth or ninth decade, so not all patients will reach this stage of Parkinson's disease . Treatment of this stage of the disease remains the greatest challenge in the modern era . Treatments that can provide some maintenance or enhancement of quality of life are available, but the therapeutic options for many symptoms are limited . Patient education . Patients should be encouraged to learn about their condition . Patient support groups can help with this (see Useful resources, pages 161 -) . Gentle but accurate explanation of what is happening is important so that both patients and carers maintain some sense of control . ","Patients may experience unexplained symptoms for years before diagnosis: prodromal non-motor symptoms, such as impaired sense of smell, constipation and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, develop in the majority of patients. Care must be taken in delivering the diagnosis. It is best if the patient is accompanied by a spouse, partner or other family member, and information may need to be repeated 2-3 weeks later when the shock has subsided. It is important to address both non-motor and motor symptoms, and to treat both social and motor disability. Early treatment is important; quality of life deteriorates in those who delay treatment. Maintaining an active lifetyle, both physically and mentally, is important. All patients will eventually experience motor (and often non-motor) fluctuations, with a 'wearing off' of the benefit of their initial medication. Patients should be reassured that the increasing motor disability and complications of late-stage Parkinson's disease do not tend to occur until the eighth or ninth decade of life; not all patients will reach this stage of Parkinson's disease."
9781910797426,ch09,"Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory process of the pancreas that leads to irreversible functional and morphological destruction of the pancreas . The pathological features of chronic pancreatitis are . Several theories explain the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis, although none is perfect . About 50% of patients develop pancreatic exocrine and endocrine deficiency some 20 years after disease onset, and about 80% experience pain . Features include . avoidance of fat . Pancreatic endocrine failure . Features include . Causes of pain . The pain of chronic pancreatitis is multifactorial in origin, but modern theories principally relate to nerve alterations (Figure 9.2) . The number and diameter of intra- and interlobular nerve bundles in pancreatic tissue is increased . Pain may be increased as a consequence of local complications such as pseudocysts and biliary tract or duodenal obstruction . Pain is also associated with the inability to digest fat properly (malabsorption) . Older theories include increased intraductal pressure and compartment syndrome . Blood tests . Liver tests may indicate biochemical biliary obstruction . Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a highly sensitive test for chronic pancreatitis in moderate to severe form (Figure 9.3); a normal EUS correlates well with the absence of chronic pancreatitis . A pancreatic pseudocyst should be differentiated from a pancreatic cystic tumor . Positron emission tomography may not reliably distinguish chronic pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer . Medical treatment . The factors governing appropriate fat digestion are complex (Figure 9.7) . Other medical treatments include . treatment of diabetes . Patients with intermittent pain appear to have a more favorable disease course . The American Gastroenterological Association has produced guidelines for the management of pain, which can be quite problematic (Figure 9.8) . Endoscopic treatment . There may be little effect on pain and the techniques do not influence the development of pancreatic insufficiency . Drainage of the biliary tree . Choice between endoscopic and surgical drainage relies on patient comorbidities and compliance with repeat endoscopic procedures . Drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts . Many pseudocysts resolve spontaneously (Figure 9.9) or transpapillary technique (during ERCP) . Relatively simple pseudocysts without parenchymal disease are most suitable for endoscopic treatment . Surgical treatment . Pancreatic duct drainage procedures . Pain relief is moderate to good in 80% of patients in the short-term, but only 50-60% of patients are pain free at 5 years . There is little effect on pain in patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis . Drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts . The indications for surgical internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts include . pseudocysts with complex or multiple main pancreatic duct strictures . pseudocysts with a main bile duct stricture . Biliary stricture occurs in 6% of patients and duodenal obstruction in 1% . Pancreatic resection achieves the best results for intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis . Long-term pain relief is achieved in 70-95% of patients, but there is a still a mortality of 1-3% . The outcome is better if patients have not been long-term heavy users of opioid analgesia . Complications of chronic pancreatitis include . abdominal mass - mass-forming pancreatitis, pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis, pseudocysts or pancreatic cancer . jaundice due to biliary obstruction . vomiting due to duodenal obstruction . abdominal distension due to pancreatic ascites . Many patients lose the support of their friends and family or their employment, especially if the pancreatitis is associated with alcohol consumption . Earlier diagnosis and referral to pancreas treatment centers . Genetic counseling and intervention in patients with hereditary and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis . Drugs that will modify the progression of the disease . Genetically engineered insulin-producing cells . Effective secondary screening for pancreatic cancer . More effective pain control measures . Further refinement of endoscopic and surgical techniques . ","The diagnosis must be clearly established by radiological, endoscopic and/or functional tests. Risk factors such as smoking and alcohol should be discouraged. Medical measures must be optimized. Beside medical treatment, severe pain may need endoscopic or surgical intervention.

9781905832729,ch_6,"The likely causes of bladder outlet obstruction are listed in Table 5.1 . The most common cause in men is benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) secondary to hyperplasia and in women, pelvic organ prolapse (POP), with kinking of the urethra . The patient may present with a variety of storage and voiding symptoms . The term BPE indicates benign prostatic enlargement, usually due to BPH, while BPO indicates benign prostatic obstruction, a common cause of bladder outlet obstruction . Microscopic BPH is seen in about 25% of men aged 40-50 years, 50% of men aged 50-60 years, 65% of men aged 60-70 years, 80% of men aged 70-80 years and 90% of men aged 80-90 years . It is estimated that 25-50% of men with microscopic and macroscopic BPH (BPE) will develop lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPO . However, far fewer men complain about these symptoms than of BPH, and even fewer seek help because of these symptoms . The cause of BPH is not fully understood . Posterior urethral valves are a congenital cause of bladder outlet obstruction in boys, which, if severe, can lead to hydronephrosis and renal failure . The risk is increased in patients with sexually transmitted diseases, repeated episodes of urethritis or BPH . Primary bladder neck obstruction is thought to occur as a result of congenital constriction, or failure to open that is not associated with the urethra . It is characterized by incomplete opening of the bladder neck during voluntary or involuntary voiding . It is found almost exclusively in young and middle-aged men, and is characterized by long-standing storage and voiding symptoms . These men typically have normal-sized prostate glands, and objective evidence of obstruction is easily obtained on urodynamic examination . Once obstruction is diagnosed, it may be located to the bladder neck by videourodynamic investigation . Secondary bladder neck obstruction may be caused by posterior urethral valves, and results from hypertrophy of the bladder neck muscle in response to increased voiding pressure caused by the urethral abnormality . Symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction vary . The most common symptoms associated with bladder outlet obstruction are listed in Table 5.2 . Examination and investigations . Some men with BPH will have some degree of renal impairment . There is some debate about whether the measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be mandatory . Measurement of urinary flow rate is an extremely useful investigation in patients with voiding dysfunction . The reduced flow rate characteristic of prostatic outlet obstruction is shown in Figure 2.4 . Once obstruction has been diagnosed, videourodynamic investigation can be useful to determine the site of the obstruction . Urodynamic studies are not indicated for all men suspected of having BPH . Bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic obstruction . The aim of treatment is to relieve the obstruction by reducing the smooth muscle tone or bulk of the prostate . They act by relaxing the prostate and bladder neck smooth muscle, reducing outlet obstruction without adversely affecting detrusor contractility . Surgical treatment of BPH has the best results in terms of improvement in symptoms and urine flow rates, but is associated with a much higher incidence of complications than medical treatment . Transurethral resection of the prostate (Figure 5.2) is the most common surgical treatment for BPH . Symptom relief is achieved in 70-90% of men . Transurethral incision of the bladder neck and prostate is used when a patient has obstruction caused by a prostate that is relatively small (generally less than 35 g), with a high bladder neck and no hyperplasia of the middle lobe . Laser ablation of the prostate is an alternative to transurethral resection . Open prostatectomy is indicated only in men who have extremely large prostates . Primary bladder neck obstruction . Although alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists provide some relief in patients with bladder neck dysfunction, definitive relief is best achieved in men by bladder neck incision . Surgery should be carried out with caution in the rare woman with primary bladder neck obstruction, as the risk of postoperative urinary incontinence after bladder neck incision is high . Voiding problems . Bladder outlet obstruction may occur at any point along the length of the urethra from the bladder neck to the urethral meatus . ","Voiding problems occur when normal smooth emptying of the bladder is impeded, through obstruction or impaired detrusor contractility. Benign prostatic enlargement secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a process of normal aging in men, is the most common cause of outlet obstruction. In women, pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can cause obstruction. Rarer causes include posterior urethral valves, urethral stricture and bladder neck obstruction, which may be congenital or secondary to increased voiding pressures as a result of urethral abnormality. Uroflowmetry and urodynamic investigations are useful in the diagnosis of outlet obstruction but are not indicated for all men thought to have BPH. Transurethral ultrasonography and measurement of postvoid residual volume may also provide useful information. Videourodynamic investigations can be helpful in women with POP and suspected obstruction. Obstruction due to BPH can be treated with alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. Surgery (transurethral resection, vaporization or incision of the prostate) may be needed. Surgery is often required for bladder neck obstruction and urethral stricture."
9781910797815,chp8,"A specific approach to the management of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) may be required in certain patient populations, such as women and children, and in particular situations, such as splanchnic vein thrombosis or surgery . MPNs in women: influence of sex on phenotype . Epidemiology studies suggest that the outcome of MPNs differs between men and women . Other studies have reported higher rates of splanchnic vein thrombosis (see below) and cerebral vascular thrombosis in women than in men . Importantly, MPNs affect women at any stage of life and hence present specific challenges with respect to contraception, pregnancy and the menopause . Combined oral contraceptives are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, and are not recommended for women with any MPN . Table 8.1 presents the potential complications of pregnancy in women with MPNs . The most common maternal complication was pre-eclampsia, which occurred in 3.4% of women . Similar findings have been reported in women with PV, while a study of eight women with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) reported a live birth rate of 50% . Potential risk factors for thrombosis and other adverse outcomes in pregnancy are listed in Table 8.2 . While there are no validated predictors of outcome in pregnancy, previous thrombosis or hemorrhage and extreme thrombocytosis are considered to be risk factors for adverse outcomes in women with MPN . An algorithm for the management of pregnancy in women with MPNs is shown in Figure 8.1 . There are few data on the safety of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women with MPN . Although estrogens are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, one retrospective study found that the use of estrogen-based HRT was not associated with an increased risk of major thrombotic events in women with MPN . MPNs in children . There is currently no risk stratification system for children with MPNs because of a lack of long-term data . Phlebotomy is recommended for asymptomatic patients with PV, and low-dose aspirin may be considered for teenagers with PV who have outgrown the risk of Reye's syndrome . Cytoreductive therapy should be used only as a last resort in high-risk patients . Few cases of PMF have been reported in children . Splanchnic vein thrombosis . Splanchnic vein thrombosis (also known as abdominal vein thrombosis) is common in MPNs, occurring in approximately 15% of patients, and may include . extrahepatic portal vein occlusion . mesenteric or splenic vein thrombosis . The clinical presentation of these conditions varies . The symptoms of acute mesenteric vein thrombosis resemble those of acute portal vein thrombosis, although chronic thrombosis may be asymptomatic . MPN may not be readily clinically apparent in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis because abnormal blood cell counts may be masked by concurrent splenomegaly, hemodilution, gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency . In fact, splanchnic vein thrombosis may be the first clinical sign of MPN . In a 2012 meta-analysis, MPN was present in approximately 41% of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome and 32% of those with portal vein thrombosis . Treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis requires a multidisciplinary approach including hematologists, gastroenterologists or hepatologists, thrombosis experts, interventional radiologists and surgeons . Elective surgery . Given the risks of thrombosis and bleeding associated with MPN, patients undergoing surgery require careful management; however, data to inform treatment decisions in this setting are limited . For example, a recent systematic review identified only three studies of surgery in patients with ET, and there are no evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with ET undergoing elective surgery . Similarly, retrospective studies indicate that surgery is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients with PV (Figure 8.2), but prospective data are lacking . The following recommendations have been made for the management of surgical patients with PV and can be generalized to other MPNs . All patients should be monitored for bleeding and thrombotic events during the postoperative period . ","Combined oral contraceptives are not recommended for women with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) because of the risk of thrombosis. MPN increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including early fetal loss and pre-eclampsia. Antithrombotic therapy for pregnant women at risk of vascular complications consists of aspirin, possibly with phlebotomy in women with polycythemia vera. Low-molecular-weight heparin and cytoreductive therapy with interferon (IFN)-alpha may be considered in women at high risk of complications. Hormone replacement therapy should only be used in perimenopausal women with no other risk factors for venous thromboembolism or a history of thrombosis. There is currently no risk stratification specifically for children with MPN, although a history of life-threatening venous or arterial thrombosis should be considered high risk, warranting cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea or IFN-alpha) The treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis requires a multidisciplinary approach. All patients should receive long-term anticoagulant therapy, and patients with thrombocytosis require cytoreductive therapy; some patients may require invasive intervention. There are few data to inform treatment decisions in patients with MPN undergoing elective surgery. Best practice indicates optimizing blood counts and a clear plan for anticoagulants."
9781910797617,chp5,"Accurate prognostication is important when considering the risk versus benefit associated with different approaches to treatment (chemotherapy, novel targeted therapies, allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplant [alloHCT]), which are associated with different levels of early treatment-related mortality and risk of relapse . Prognostication requires evaluation of the following . pre-treatment risk based on . cytogenetic and molecular analysis . post-treatment parameters: measurable residual disease (MRD) monitoring . Multiple studies have established age as an important and independent adverse risk factor; in particular, older patients (> 60 years) have dismal outcomes with conventional treatment . Table 5.1 summarizes data from a retrospective analysis of the combined adverse effects of older age and poor performance status on mortality risk . Performance status and comorbidities should also be considered alongside age when deciding on the intensity of treatment to offer older patients with AML . Comorbidities affect the morbidity and mortality risks of treatments and therefore inform treatment choices . Patients may also develop consequences of AML that influence the treatment strategy, such as severe sepsis . Cytogenetic and molecular signatures . Cytogenetics and the molecular signature have become the cornerstone of risk stratification in AML . The risk groups based on karyotyping used by the cooperative groups (Cancer and Leukemia Group B, SWOG and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) are illustrated in Table 5.2 . Prognostic assignment differs slightly among North American and European groups but the basic premise is shared . The ELN has recently revised the risk stratification groups for AML on the basis of the genetic abnormalities detected by conventional karyotyping and molecular techniques (see Table 2.4) . Many of these mutations are context specific in both their occurrence and impact on clinical outcomes . ASXL-1 mutations occur more commonly in older patients and are also associated with poor prognosis . NPM1 mutation is associated with a good prognosis only in the absence of other high-risk mutations such as FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3 -ITD) with high allelic ratio . Molecular markers can be used within the cytogenetically defined risk groups to further refine the prognostic risk, and may even be useful in deciding the optimal consolidation therapy, as illustrated in the following two scenarios . In the large cohort of patient with cytogenetically normal karyotype, mutation analysis in NPM1 and FLT3 can help distinguish three subsets . NPM1+ / FLT3 -ITD− (without adverse-risk genetic lesions) is associated with good prognosis; consolidation with chemotherapy alone may be considered, as for a cytogenetic favorable-risk group (note that the ELN 2017 update includes FLT3 -ITD with a 'low' mutated to wild-type ratio [< 0.5] in this group) . NPM1+ / FLT3 -ITD+ is associated with intermediate risk . NPM1− / FLT3 -ITD+ may be considered as high risk; allogeneic HCT may therefore be offered at first complete remission (CR1) . The impact of these combinations on event-free and overall survival has been shown by a retrospective analysis of two consecutive AML Study Group trials, as illustrated in Figure 5.1 . Within the cytogenetically favorable-risk group, the presence of a KIT mutation is associated with poor prognosis and may therefore identify a subset of favorable-risk patients for whom allogeneic HCT can be considered in CR1 . The identification of novel markers beyond prognostication may also help identify subsets of patients who may benefit from therapies with specific molecular targets . Similar targeted therapies are being evaluated for IDH1, IDH2 and KMT2A mutations, as discussed in Chapter 6 . Patients who do not achieve CR after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy are considered to be at high risk for relapse . The presence of MRD after completion of induction and consolidation chemotherapy despite morphological remission has significant prognostic implication . Despite these challenges, several studies have established the role of MRD in the accurate prognosis of outcomes when performed after induction and consolidation therapy and before alloHCT . MRD monitoring is uniquely beneficial for high-risk APL patients in CR1 . Detection of rising MRD has been shown to accurately predict relapse . Studies are currently investigating whether intervention based on such information can improve clinical outcomes in AML . ","Accurate prognostication is important when considering the risk versus benefit associated with different approaches to treatment. The World Health Organization system classifies patients' 'risk' based on molecular pathology. Age is an important and independent adverse risk factor, and older patients (> 60 years) have particularly dismal outcomes with conventional treatment. Age and certain cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities increase the risk of multidrug resistance to chemotherapy. Understanding of the molecular genetics of acute myeloid leukemia has increased in the last decade, and several mutations, either alone or in combination, have been shown to have a significant bearing on prognosis. European LeukemiaNet includes these genetic abnormalities in its risk stratification. Molecular markers can be used within the cytogenetically defined risk groups to further refine the prognostic risk and may influence the choice of consolidation therapy. The presence of measurable residual disease after induction chemotherapy indicates a high risk of relapse."
9781908541963,chapter9,"The use of ultrasonography in the investigation of abdominal symptoms and abnormal liver function tests has greatly increased the detection of benign liver lesions (Table 9.1), although the lesions identified are often not relevant to the issue under investigation . Because the detection of focal lesions in the liver can precipitate considerable anxiety until they are characterized as benign, appropriate investigations are warranted and occasionally therapeutic intervention is indicated . The key questions to be answered about the lesion are . The characteristics of the more common benign lesions are summarized in Table 9.2 . Lesions are considered to be benign if the dimensions and characteristics of the lesion(s) remain constant during that period . It is not uncommon for individuals to have a combination of benign lesions . Benign liver tumors . Hemangiomas are the most common of all the benign focal lesions and are present in at least 1% of the population . Hemangiomas are most commonly found near the capsule of the right lobe . Classic lesions can be diagnosed with a high degree of confidence with any of the radiological techniques, but occasionally complex lesions require extensive investigation . Focal nodular hyperplasia is the most frequent of the benign solid liver tumors and is most commonly encountered in women during their reproductive years . The typical lesion is solitary, measures 3-5 cm in diameter and has a characteristic central scar that may be visualized on scanning . Unlike adenomas, there is no risk of rupture or malignant transformation and these lesions do not need specific therapy . Adenomas are rare - about 300 are diagnosed annually in the USA - but are the most clinically relevant of the benign tumors . Unlike focal nodular hyperplasia, these lesions have the potential to grow, hemorrhage and rupture . The last two complications may present with severe abdominal pain . Simple cysts are common and are found in 2.5% of the population . Most are asymptomatic unless very large or complicated by infection or hemorrhage into the cyst . Defenestration or surgical removal are alternative therapies . Polycystic liver disease may occur in isolation or in association with polycystic kidney disease . Some cases are associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis . These cysts can also be complicated by hemorrhage and infection . Pain or jaundice are the most common presenting symptoms, typically in young adults . Surgical resection may be required . Infections and abscesses . Pyogenic liver abscesses are discrete pockets of infection within the substance of the liver tissue . There are two patterns of abscess: multiple small abscesses distributed throughout the liver, and larger discrete abscesses, which have a predilection for the right lobe . The latter are readily apparent on scanning the liver, but small abscesses may be difficult to detect . Drainage of larger abscesses is achieved percutaneously or surgically and is the mainstay of treatment . Despite effective drainage, protracted periods of antibiotic therapy are required to eradicate the infection . Antibiotics are the only effective therapy for the smaller, diffuse pattern of infection . The impairment of perfusion that follows hepatic artery occlusion renders antibiotic therapy ineffective, and retransplantation is usually required . The initial infection may be associated with a diarrheal illness . Discomfort in the right upper quadrant and fever are the main presenting symptoms . The abscess can usually be detected on ultrasonography and is most frequently found in the right lobe . Most cases respond to therapy with metronidazole or tinidazole; drainage or surgery are reserved for difficult cases . Symptoms, usually subtle, include fever and abdominal pain . The cysts are detected on ultrasonography or CT and often have characteristic 'daughter cysts' attached to the wall of the dominant cyst . Percutaneous aspiration of the cysts is not advised . Initial management is with mebendazole or albendazole but many cases will require surgical resection . Cholangitis is infection in the biliary tree and is usually associated with an obstruction to bile flow (exempli gratia stone in the common bile duct, benign stricture or malignant disease) . The classic triad of symptoms is . fever and rigors . Cholecystectomy is indicated in patients with gallstone disease . ",Benign liver lesions are relatively common. Most lesions identified are unrelated to the symptoms under investigation. Hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasia are managed conservatively. Adenomas are closely linked to hormone therapy and require surveillance and occasionally surgical resection.
9781908541963,chapter12,"About 6000 liver transplants are performed annually in both the USA and Europe . After transplant, most patients enjoy long-term survival and dramatic improvements in quality of life . Many patients with advanced liver disease, however, are not candidates for liver transplantation, in part due to the limited supply of donor organs . Indications and contraindications . Liver transplantation may be a viable option for patients with advanced liver disease of almost any etiology . In the USA, the most common indications for transplantation resulting from chronic liver disease are viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (Table 12.1) . Severe liver disease that has resulted from acute disorders may also require liver transplantation (Table 12.2) . Timing of liver transplantation . Referral criteria for acute and chronic liver disease differ . Acute liver failure is defined as the rapid development of jaundice and encephalopathy in a patient with no history of liver disease . Acute viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury are common causes . Criteria have been developed to aid clinician referral of patients with fulminant hepatic failure (Table 12.5) . In general, patients with acute liver disease complicated by encephalopathy should be transferred to a liver transplant center for continued observation and preparation for transplant if needed . With regard to chronic liver disease, it is best to select patients for liver transplant whose survival would otherwise be dramatically limited . It must be noted, however, that advanced liver disease itself causes systemic changes that may limit the success of liver transplantation . Thus, the clinician must select patients who are most in need of liver transplant, and are likely to survive the procedure . The Child's score (Table 12.6) predicts survival for patients with advanced cirrhosis . Patients with a score greater than 7 are likely to benefit from consultation at a liver transplant center . In interpreting the MELD score in hospitalized patients, the 3-month mortality is . TABLE 12.6 Determination of Child's score, used to predict the survival of patients with severe cirrhosis . Patient has well-maintained liver function and excellent expected survival . Reduced survival . Transplant centers use the MELD score to prioritize patients awaiting liver transplant . Acceptable patients should be referred when the MELD rises above 10-12 . A similar score for pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD score) is also available . Currently, recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is almost universal and about one-third of patients get aggressive liver disease . The antiretrovirals also appear to have reduced the need for liver transplantation in these patients because of liver failure, although hepatocellular carcinoma continues to be a common indication . Transplantation for patients with ALD remains controversial . Survival of patients with ALD following transplantation appears to be comparable to that of transplant patients with non-alcoholic liver disease . Most transplant centers require at least 6 months' abstinence before consideration for liver transplantation . Living donor liver transplant (LDLT) . Long-term management of liver transplant recipients . The number of liver transplants being performed annually worldwide is in the region of 15-20 000 . Liver transplant recipients require long-term immunosuppression, although they tend to be less aggressively immunosuppressed than recipients of other solid organ transplants . effects of individual immunosuppressive drugs . Long-term immunosuppression increases the risk of opportunistic infections and malignant disease (Table 12.7) . Vaccination against influenza is recommended for liver transplant recipients and should reduce the incidence of influenza in these patients . Opportunistic infections should be considered if . However, diarrhea may also be the presentation of an opportunistic infection . This is the most common non-cutaneous malignant disease after liver transplantation and can present at any time . Immunosuppressive drugs . All of the immunosuppressive drugs have potential side effects (Table 12.8) . Disease recurrence . Many liver diseases have the potential to recur after liver transplantation (Table 12.9) . Dietary restrictions pertinent to chronic liver disease (exempli gratia salt or protein restriction) no longer apply . Dietary adjustments are needed in patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia or hypertension . ","Liver transplantation is effective for a wide range of liver diseases. Thorough assessment is mandatory and must cover physiological, social and psychiatric comorbidity. Many diseases recur after transplantation, but with variable consequences. Careful attention to the complications of immunosuppression is of great importance; possible opportunistic infections, drug interactions and side effects can occur. Limitations to lifestyle after transplantation are remarkably few."
9781910797082,ch03,"Although diagnosis is relatively straightforward, a number of other dermatological entities may be confused with psoriasis (Table 3.1) . Drug-induced rashes . Lichen planus . The Koebner phenomenon (see page 25) is found in lichen planus, as in psoriasis . Certain clinical forms of lichen planus (exempli gratia palmo-plantar, genital) are difficult to differentiate from psoriasis, especially in darker skin . Diagnosis is usually by clinical examination supported, if necessary, by skin biopsy . Skin cancers . However, these neoplasms usually occur singly or are fewer in number, are never symmetrical and do not show the classic silvery scale of psoriasis . If localized psoriasiform lesions fail to respond to traditional topical therapy, this diagnosis should be considered and a skin biopsy performed . In its early stages, when patches or plaques are apparent, this condition may closely resemble psoriasis . In flexural areas, peripheral pustules are characteristic of Candida infection . Tinea, or ringworm, is an infection caused by a dermatophyte fungus and may sometimes be mistaken for psoriasis . Tinea capitis is ringworm of the head . Although a minor degree of hair thinning is not uncommon in established cases of psoriasis, well-demarcated areas of hair loss (Figure 3.1) and signs such as the 'black dots' or fractured hair shafts characteristic of tinea infection are highly unusual in psoriasis . In addition, tinea capitis seldom shows the classic silvery scale of psoriasis . Tinea corporis affects the body (Figure 3.2) . Lack of symmetrical lesions, presence of peripheral scale and central clearing are all more characteristic of tinea than of psoriasis . Tinea cruris affects the groin area, and is characterized by central clearing with an advancing edge . The lesion has a non-silvery, fine scale, particularly at the periphery, and frequently extends more on the left than the right side . Tinea pedis is ringworm of the feet . In the vesicular form, clear vesicles are noted (in contrast to the whitish-yellow pustule of psoriasis; see Figure 2.6) . In the 'dry moccasin' variety of tinea pedis, a relative lack of symmetry is seen . Tinea manum is ringworm of the hands . It presents as a fine powdery scale, particularly involving the palms and palmar creases . Again, it is usually asymmetrical . Tinea unguium infection of the nails may be extremely difficult to distinguish from psoriatic nail involvement, particularly in toenails . A search for nail pits and clinical evidence of cutaneous psoriasis or tinea of the feet is important . Secondary syphilis . The guttate (drop-like) forms of psoriasis may mimic secondary syphilis . Therefore, it is important to search carefully for a primary syphilitic lesion, together with associated lymphadenopathy, mucosal lesions and palmar-plantar lesions with a peripheral collarette of scale, which are characteristic of secondary syphilis . Eczema/dermatitis . Discoid eczema . Individual patches are usually more pruritic, lack a silvery scale and are less likely to show the more vivid, characteristic purplish-red color of psoriasis (Figure 3.3) . Hand and foot eczema . Hyperkeratotic forms of eczema, particularly in atopic patients, may be identical in appearance to psoriasis . Taking a skin biopsy to differentiate it from psoriasis is rarely helpful . Clues to the diagnosis include a history of atopy (hay fever and/or asthma), a lack of psoriasis elsewhere on the body, and evidence of eczema elsewhere on the skin . Clinically, psoriasis is usually more clearly demarcated than eczema, even on the palms and soles . A history of atopy, including asthma, allergies or rhinitis, will frequently exclude psoriasis . In addition, the lack of classic psoriatic nail involvement is important . Contact dermatitis is seldom symmetrical and is more pruritic than psoriasis, particularly in the early stages . ","Various dermatological disorders can resemble psoriasis, including other inflammatory dermatoses, infections and neoplasms. Medical and family history and physical examination, along with laboratory findings, are all important in establishing the correct diagnosis."
9781910797105,ch01,"Early descriptions . Descriptions of symptoms associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia date back to preclassical cultures . These were considered to be the manifestations of supernatural forces invading the individual, often as punishment for immoral behavior . In ancient Greece and Rome, the focus for studying mental illnesses moved towards a naturalistic standpoint . Early Greek physicians described delusions of grandeur, paranoia and deterioration in cognitive functions and personality . These were attributed to disturbances among the four bodily humors: blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm . In Western cultures, the Renaissance led to a re-emergence of interest in classical thought, with a reawakening of the conceptualization of mental illnesses, including psychoses, as naturalistic disorders . The first European psychiatric hospitals were established during this period . Organic etiologies of mental illness were adopted, and the initial descriptions and classifications of these disorders were attempted . Developments in classification . In the first part of the 19th century, the foundations for the modern concept of schizophrenia were established (Table 1.1) . An early diagnostic system emerged and various mental illnesses were described, including epilepsy, melancholia, mania and the dementing psychotic disorders, which included schizophrenia . However, the system lacked a general approach that could integrate the diverse manifestations of mental illness into distinct clinical syndromes . The situation was complicated by the overlap in the clinical presentation of these disorders . Furthermore, the clinical presentation of an individual could change over time, and patients with the same symptoms could have different outcomes . Two developments led to the eventual delineation of schizophrenia from the other dementing psychoses . First, the limitations of cross-sectional descriptions of symptoms for classifying mental disorders led to the emergence of a new system based on unified causes, clinicopathological correlations and the longitudinal course and prognosis of presumed disorders . The other development was the identification of the spirochete as the causal agent in general paralysis of the insane (GPI) (Figure 1.1), a common form of insanity in the 19th century . Its symptom manifestations were diverse and overlapped extensively with the symptomatology of schizophrenia . The identification of GPI as a syphilitic insanity helped Emil Kraepelin (Figure 1.2) to delineate the two other major patterns of insanity: manic-depressive psychosis and dementia praecox (or dementia of the young: schizophrenia), and to group together under the heading of dementia praecox the previously disparate categories of insanity, including hebephrenia, paranoia and catatonia . In differentiating dementia praecox from manic-depressive disorder, Kraepelin emphasized the early onset and what he believed to be the inevitable deteriorating course of dementia praecox, compared with the relatively good outcome of manic-depressive illness . Kraepelin also described what he thought were the two main pathological processes in patients with schizophrenia . The former process corresponds to our current concept of the negative symptoms, and the latter to the positive symptoms, of schizophrenia . In 1911, Eugen Bleuler (Figure 1.3), recognizing that dementia was not a necessary characteristic of dementia praecox, suggested the term 'schizophrenia' (splitting of the mind) for the disorder . Bleuler believed that schizophrenia represented a syndrome consisting of several disorders that shared a common psychopathology . He also introduced the concept of primary and secondary symptoms of schizophrenia . His four primary symptoms (the four 'A's) were abnormal associations, autistic behavior and thinking, abnormal affect and ambivalence . Of these four symptoms, Bleuler viewed as central to the illness the loss of association between thought processes and that between thought, emotion and behavior . Since Kraepelin and Bleuler there have been relatively few modifications of the description of schizophrenia . Karl Jaspers advanced the idea of precise phenomenology to describe mental symptoms accurately . The diagnostic categories of schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder were introduced in the 20th century, but these categories largely represent refinements in the boundary between schizophrenia and the affective disorders . Current views . Currently, schizophrenia has the status of a syndrome, a characteristic collection of symptoms that result from multiple genetic and environmental causal pathways . These pathways produce disorders of normal brain function that give rise to positive and negative symptoms, cognitive impairments and functional disabilities . These manifestations and their long-term course are used to differentiate schizophrenia from other forms of psychosis (see Chapter 2) . Whether schizophrenia is best viewed as a dimensional disorder, on a continuum with mood disorders, continues to be debated . ",Schizophrenia was first clearly identified in the 1890s. Its characteristic features were an early onset and a chronic course. Kraepelin described two characteristic psychopathological processes. Bleuler introduced the concept of primary and secondary symptoms.
9781908541024,ch_10,"The location of a skull base tumor strongly influences clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and management . Table 9.1 lists the important tumors arising from specific regions of the skull base . Pathologically, skull base tumors can be classified as benign, of intermediate malignancy or highly malignant . A classification of skull base tumors by biological behavior is presented in Table 9.2 . Using these imaging techniques, it is often possible to diagnose skull base tumors preoperatively with considerable certainty . Management in general . The management options for skull base tumors are surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or combinations thereof, or careful observation with close follow-up . However, regular follow-up with imaging is then necessary to monitor tumor progression . Hence, surgery is most often offered to patients with progressive symptoms . It can be curative if benign skull base tumors are resected completely . Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has been used to control benign tumors such as meningiomas and paragangliomas, as well as to provide palliative treatment for malignant tumors . Pituitary tumors . Pituitary adenomas are the third most common type of primary intracranial tumor (after gliomas and meningiomas), accounting for 10-15% of all such tumors . These patients typically present at a younger age with larger tumors . Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 60 years; younger patients are more likely to have a tumor that actively secretes a hormone . Headache is the most common neurological symptom . However, lifelong therapy is required because most patients will have recurrent symptoms and tumor growth if the dopamine agonist is discontinued . Surgery is appropriate for patients with resistant tumors and for those unable to tolerate medical therapy, or simply for patient preference . Surgery is also undertaken to allow pregnancy without risk of tumor growth and to avoid the unknown risk of medications to the fetus . Surgery is the initial treatment of choice . Radiotherapy may be necessary in patients with recurrent or refractory tumors . Radiographically, these tumors are usually very small microadenomas . Resection is curative; most failures result from inability to find the tumor . Further surgery and radiotherapy may control symptoms . Elevation of the glycoprotein alpha subunit in 80% of patients distinguishes these tumors from primary thyroiditis . A combination of surgery and radiotherapy is often necessary to control these tumors . Somatostatin analogs may be used in patients with refractory tumors . Surgery is indicated to preserve or restore both neurological and endocrinological function in patients with large or symptomatic tumors . Attempts to use chemotherapy have generally been disappointing, but medical management of secreting tumors may provide some palliation . Craniopharyngiomas are low-grade tumors that arise in the suprasellar region . Radiotherapy can be used for patients with recurrent or inoperable tumors . Stereotactic radiotherapy provides excellent control in patients with inoperable or high surgical risk tumors . The tumor recurs in approximately 25% of patients undergoing a gross total resection . Schwannomas account for 6-8% of all intracranial tumors . The goal is to achieve total resection of tumor with preservation of cranial nerve function . Larger tumor size is associated with increased surgical morbidity, and increased risk of radiotherapeutic failure . Schwannomas that are associated with this disorder are reported to be more aggressive and invasive than sporadic tumors . These tumors develop more commonly in women, and can arise at any age . Multiple tumors or a familial occurrence is noted in 10% of cases . Radiotherapy can control most tumors when there is recurrence or tumor progression following surgery . A minority of patients have CNS symptoms . Esthesioneuroblastomas can be slow-growing tumors, but their behavior is unpredictable . Chordomas and chondrosarcomas are uncommon tumors arising from bone . These tumors are managed with surgery and radiotherapy . Skull base tumors . Skull base tumors are neoplasms that arise from or involve theskull base . This chapter reviews the most common primary skull base tumors and discusses the principles of management in general and, in more detail, the management of pituitary tumors . ","Symptoms arise from involvement of cranial nerves, compression of brainstem or basal cerebral structures, and obstruction of the pharynx, middle ear or nasal cavity. Surgery can be curative if benign skull base tumors are resected completely. However, there is a relatively high risk of operative morbidity. Radiosurgery is an increasingly accepted alternative to surgery for small tumors in surgically high-risk areas. The goals of therapy for pituitary tumors include: reversal of endocrinopathy; elimination of mass effect with preservation or restoration of neurological function (particularly vision); and prevention of recurrence. Patients with prolactinomas should be managed medically; most other pituitary adenomas require surgery, with or without radiotherapy. Endocrine consultation is critical in the initial assessment and ongoing management of all patients with pituitary region tumors (adenomas, craniopharyngiomas and germ cell tumors). Particle-beam radiation can achieve long-term control of growth for radioresistant skull base tumors such as chordomas and chondrosarcomas."
9781910797426,ch08,"There are several theories for the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, all of which are controversial . Other theories include . gallstone migration . The disease quickly resolves in 75% of patients, but in the other 25% the attack is severe . Unlike chronic pancreatitis, once the patient has recovered from an attack of acute pancreatitis there may be complete resolution of symptoms and a return to normal anatomy and physiology . Up to 10% of patients have necrosis of the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, which continues for several days, with variable evolution towards persistence or disappearance, remaining sterile or becoming infected . Predicting severity . It is important to determine as early as possible (within the first 3 days of symptom onset) whether the attack of pancreatitis is likely to be mild or severe . acute pancreatitis (includes mild acute pancreatitis; no organ failure, no local or systemic complications) . moderately severe acute pancreatitis (transient organ failure, local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure) . severe acute pancreatitis (persistent organ failure over 48 hours) . One or more of the following methods may be used . Pancreatitis severity is usually stratified into mild, moderate and severe, based on the extent of inflammatory changes, fluid collections and necrosis seen in CT scans . It was modified into the CT severity index by including grading of necrosis extent . Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) above 150 mg/L indicates a severe attack, but the peak is not reached until 72 hours after symptom onset . The Ranson score includes 11 criteria variously applicable at 24 and 48 hours, and separate systems for alcohol- and gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis . Medical treatment . The essential requirements are as follows . Overviews of the management for mild and severe attacks are given in Figures 8.3 and 8.4, respectively . Mild acute pancreatitis . Severe acute pancreatitis . Patients with a severe attack have persistent organ failure (over 48 hours from onset) and will need to be managed on an intensive care unit . Patients may also require two or more of the following . but are not recommended for prophylactic use in severe acute pancreatitis, even in the presence of sterile necrosis . Endoscopic treatment . ERCP is usually not indicated in mild or moderately severe acute biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis or CBD obstruction . Surgical treatment may be required in necrotizing acute pancreatitis if infected necrosis is present or suspected (based on clinical deterioration or prolonged organ failure) . The principal purpose of surgery in severe acute pancreatitis is the removal of necrotic pancreatic tissue (necrosectomy) . Thus, from day 7 of a severe attack, all patients must undergo a contrast-enhanced CT scan, repeated at 7-10-day intervals until there are signs of clinical improvement . However, a severe SIRS response will promote systemic complications that lead to multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) . Acute peripancreatic fluid collections are common in acute pancreatitis, even in mild acute pancreatitis . Initially the necrosis is not infected (sterile pancreatic necrosis); however, infection can develop and this is associated with increased morbidity and mortality . Infected pancreatic necrosis is a secondary infection of sterile pancreatic necrosis and develops in the later phase in 40-70% of patients with severe disease . The infected necrosis acts as a major focus of infection, leading to septicemia and amplification of SIRS and MODS . The overall mortality in this group of patients is 20-40% . Systemic complications . The assessment of several organ systems should be included . Likely systemic complications of acute pancreatitis include the following . Central nervous system disturbances, including coma . Follow-up . There are no long-term sequelae following recovery from mild acute pancreatitis . In severe necrotizing pancreatitis, however, there are significant late complications in up to 60% of patients . These include . Thus, long-term follow-up is required to monitor the development of these complications . Improved and earlier detection of infected pancreatic necrosis . Better results from minimally invasive pancreatic necrosectomy . Drugs that will modify the progression of mild to severe acute pancreatitis . ","An urgent CT scan of the abdomen should be performed if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Prognostic evaluation for the severity of the disease should be completed within the first 3 days of symptom onset. It should be determined whether gallstones are the cause of the attack; if so, urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy should be performed in severe cases; all cases of acute biliary pancreatitis usually require cholecystectomy. If severe acute pancreatitis with extensive necrosis is found beyond the first week, fine needle aspiration for bacteriology and fungi should be performed; if there is proven infected necrosis, pancreatic necrosectomy might be required. If the etiology is uncertain, endoscopic ultrasonography should be performed following resolution of the attack to exclude unusual causes of obstruction such as small stones or tumors."
9781908541680,ch_3,"However, the system that resists a decrease in fat stores is considerably more sensitive than the one that resists an increase in fat mass . Hence, in a permissive environment, or with poor lifestyle choices, fat mass gradually increases . Regulation of energy balance and fat mass . Weight loss leads to increased appetite and energy expenditure falls . Overfeeding results in decreased appetite and energy expenditure increases . However, the system that resists a decrease in fat stores is considerably more sensitive than the one that resists an increase in fat mass . Hence, in a permissive environment, or with poor lifestyle choices, fat mass gradually increases . Regulation of energy intake involves an afferent system, a central integrating system and an efferent system . Afferent system . Small decreases in plasma glucose can trigger hunger but increases in plasma nutrient levels are probably not directly important in the regulation of appetite . Leptin also has peripheral metabolic effects that promote energy utilization . The regulatory systems are exquisitely sensitive to a fall in plasma leptin levels, which occur in response to caloric restriction even before a decrease in fat mass . Central integrating system . Effector system . Various factors may increase resting energy expenditure, including thyroid hormone, growth hormone and activation of the sympathetic nervous system . Physical activity level . Energy expenditure can vary substantially depending on the level of habitual physical activity . The physical activity level is the energy cost of physical activity, expressed as a multiple of 24-hour BMR . An expert panel of the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) suggested that a physical activity level range of 1.50-1.55 represented sedentary individuals . NEAT has a high degree of heritability and may be an important defense against obesity . Thermic effect of food . Protein intake increases the thermic effect of food to a greater extent than equivalent amounts of carbohydrate or fat . Approximately 40% of the thermic effect of food is believed to be mediated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system . The thermic effect of food decreases with weight loss - an effect that persists in the post-obese state, thereby promoting weight regain . The 'obesogenic' environment . A decline in activity was possibly the major feature of the early rise in obesity levels in the 1960s to 1980s . It is therefore unlikely that decreased energy expenditure has fuelled the obesity epidemic . Persistent organic pollutants have been associated with obesity and obesity risk factors - so-called endocrine disrupters such as dioxin-like chemicals and pesticides . 'Obesity genes' . Individual 'obesity genes' are described periodically in the scientific press, but each has little relevance in the clinician's struggle against obesity . Prenatal maternal or paternal obesity, dietary patterns and even stress may result in changes to the genes of offspring that may predispose to obesity . The offspring, and possibly the grandchildren, of an obese mother or a mother who chooses a poor lifestyle in pregnancy, will already be predisposed to obesity at birth . Indian immigrants have been shown to experience increased levels of weight gain and obesity after entering the UK, and African American women have higher fat intake and less physical activity than their white counterparts . The nature of the built environment may also be an important factor in limiting both physical activity and food choice . An individual is particularly susceptible to weight gain and weight-related complications at various significant stages of life . The causes and issues relating to obesity in children are discussed in Chapter 9 . Adolescence also represents a time of increased autonomy and changing behavioral patterns - irregular meals, changed food habits and prolonged periods of inactivity, combined with physiological changes that promote increased fat deposition, particularly in girls . Co-habiting and meal sharing with a partner may also lead to increased energy consumption . Repeated pregnancies may also induce long-term weight gain . Hormonal changes and decreased physical activity may be responsible, although the exact process is not fully understood . The causes and issues relating to obesity in the elderly are discussed in Chapter 9 . In developed countries obesity used to be linked with wealth, but in the 21st century obesity is now closely linked with deprivation . People who have quit smoking are also predisposed to weight gain . Sleep restriction (less than 6 hours a night on a regular basis) has been associated with a predisposition to obesity in both children and adults . The use of very bright LCD screens before sleep may increase sleep latency and decrease sleep duration . ","Physiological and genetic influences that promoted survival of our ancestors now promote obesity and comorbid disease. Genetic influences act alongside environmental factors to promote obesity. Transformation of our food habits has been a key factor in the increase of obesity and diabetes: energy-dense processed food is readily available in bigger and cheaper portions than ever before. Most causes of adult obesity are within the grasp of an individual to control, but babies and children rely on their parents and carers to provide an appropriate environment. Iatrogenic causes of obesity should be considered. The effect on weight of managing comorbid conditions is important, particularly diabetes in which weight gain is potentially catastrophic."
9781908541468,ch_3,"The clinical symptoms of renal disease often do not become apparent until kidney failure is advanced . Screening for renal disease is, therefore, particularly important, because it may enable abnormalities to be detected in time for effective treatment to be started . Bedside urine analysis is an essential part of any clinical examination . Urinary abnormalities will be found in most patients with renal disease, particularly positive dipstick tests for blood or protein, or the presence of cells, casts, crystals or organisms on urine microscopy . Heavy proteinuria can produce unusually frothy urine, but this is not often reported spontaneously . Proteinuria may originate from anywhere within the urinary tract . High levels of protein in the urine (> 3 g/day) generally reflect the presence of albuminuria and point to a glomerular process (glomerular albuminuria) . Proteinuria due to tubular damage is usually only low level (< 1 g/day) and involves proteins of a lower molecular weight, such as beta2-microglobulin . One of the most common causes of low-level proteinuria is inflammation in the lower urinary tract, which is usually caused by urinary tract infection (UTI) (Table 1.1) . Urinary protein excretion increases during pregnancy, but never to more than 300 mg/day, so overt proteinuria is not physiological . Dipstick testing of the urine is designed to detect albumin and is insensitive to other proteins; it will not, therefore, generally detect light chains in myeloma . Proteinuria may be formally quantified using timed urine samples, usually a 24-hour specimen . The upper end of the normal range is 150 mg/24 hours . Whereas significant albuminuria often indicates intrinsic renal parenchymal disease, hematuria may be caused by lesions throughout the urinary tract, particularly infection or malignancy (Table 1.2) . In general, once UTI has been excluded, then hematuria without significant proteinuria should prompt a search for malignancy in older patients, while hematuria with proteinuria requires a search for a glomerular cause . Red-cell casts, in particular, generally indicate active glomerulonephritis . In most cases, significant albuminuria in addition to hematuria is seen in glomerular disease . Kidney function tests . Serum creatinine in pregnancy . No fall in serum creatinine during pregnancy can indicate significant renal functional impairment . Measurement of glomerular filtration rate . Creatinine clearance, which assesses creatinine excretion over 24 hours in relation to the serum creatinine level, is often used as a measure of GFR . It is also important to realize that a significant rise in serum creatinine does not occur until the GFR is reduced to about 50% of normal . Other blood tests . The diagnosis of many renal diseases is assisted by specific blood tests, particularly in glomerular disease . It should be noted that in pregnancy, glycosuria is common and does not usually indicate diabetes or even impaired glucose tolerance . Kidney imaging . The investigation of renal disease should always include some form of kidney imaging, which can provide both anatomic and functional information (Table 1.5) . Kidney biopsy . Percutaneous kidney biopsy can provide a definitive histological diagnosis of glomerular or interstitial disease . It is particularly helpful in patients with severe proteinuria, hematuria that is not due to disease of the lower urinary tract, and acute kidney failure thought to be caused by intrinsic renal disease (rather than prerenal disease, obstruction or acute tubular necrosis [ATN]) . The main diseases diagnosed by kidney biopsy include glomerulonephritis, glomerular disorders such as amyloid and diabetes, and interstitial nephritis . If both kidneys are small, as in chronic glomerulonephritis, then the risk generally outweighs the benefit . In the presence of microscopic hematuria alone, or albuminuria of less than 1 g/24 hours, kidney biopsy is often not indicated since it is unlikely that a specific treatment would be required . However, higher levels of albuminuria or the combination of albuminuria and hematuria (particularly with casts) are indications for biopsy, because a number of causes of glomerulonephritis (see Chapter 6) and interstitial nephritis are now amenable to therapy . ","Proteinuria and hematuria should always be investigated. Proteinuria should be quantified by means of an albumin:creatinine ratio or 24-hour collections, since the result will guide management. Hematuria may have a medical or surgical cause, and this should be assessed before starting investigations. Serum creatinine alone is an unreliable guide to kidney function; an assessment of glomerular filtration rate is more useful. No fall in serum creatinine during pregnancy can indicate significant renal functional impairment."

It is the responsibility of every team member to inform each other, as well as appropriate family members, of the patient's state . Together, the team decides what type of treatment is necessary along the continuum of care . inpatient care . residential care . The interventions used in treatment need to be developmentally appropriate . As this is a complex multifactorial group of disorders, caregivers must anticipate long-term care, as treatment may require months or even years . The primary care physician, throughout treatment, has several important functions . to diagnose and treat any chronic and/or acute symptoms and complications . to monitor the patient's physiological status, including shifts in weight, blood pressure, pulse and other cardiovascular parameters . to continually reappraise the patient's physical state in order to confront any denial . to inform other members of the treatment team and appropriate family members of the patient's physical state . The psychiatrist/psychotherapist also plays an important role throughout treatment . In one treatment model, the psychiatrist or psychotherapist solely manages the psychological needs of the patient; in another model, the psychiatrist manages both the general medical and psychological needs, with specialized assistance from a psychotherapist . to assess eating-disorder symptoms and behaviors . to monitor the patient's psychological status, including behavior shifts, cognitions, and emotions . The dietitian oversees the nutritional counseling of the patient, providing several important functions . to improve dietary variety . Treatment goals . The ultimate goal of treatment is both psychological and physical health . The psychological aspects of treatment can be divided into three levels . interrupting pathological food-related behaviors . The medical aspect of treatment involves monitoring for common complications such as . gastrointestinal symptoms . cardiac symptoms . oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea . side effects of psychopharmacological agents . Acute problems of eating disorders include . Chronic problems include . impaired acquisition of peak bone mass . Management of complications . Weight gain is important for the restoration of menses; 86% of patients who achieve 90% of their ideal bodyweight resume menses within 6 months . Low bone density . Osteopenia is the most serious, potentially irreversible complication of the low estrogen levels caused by prolonged amenorrhea . In osteopenia, the level of markers of bone formation decrease and those of bone resorption increase . During adolescence, individuals develop 60% of peak bone mass; very little bone mass is accumulated from 2 years after menarche . Again, weight gain is crucial as an increase in BMD relies primarily on bodyweight . Patients who achieve more than 85% of their ideal bodyweight show significant improvement in spinal bone mass . Hormone replacement therapy has not been shown to be effective at increasing bone mass in the treatment of eating disorders . Weight gain is vital to improving bone mass . Gastrointestinal symptoms . The following gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with eating disorders, particularly during the weight-restoration phase . As fear of eating and weight gain is characteristic of these patients, it may be difficult to distinguish between psychological distress and actual physical discomfort . Aggressive treatment is not necessary because these symptoms are adaptive and tend to resolve as normal eating patterns are established . However, the following medications can be prescribed to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms . Cardiac symptoms . low-voltage complexes . This symptom is adaptive and will resolve with weight gain . Inpatient admission may be needed for . cardiac monitoring . Side effects of psychopharmacological agents include . increased risk for suicide ideation . menstrual irregularity/amenorrhea . Follow-up . Ongoing monitoring is driven by . drug and dietary control of medication abuse . In the weight-restoration phase patients should be seen weekly . As patients achieve weight gain beyond the 85% ideal, and approaching 100%, they can be seen less frequently and monthly visits may suffice . When patients are asymptomatic and weight is restored, follow-up visits can be as infrequent as once or twice a year for 4 years after onset, as this is the period in which patients are generally considered vulnerable to relapse . ","The treatment of eating disorders requires a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, involving the primary care physician, psychiatrist and nutritionist. The ultimate goal of treatment is both psychological and physical health. Psychological health comprises: healthy eating behaviors with no restricting or purging; the elimination of obsessions regarding body image, bodyweight and food; normal adaptive functioning in school/work and interpersonal relationships; and coping with normative stressors. Physical health is measured by the restoration of ideal bodyweight and return of menses. There are many complications, acute and chronic, associated with eating disorders that require ongoing management. Weight gain is crucial in order to restore menses and increase bone density."
9781910797495,chp3,"The most complex and treatment-refractory cases may require advanced pain medicine procedures and intensive pain rehabilitation programs to optimize pain control, function and quality of life . Research evidence to support the effectiveness of this approach to chronic pain treatment is just emerging . Effectiveness of interdisciplinary treatment . For example, for patients with chronic low back pain, cognitive and behavioral treatments such as positive reinforcement of healthy behaviors, modification of patients' understanding of their pain and disability, and graduated progressive physical therapy, all decrease pain intensity and improve functional status . For example, behavioral treatment for chronic low back pain has a moderate effect on pain intensity, functional status and behavioral outcomes compared with being on a waiting list or simply receiving no treatment . It is therefore not surprising that nutrition and behavorial management of weight can play an important role in chronic pain . Although patients may obtain short-term relief from their pain with passive options such as massage or chiropractic manipulation, there is no long-term reduction in pain . The pharmacological options for chronic non-cancer pain and cancer pain overlap substantially . However, there are also particular separate issues for chronic cancer pain (as discussed in Chapter 9) . The pharmacotherapy of pain is currently hampered by . a lack of drugs with selective action on targets of relevance to pain . Opioid-induced hyperalgesia may limit the long-term effectiveness of these drugs in some patients with chronic pain . Many published studies of analgesic drugs only evaluate patients for 12-16 weeks, covering in many cases the duration of acute or subacute pain rather than chronic pain . For chronic non-cancer pain . After a 'tight-fisted' attitude to the use of opioids for both chronic non-cancer and cancer pain, there was a large positive swing toward the use of these drugs in the 1980s for cancer pain and in the 1990s and 2000s for chronic non-cancer pain . Defining which group of patients with chronic non-cancer pain may benefit from the long-term use of opioids is a challenge . gov/guidelines/Pain/cot), provide a detailed discussion of the risks and principles for safe opioid prescribing in pain management, the tapering of opioids and informed consent . avoiding opioids as a first-line treatment . Furthermore, since chronic pain is an independent risk factor for suicide, patients with depression are at risk for an overdose of medication, no matter the opioid dose provided . Unilaterally stopping opioids in such patients without adequate pain control may worsen depression, hopelessness and the risk of suicide . For chronic cancer pain . Meperidine should be avoided except in extreme situations in patients with any form of chronic and cancer pain . Increasingly, for patients with substance use disorder whose pain requires opioids for control, experts are turning to buprenorphine for safer pain management . Effect size . The need for high doses of opioid from the start of therapy suggests an opioid-resistant pain mechanism (exempli gratia neuropathic pain) . Therefore, there are valid concerns about decisions to withhold opioids in cancer pain or to restrict necessary dose increases . Risk of addiction . The risk of addiction in patients receiving opioids for the first time for medical purposes, such as the treatment of cancer pain, is very low (see also Chapter 2) . However, patients with addiction problems do develop cancer pain and chronic non-cancer pain and require special management . Breakthrough pain describes a typically brief episode of pain above a baseline pain intensity that is controlled by a long-acting or by-the-clock opioid . This allows patients to obtain prompt relief while avoiding lingering opioid effects once the pain intensity has returned to baseline . Patients in need of analgesics for chronic pain should therefore be informed of the risks, and the lowest effective doses should be prescribed for the shortest appropriate duration . Effect size . Bisphosphonates are useful for the relief of pain due to bone metastases . Drugs used for treatment of neuropathic cancer pain . Drugs used for the treatment of neuropathic non-cancer pain . It is approved in the USA for morphine-resistant pain . Only about 40% of suitable patients respond to SCS with only approximately a 40% reduction in pain . SNS is gradually being used more for pain conditions such as perineal pain, bladder pain ('interstitial cystitis') and pelvic pain (exempli gratia pudendal canal stenosis) . Patients with chronic pelvic pain are often in extreme pain that is unresponsive to all treatments . ","As chronic pain is a multidimensional interdisciplinary biopsychosocial condition, expert consensus and some research recommends a selective, interdisciplinary, mechanism-based approach as the method of choice to restore quality of life and functionality. The specific disciplines of healthcare providers required to offer a multidisciplinary approach depend on the variety and complexity of patients seen and the available resources, as outlined in the stepped care model. Most pain care will occur in primary care settings, but ideally with close support from interdisciplinary teams of relevant health practitioners (exempli gratia psychology, physical therapy, complementary and integrative medicine) including pain medicine and other relevant specialists. The education of patients about their pain conditions, enabling their participation in shared decision-making and the development of self-management skills, is now considered a cornerstone of successful pain management, whether it is delivered at home, in primary care or specialty care settings. Research evidence to support the effectiveness of the selective, interdisciplinary stepped approach to chronic pain treatment is not yet conclusive; more research is needed to prove its cost-effectiveness in specific pain phenotypes. Pharmacotherapy of chronic and cancer pain is mostly multimodal, combining several different drugs that act on different targets. Pharmacotherapy is often combined with other treatment options. Opioids play a major role in cancer pain but data for their long-term effectiveness in chronic non-cancer pain are limited. There is substantial variation among patients in dose-response and side effects for individual drugs within a drug category. Thus, careful drug titration is required for each individual patient."
9781910797006,ch01,"In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pathological changes occur in the central conducting airways, the peripheral airways, the lung parenchyma and the pulmonary vasculature (Figure 1.1) . Current concepts suggest that inflammation induced by cigarette smoke underlies most pathological lesions associated with COPD . The inflammation damages lung structures, and individuals who are unable to repair this damage develop tissue alterations and functional compromise . Inflammation also contributes to recurrent exacerbations of COPD, in which acute inflammation is superimposed on the chronic disease . There is now good evidence that all smokers develop lung inflammation; however, some individuals are more susceptible to the effects of cigarette smoke and are more severely affected . The extent of the pathological changes in the different lung compartments varies between individuals and results in the clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity seen in patients with COPD . Some believe that chronic asthma should be included as part of the spectrum of COPD . Although the clinical and physiological presentation of chronic asthma may be indistinguishable from that of COPD, the pathological changes are distinct from those in most COPD cases due to cigarette smoking . Histological features of COPD in the 15-20% of patients who are non-smokers have not been well studied . Chronic bronchitis . In smokers, however, goblet cells are not only present in increased numbers but also extend more peripherally . Studies have reported increased numbers of neutrophils in the intraluminal space in patients with stable COPD . Some patients with COPD, however, have a T helper cell (Th)2-type inflammation, similar to that present in asthma . Neutrophils are present, particularly in the glands, in most patients with COPD, and become more prominent as the disease progresses . Nevertheless, some patients have minimal inflammation . A subset of COPD patients with eosinophils in their sputum has been described; these patients are more responsive to inhaled glucocorticoids . Small-airways disease/bronchiolitis . With severe disease, the number of small airways is reduced . Pulmonary emphysema . Emphysema is classified by the pattern of the enlarged airspaces on the cut surface of the fixed inflated lung (Figure 1.4) . Periacinar emphysema is now a recognized emphysema pattern in smokers . It can be associated with pneumothorax . Bullae are localized areas of emphysema that are overdistended . In around 20% of cases the surrounding lung is normal, but most bullae are associated with more generalized emphysema and chronic airway obstruction . The vasculature of the lung may be affected in several ways . The development of chronic alveolar hypoxia in patients with COPD results in hypoxic vasoconstriction of the small pulmonary arteries and, consequently, an inflammatory response in the arteries similar to that in the lungs . As a result, early in COPD the intima may become thickened, followed by an increase in the amount of smooth muscle and infiltration of the vessel wall with inflammatory cells . Right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension are common in patients with advanced COPD who have chronic hypoxemia . The pathological changes in patients with COPD are complex and may occur to varying extents in the large and small airways, and in the alveolar compartment . Consistent with this, decreased airway circumference correlates well with airflow limitation, as does reduced numbers of small airways in patients with moderately severe COPD when assessed on specimens removed surgically . Emphysema leads to decreased expiratory airflow by different mechanisms . Hyperinflation reduces the inspiratory capacity so that the functional residual capacity increases, particularly during exercise . Enhanced inflammatory response . The normal inflammatory response in the lungs to the inhalation of irritants, such as cigarette smoke, appears to be enhanced and abnormally persistent in patients with COPD . Altered structural cell function . Structural cells obtained from the lungs of patients with COPD have been shown to manifest persistently altered functions when cultured in vitro, perhaps as a result of epigenetic modifications . Lung cells have increased sensitivity to apoptosis, mediate repair functions less well and produce increased amounts of inflammatory mediators . The altered function of structural cells may account for the persistence of inflammation and progression of COPD, once established, even if cigarette smoking is stopped . ","COPD results from pathological changes in the large and small airways (bronchiolitis) and in the alveolar space (emphysema). Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as the production of sputum on most days for at least 3 months a year over at least 2 consecutive years. Inflammation occurs in large and small airways, and in the alveolar space, most commonly involving a number of cells including neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ lymphocytes. Small-airways disease or bronchiolitis can result in inflammation and eventually scarring of the small airways; this is an important pathological change in COPD, which is difficult to assess by respiratory function tests, but may be a major source of airway obstruction. Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema is the most common form of emphysema, particularly in smokers, and is distributed mainly in the upper zones of the lungs. Panacinar (panlobular) emphysema has a more diffuse distribution, predominantly in the lower zones of the lungs, and is associated with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; it can also occur in some smokers. Bullae are emphysematous spaces over 1 cm in diameter. Combinations of these pathological changes to varying degrees in different individuals with COPD contribute to the airflow limitation. The lungs of patients with COPD show an amplified and persistent inflammatory response to the inhalation of particles and gases, particularly those in cigarette smoke. A protease:antiprotease and oxidant:antioxidant imbalance is part of this amplified inflammatory response. Once COPD is established, the inflammatory process persists even after smoking cessation."
9783318066241,ch3,"In the emergency room, a CT scan is the most useful imaging test for diagnosing AP, followed by MRI; conventional ultrasonography is less reliable . CT/MRI to confirm the diagnosis of AP should be reserved for cases with atypical symptoms and/or those rare cases without an increase in pancreatic enzyme serum levels . AP may be present regardless of a normal CT scan, MRI or ultrasonography . abdominal pain consistent with AP (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain, often radiating to the back) . serum amylase or lipase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal . characteristic findings of AP on a contrast-enhanced CT scan or, less commonly, MRI or transabdominal ultrasonography . Most patients can be diagnosed on the basis of the first two criteria, with imaging required only in individuals with atypical symptoms or low serum enzyme activity . Signs and symptoms . Most patients with AP have a severe epigastric pain radiating to the flanks and/or back, together with nausea and vomiting . Exceptions are patients under immunosuppression or sedation and patients with dementia, in whom the diagnosis may be challenging . Jaundice is frequently seen in cases of persistent choledocholithiasis, or more infrequently in patients with compression of the bile duct due to inflammation and/or collections (in these cases the jaundice usually develops days or weeks after presentation) . Paralytic ileus may develop in some patients, and infrequently it may be persistent because of inflammatory or ischemic involvement of the bowel . Some patients with moderate-to-severe AP may develop reversible neuropsychiatric symptoms (exempli gratia delirium, hallucinations, convulsive and/or focal seizures) in the absence of organic triggers; this rare complication is known as pancreatic encephalopathy . Very infrequently, patients with AP may develop ecchymosis of the skin either periumbilically (Cullen's sign), on the flanks (Grey Turner's sign), on the inguinal ligament (Fox's sign) or in the scrotum (Bryant's sign) due to necrohemorrhagic pancreatitis from subcutaneous infiltration of inflammatory exudates from the retroperitoneum (Figure 3.1) . These signs have been linked with a poor prognosis . Other rare symptoms and signs of AP are the development of tender subcutaneous nodules (pancreatic panniculitis due to circulating lipase-induced digestion of subcutaneous fat) (see Figure 3.1) and loss of vision due to Purtscher retinopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome . Blood and urine tests . Most patients with AP have amylase and/or lipase serum activity greater than three times the upper level of normal . The amylase increase is first detected 2-12 hours after the onset of symptoms of AP; the level peaks at 12-72 hours and usually normalizes within 5 days . Serum lipase levels increase within 4-8 hours after the onset of symptoms; they peak at 24 hours, and return to normal after 8-14 days . The half-life of lipase is longer than amylase, so patients with a delayed presentation in the emergency room may show normal amylase activity with increased lipase activity . Urinary trypsinogen-2 and urinary amylase are also increased in AP . There is no evidence supporting the superiority of any one serum or urinary test over another in terms of accuracy . Hypertriglyceridemia (> 500 mg/mL) may be associated with falsely low levels of amylase and lipase activity . This is likely to be due to interference with the assay and so, in patients with lipemic plasma and typical symptoms of AP but unexpectedly low levels of pancreatic enzyme activity, the plasma can be serially diluted and the enzymes measured again, or imaging should be performed . Increased serum pancreatic enzyme activity may also be due to other conditions (Table 3.1 and Table 3.2) and about 1 in 10 patients may be wrongly diagnosed as having AP by blood or urinary tests . As indicated in Table 3.1, any cause of acute abdomen may be associated with increased enzyme activity in blood; in general, the more elevated the pancreatic enzyme activity level, the greater the specificity for AP . ","The most frequent presentation of acute pancreatitis (AP) is severe epigastric pain radiating to the flanks and/or back, nausea and vomiting. Most patients are diagnosed based on typical pain and increased serum pancreatic enzyme activity greater than three times the upper limit of normal. Diseases other than AP may be associated with increased pancreatic enzyme serum activity. Differential diagnosis is important as most of these conditions require specific treatment. Abdominal imaging is useful for confirming the diagnosis of AP in atypical cases, ruling out other conditions."

Autologous stem cell transplantation . In addition, the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) is low because the patient receives a transplant of their own cells . In intent-to-treat (ITT) studies, 40-73% of patients proceeded to transplant, while the remaining patients developed either progressive disease or comorbidities that precluded ASCT . In the longer term, 28 patients (18%) experienced disease relapse within 2 years and 11 (7%) patients experienced relapse beyond 2 years . Fifty-five of the patients (66%) proceeded to transplantation . Half of the patients (43; 52%) were alive at a median of 33 months' follow up . Three-year OS and PFS rates were 48% and 36%, respectively . Han and colleagues reported a retrospective analysis of ASCT in 46 Chinese patients . CR was achieved before transplant in 34 patients and PR in 12 . The 3-year PFS and OS rates for patients beyond CR1 were 42% and 53%, respectively . Multivariate analysis showed that ASCT was associated with superior OS for patients who achieved CR . Half the patients (n = 134) went on to ASCT (ITT) . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation . Choosing the right graft for a patient is an important consideration . AlloSCT in refractory/relapsed disease . The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 53% and 57%, respectively, and were influenced by disease status at the time of transplant . Survival rates in patients with different histologic subtypes are shown in Table 7.2 . Patients who did not achieve CR after alloSCT died within the 10 months' follow-up . Fifteen patients had relapsed disease and two had primary refractory disease . In two patients who had disease relapse after transplantation, a response was induced by the infusion of donor lymphocytes, confirming a GVL effect . The CIBMTR study has also published outcomes from a large cohort of heavily pretreated patients (n = 126; median age at transplant, 38 years) . In this ITT study, 29 of 49 patients (60%) proceeded to allograft . One- and 2-year OS rates after transplant were 76% and 72.5%, respectively and the TRM at 1 year was 8.2% . For patients who did not proceed to alloSCT, 2-year PFS was less than 30% . At the time of reporting, 16 of 23 patients were in CR, and seven had died (four from disease; three from toxicity) . Treatment should be informed by discussion and the preferences of the patient . One patient whose disease relapsed after alloSCT responded to immunosuppression withdrawal but ultimately succumbed to GVHD . These studies suggest that responses to induction therapy are poor in both Japanese and Caribbean patients with ATLL . Hence, alloSCT should be offered for fit and eligible patients in CR1 . At the time of transplant, 45% of patients were in CR, 30% were in PR and 12% had chemorefractory disease . The 3-year OS and PFS rates were 34% and 28%, respectively; no relapses were seen 2 years after transplant . Published literature are limited because of the rarity of the disease although a systematic review of transplant outcomes has been reported . A total of 54 patients were identified, with a median age at transplantation of 34 years; 94% had stage IV disease . Post-transplant outcomes data were available for 44 patients . The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation reported outcomes for 18 patients who underwent alloSCT: at a median follow up of 3 years, 2 patients had disease relapse post-transplant and the 3-year PFS was 48% . Before transplant, 40 patients were in CR and 2 were in PR . Twenty-one patients received alloSCT and 39 received ASCT (a higher proportion of patients in CR received ASCT) . This study demonstrates the potential of GVL in patients with high-risk PTCL even if CR or PR is not achieved before transplant . Complications of transplant . The risk of neoplasms appears to peak 5 years after transplant . Better understanding of disease biology may change this approach . ","Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as a consolidation strategy is an option for patients who achieve a complete response with front-line chemotherapy. Phase II studies have shown that about 40% of patients who undergo ASCT at first remission are disease free at 5 years. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) provides long-term disease control in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and as a front-line consolidation for patients with more aggressive PTCL subtypes. Complications from alloSCT include serious infections resulting from immune suppression, and chronic graft versus host disease. In a randomized study, outcomes were similar with upfront ASCT and alloSCT, with more patients in the autologous arm relapsing and more in the allogeneic arm experiencing transplant-related morbidity and mortality."
9781910797150,ch03,"As a result, major progress has been made in the treatment of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy . The acute phase of chemotherapy has been arbitrarily determined as the initial 24 hours after chemotherapy infusion, and the delayed phase defined as any time in the 96 hours after the acute phase (24-120 hours after chemotherapy) . International guidelines recommend that 5-HT RAs be given only on the day of chemotherapy . The oral dose is 1-2 mg/day . Efficacy in acute CINV . Granisetron has demonstrated significant activity in patients receiving both cisplatin and non-cisplatin treatment . Efficacy over repeated chemotherapy cycles . Efficacy over multiple-day chemotherapy cycles . The effectiveness of granisetron in the management of nausea and vomiting induced by multiple-day chemotherapy was evaluated in two comparative studies comprising 481 patients . Patients received their first course of chemotherapy (cisplatin, ifosfamide or etoposide) divided over 5 days . Granisetron was superior on day 1 in both trials . The efficacy of a single dose of intravenous granisetron, 40 μg/kg or 3 mg, was assessed in a multicenter study over a 7-day period, with 533 patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy (275 mg/m) . This alternative route of administration may be well suited for patients who are unable to take oral treatments, and has the potential of improving patient adherence to treatment . Efficacy in acute CINV . Acute nausea was less well controlled (complete control in 28% of patients) than acute emesis in this study and other trials conducted for similar indications . Efficacy over multiple-day chemotherapy cycles . Most early CINV studies reported poor control of delayed nausea and vomiting with ondansetron . The recommended dose is 5 mg intravenously or orally . The infusion is administered shortly before chemotherapy . Efficacy in acute CINV . Dose-finding studies demonstrated that tropisetron, 5 mg, provided total control of vomiting in up to 70% of patients during the first 24 hours after chemotherapy . Single oral or intravenous doses of dolasetron have shown efficacy in preventing acute CINV . The infusion is administered shortly before chemotherapy . Efficacy in acute CINV . The recommended dose is 0.25 mg intravenously or 0.5 mg orally . It may be advantageous in patients who cannot tolerate an oral formulation . Aprepitant is administered as three doses taken orally: 125 mg before chemotherapy on day 1, followed by 80 mg on days 2 and 3 . Fosaprepitant is administered as a 150 mg intravenous injection before chemotherapy on day 1 . All clinical trials with aprepitant have shown very good clinical activity for patients receiving HEC . The two trials evaluated 523 and 521 patients for efficacy and 568 and 525 patients for safety, respectively . A separate randomized trial compared 3 days of aprepitant plus day-1 ondansetron and 4 days of dexamethasone to 4 days of ondansetron plus dexamethasone in 489 patients receiving multiple-day HEC . Efficacy in AC-based chemotherapy . Special consideration should be given to aprepitant in patients receiving non-AC-based MEC . Rolapitant is administered as a single oral dose of 180 mg before chemotherapy on day 1 of treatment . Patients received oral rolapitant, 180 mg, or placebo before HEC administration . This effect continued over multiple cycles of treatment . Treatment was given before chemotherapy on day 1 . Patients in all treatment arms were given oral dexamethasone on days 1-4 . The 300-mg NEPA dose showed a numerical improvement over the lower doses . Efficacy in AC-based chemotherapy . Most patients were Caucasian women undergoing treatment for breast cancer . Some studies have evaluated ginger's potential in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea . However, more severe delayed nausea was reported by patients than acute nausea . The effect of CINV on patients' quality of life can be devastating, and patients who experience uncontrollable nausea and vomiting associated with their therapy may be reluctant to continue with additional chemotherapy . Proper administration of antiemetics reduces CINV and improves patients' quality of life, such that patients are more likely to undergo subsequent chemotherapy cycles . ","Serotonin (5-HT ) receptor antagonists (RAs) (ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, dolasetron and palonosetron) have their main antiemetic effect during the acute CINV phase. Neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, rolapitant and netupitant) have their main antiemetic effect during the delayed CINV phase. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone in particular) have a significant role in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed CINV, and are an essential part of almost all antiemetic regimens in clinical practice. A combination of a triple antiemetic regimen of a 5-HT RA, an NK-1 RA and a corticosteroid is very effective in antiemetic prophylaxis for patients receiving cispatin, AC (anthracycline and cyclophosphamide)-based and highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) regimens. Recent data have shown that a combination of a triple antiemetic regimen of a 5-HT RA, an NK-1 RA and a corticosteroid is very effective in the prophylaxis of moderately emetogenic chmeotherapy (MEC) regimens, in particular carboplatin-based treatment. 5-HT RAs, NK-1 RAs and corticosteroids are not very effective in the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea. Nausea control remains a challenge in the management of CINV."
9781910797693,chp3,"This totality of experience available with the original reference product can highlight issues such as immunogenicity or multiple potential mechanisms of action that will be critical in developing follow-on products . Manufacturers and regulators define quality according to critical 'quality attributes': chemical, physical and biological properties that need to be within agreed tolerances . Advances in analytical technology have permitted detailed characterization of the active ingredients in biologics . Importantly, for biosimilarity with a reference protein product, it is necessary to demonstrate that the amino acid sequence (primary structure) and higher order structure is the same . The upper and lower limits of the tolerance are referred to as the 'developmental corridor' (Figure 3.1); quality control monitoring of production batches by manufacturers ensures that the product reaching the patient is within the developmental corridor, such that a predictable effect can be expected . Once biosimilarity at a molecular level is established, it is confirmed through limited clinical trials (see Chapter 4) . Batches of biologics vary over time, and this is true for both the originator and biosimilar drug . Clinical studies of an originator drug to support different indications are likely to have been conducted with different batches . Indeed, it is possible that a biosimilar batch could more closely share critical attributes of that (originator) batch than the current batch . A change in the production process of a biological drug (originator or biosimilar) could affect outcomes . For this reason, manufacturing changes are regulated to ensure that new batches of product meet the defined critical attributes . The regulation of biosimilar production is based on the procedures developed to address changes to manufacturing of originator biologics . Biologic and biosimilar drug developers can determine the natural variation in the structure and biopotency of the reference drug from sequential batches of the drug . Variation in these attributes over time defines the limits of acceptable analytic differences that a regulator accepts between a reference drug and its biosimilar and so defines the development corridor for a biosimilar . In some circumstances, a biosimilar that has a notable difference in a critical attribute from the reference product may be permitted by regulators, as in the example of epoetin alfa: a biosimilar version is available that has a relatively high level of phosphorylated mannose-type structures (compared with the reference compound) . The European Medicines Agency accepted this difference on the basis that these structures are considered to be common glycoforms of recombinant erythropoietins and that their presence has been described in the literature for other recombinant cytokines and a large variety of non-lysosomal proteins from human plasma . The level observed did not affect the efficacy or safety . Immunogenicity is a potential safety concern with any biological agent, and even slight changes in structural properties or impurities could, in theory, trigger an adverse immune reaction . Product drift over time and evolution through manufacturing changes may produce structural differences in a reference biologic, meaning that no biologic can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . Immunogenicity cannot yet be predicted from analytic or animal studies with sufficient accuracy for biologic medicines . For this reason, clinical studies in humans remain a current requirement for biosimilar medicines (though not routinely required for a biologic drug undergoing a manufacturing change or small molecule generics) . Regulators are concerned to identify differences in toxic potential such as acute anaphylaxis or reductions in efficacy through the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies that increase the clearance of the drug . Immunogenicity is monitored both pre- and post-marketing . Biosimilars do not have to show that they have no immunogenicity - just that the levels are similar to those of the originator . Concerns about immunogenicity appear to be generally unfounded and, as discussed on page 63, European approved biosimilars have not been associated with any increase in the incidence of such adverse events . In contrast, documented immunogenicity differences with clinical impact have been reported for originator medicines undergoing manufacturing changes and with intended copy biologic drugs from less regulated medical regions of the world . Figure 3.2 illustrates immunogenicity data for biosimilar adalimumab and Humira . ","The quality attributes - chemical, physical, and biological properties - of a biologic must be within a development corridor that defines the acceptable upper and lower limits of the marketed product. The regulations were originally developed to cover variation in batches of biologics resulting from manufacturing changes, including procedures to ensure that batches of originator biologics were within the development corridor."
9781912776276,chp5,"In general, patients with slowly progressive psychotic symptoms without any somatic symptoms are unlikely to benefit from an evaluation for infection . Assessing non-PD dementia . Overall, the cortical pathology related to PD is the main cause of progressive cognitive decline in about 95% of people with PD who develop dementia . Changes in the people who populate the patient's environment may trigger similar problems . Medication review . When non-PD medications cannot be reduced further, the medications used for PD motor function need to be considered . Pharmacological treatment . Most of the atypical antipsychotic drugs have been used to treat PDP and have been the subjects of small clinical trials . Motor worsening, the main concern, was not reported, and there was an improvement in psychosis within a few days, sometimes overnight . Dosing and efficacy . Indeed, the outcome of both trials clearly indicated that clozapine was more effective for treating PDP than it was for schizophrenia or any other disorder . Improvement was evident within 1 week of drug initiation . Clozapine also has a beneficial effect on PD tremor and has been used to treat tremor that is otherwise drug refractory . Clozapine may cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome . Risperidone, which is primarily indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and disrupted and aggressive disorders in demented patients, was initially reported to be non-inferior to clozapine in the treatment of PDP, without motor worsening, but subsequent reports described severe motor worsening in patients with PD . It was therefore hoped that the drug would ameliorate psychosis without worsening parkinsonism . It has also been found to induce parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia in non-PD patients . It has produced conflicting results in patients with PDP . Quetiapine, which is approved for use in schizophrenia and psychosis associated with bipolar disorder and severe depression, has been reported in numerous open-label reports in people with PD to be an effective antipsychotic that does not worsen motor function (Case report 5.5) . Despite these trial results, many PD experts in the USA continue to use quetiapine for patients with PDP . Side effect profiles must always be considered when selecting drug treatments . Both drugs also carry the risk of orthostatic hypotension, a common problem for people with PD (Case report 5.6) . Specifically, antipsychotics confer a two- to fourfold increased risk of mortality in patients with PD, including comparison with matched groups of people with PDP taking or not taking antipsychotics . This should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time . The drug reaches steady state at 10-12 days for single daily dosing . Dosing and efficacy . In the phase III trial, 185 people with PDP were enrolled across 52 North American centers . Earlier trials . Recent open-label reports . A chart review from a different clinic reviewed 16 cases of PDP and 1 of DLB; 14 of the patients with PD also had dementia . Only 2 patients reported no benefit, and there were no significant side effects . The European study demonstrated better overall treatment response in people with visual hallucinations, but only one of the Japanese studies specifically reported the impact on psychotic symptoms, highlighting modest but significant benefit with donepezil treatment . Additional pharmacological treatment is usually required for more severe symptoms . Case series and open-label studies in people with PD treated with cholinesterase inhibitors report improvements in psychotic symptoms, - but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed . Antidepressants have been shown to improve psychotic symptoms in depressed patients with psychotic symptoms as well as patients with a history of depression and typical PDP symptoms . ECT has also been reported, albeit in rare case reports, to ameliorate PDP in patients with and without depression . Why ECT improves mood is unknown, as is the explanation for the improved motor function . Conversely, patients sometimes see the hallucinations better in the light . Patients with primary psychiatric disorders who develop PDP are a relatively small group . Depression and anxiety often arise in patients with PD, but also bipolar disease, for which patients may already be taking antipsychotic drugs . looking for medical problems that may be contributing to psychotic symptoms . Patients can usually be redirected to topics outside the psychotic focus . ","The first approach to treatment is to look for contributing factors such as infection, metabolic disorders or non-PD-related psychoactive medications. Only clozapine and pimavanserin have proven efficacy for Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). While clozapine works quickly, pimavanserin requires 4-6 weeks to improve psychotic symptoms. Although clozapine doses are one-tenth to one-hundredth of those used in schizophrenia, the risk of granulocytopenia and agranulocytosis is thought to be unchanged, so close blood monitoring is still required. Quetiapine is widely used (on the basis of open-label reports) even though there is no clear evidence of efficacy and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including mortality risk. Cholinesterase inhibitors confer overall benefits in people with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, with some evidence of a specific beneficial effect in the treatment of psychosis. Further work is needed to determine potential benefits of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment for PDP in the absence of dementia. Trials of novel pharmacological and psychological treatment approaches are now being initiated; this is likely to be an evolving field over the next 5 years."
9781912776139,ch1,"ALS is a syndrome that arises from a neurodegenerative disorder of the motor system and its associated neuronal networks . In relation to the most obvious symptom, ALS has understandably found itself historically classified among the neuromuscular disorders . 'Progressive' is the sine qua non of a diagnosis of ALS . It is reasonable to assume that, if untreated, ALS is always progressive, although the rate of spread of symptoms varies significantly between individuals . 'Painless' reflects the absence of prominent sensory involvement in ALS . 'Paralysis' is the extreme end stage of the secondary muscular weakness that lies at the core of ALS . The site of onset and pattern of spread of weakness in ALS varies but is not random . ALS results in progressive weakness of muscles beyond the site of the initial symptoms . Measuring progression . Like many other diseases, ALS has become increasingly challenging to define because of conflicting clinical, histopathological and, most recently, genetic taxonomies . by site of first symptom onset . by histopathological signatures . Despite attempts to define neurophysiological diagnostic criteria for ALS, the bedside clinical examination together with a compatible history of progressive weakness remains the gold standard for diagnosing ALS . However, it is important to recognize that ALS is a syndrome, with a spectrum of clinically apparent UMN and LMN involvement (Figure 1.4) . 'Progressive muscular atrophy' . While at least 70% of cases of 'typical' ALS have clinical signs of both UMN and LMN involvement, at one end of the spectrum about 20% of ALS cases are dominated by muscle atrophy without clinical signs of UMN involvement (Figure 1.5a,b) . The mean age of onset of PLS is around 10 years younger than for typical ALS, usually with lower-limb or bulbar dysfunction . PMA and PLS (id est clinically pure LMN and UMN forms of progressive motor weakness) are currently excluded from the diagnostic criteria for ALS (see page 86) . Individuals with so-called PMA have a similar functional decline to ALS . Thus, the term PMA is best avoided in favor of LMN-predominant ALS . PLS is a very rare condition and is frequently overdiagnosed in those who have UMN-predominant ALS . Classification by site of first symptom onset . Individuals with ALS are strikingly able to define the timing and site of onset of their first symptoms (Table 1.2) . The initial site of symptom onset typically retains the highest burden of progressive disability . The classification of ALS by the site of onset, typically spinal (limb) onset versus bulbar onset (see Figure 1.5b), reflects the often worse prognosis of those with bulbar onset . Classification by regional body involvement . There are several ALS phenotypes with strikingly limited physical regional involvement, initially at least (Figure 1.5c) . Flail arm phenotype . The most consistent feature is markedly slower progression (in contrast to more common cases of upper-limb-onset ALS); survival up to 10 years and beyond is quite common . Progression to anarthria is often quite rapid . Reports as early as the late 1800s noted rare but occasionally profound cognitive impairment in cases of otherwise typical ALS . Cognitive dysfunction is an adverse prognostic in ALS, so it is an important aspect of routine assessment in people with ALS, alongside their motor disability . Dementia tends to present early in the symptomatic phase of ALS, often just before motor symptoms become apparent . Only a small number of people with ALS have frank FTD; likewise, only a minority of patients develop major motor weakness secondary to FTD . Histopathological classification . As such, it is reasonable to consider the broad syndrome of ALS as a 'TDP-43-opathy' . Stratification by rate of progression . The major limitation of a unified TDP-43-based approach to the classification of ALS is the anatomic disconnection between the range of clinical phenotypes and rates of progression . Given that molecular taxonomies of ALS transcend or confound attempts to produce clinical criteria for these variants, supports the view that ALS is more usefully stratified in terms of rate of symptom progression rather than variable sites and patterns of symptom onset and spread . It is also one of the appealing aspects of a clinical staging approach to ALS akin to that in cancer (Table 1.3) . ","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not one disease, but a syndrome that overlaps with frontotemporal dementia. ALS is primarily a progressive motor-predominant syndrome. There is significant variability in the clinical evidence of upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The initial regional patterns of body involvement vary, but generalized involvement over time is the norm. Variation in the speed of symptom progression is not closely tied to any single phenotypic classifier. Symptom onset is focal and tends to spread contiguously. Neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions of transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43) are the consistent histopathological feature in nearly all cases."
9781910797105,ch11,"Since the 1970s psychosocial interventions have been a key part of the management of schizophrenia . At that time, the adverse effect of institutionalization on people with schizophrenia came to be realized, and this led to the increased development of community-based services . More recently, specific psychological techniques aimed at improving aspects of schizophrenia have also been evaluated (Table 11.1) . Family interventions . The concept of high 'expressed emotion' within families as an environmental predictor of relapse in schizophrenia was suggested in the 1960s by Brown and Rutter . Families who showed overinvolvement or excessive criticism were associated with high relapse rates in individuals with schizophrenia . Whether the high expressed emotion was the cause of the poor prognosis, or partly the effect of illness severity, has not been resolved . Nevertheless, family-based interventions aimed at enhancing coping strategies by education about the illness (Table 11.2) have been shown to improve prognosis . A meta-analysis of the best randomized controlled trials, with a collective total of 350 patients and their families, found that such interventions, usually delivered over 9 months, were both effective and cost-effective . Patients who had family interventions showed lower relapse rates and improved drug compliance . Families valued the treatment and experienced less burden of care . This effect appears to be enduring and can be delivered to groups of families, with some evidence that this is the most cost-effective method . Family support combined with individual psychological techniques has been shown to reduce relapse rates in schizophrenia complicated by substance misuse . Psychological treatment of positive symptoms . The idea that cognitive behavioral treatments that are effective in people with major depression might be effective in treating positive psychotic symptoms dates from the 1990s . Coupled with the failure of psychoanalytical treatments for schizophrenia in the 1950s and 1960s, this view left a legacy of skepticism about psychological approaches . Since the mid-1990s, however, randomized controlled trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective for persistent psychotic symptoms in chronic schizophrenia when given in addition to routine care (Case history 11.1) . The effect size is about the same as that for clozapine . Secondary analyses of these trials suggest that as important as the actual CBT is the patient-rated 'therapeutic alliance' - the positive feelings of the patient towards the therapist . Trials have also shown that these techniques, added to drug treatment, may improve outcomes for psychotic symptoms in acute psychosis, including first-episode schizophrenia . This is a technique developed from research in addictions, based on disclosing and working with an individual's incentive to change behavior . It has been adapted as a potential intervention for people with schizophrenia who are non-adherent to pharmacological treatment . Initial promising results in people with a dual diagnosis of schizophrenia and comorbid substance use have not been borne out . Cognitive remediation . Cognitive remediation involves processes such as repeated practice and scaffolding, a learning technique in which the therapist helps the patient to solve problems by providing support for aspects of the task that the patient cannot accomplish, while removing assistance in areas in which the patient is competent . These processes take place over days and weeks to train up key cognitive functions in chronic schizophrenia . It has been shown to deliver cognitive improvements that persist beyond the end of treatment, although generalization to improved functioning is more likely if an overall rehabilitation program is also given . Computer- and web-based cognitive remediation approaches are now available . Other non-drug treatments . People with schizophrenia should be supported in exploring other ways of managing their condition . Creative therapies (arts and crafts, music), nutritional supplements, horticulture, sporting activities and pet therapies have all be shown to be useful in building confidence, although there is no strong formal evidence of their effectiveness . ","Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered in addition to drug treatment reduces persistent positive symptoms. CBT can also abort relapses if targeted at early signs. Cognitive remediation is effective in reducing cognitive impairments, although generalization to global functioning is an issue."
9781908541666,ch_11,"It may also affect patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those who are treated with sulfonylureas or insulin . Hypoglycemia represents a considerable barrier to the goal of achievement of near-normal blood glucose levels in insulin-treated patients . It is feared by patients with diabetes treated with insulin and has the capacity to seriously disrupt their lives . The symptoms of hypoglycemia are listed in Table 10.1 . The initial symptoms of hypoglycemia are caused by sympathoadrenal activation . Such symptoms include sweating, shakiness, palpitation, anxiety and a sensation of hunger . Patients come to recognize their own hypoglycemic symptoms, which are often highly individualized . If hypoglycemia is not reversed promptly then patients may go on to develop symptoms due to neuroglycopenia (resulting from brain neuronal glucose deprivation) and these symptoms include behavioral changes, cognitive dysfunction and even seizures and coma . Less commonly, some patients may not experience initial sympathetic symptoms and present with neuroglycopenia, a complication known as hypoglycemic unawareness . Hypoglycemia unawareness is a potentially reversible situation with expert help . In people with type 1 diabetes, 2-4% of deaths have been attributed to hypoglycemia . People with type 1 diabetes experience symptomatic hypoglycemia on average twice per week, with significant disabling hypoglycemia occurring approximately once a year . Hypoglycemia is much less common in people with type 2 diabetes but frequently goes unrecognized . In the UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group, there was a low incidence of hypoglycemia in those taking oral hypoglycemic drugs, but an appreciable incidence in those on insulin therapy . The glucose threshold that triggers hypoglycemia in diabetic patients is different from that in people without diabetes . Hypoglycemia may be experienced at a higher plasma glucose threshold in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, while patients with tightly controlled diabetes may tolerate remarkably low plasma glucose levels without experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms . It is generally recommended that patients avoid having glucose concentrations below 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL), as frequent exposure to glucose levels below this threshold may result in the aforementioned phenomenon of hypoglycemic unawareness . Lack of awareness of hypoglycemia poses a hazardous situation for those who are driving or exposed to heavy machinery or other dangers . Hypoglycemia in diabetes is a consequence of absolute or relative excess of exogenously administered insulin or endogenous insulin secretion . The causes are shown in Table 10.2 . Death from hypoglycemia is rare, but it may follow excess alcohol consumption or deliberate insulin overdose . Occasionally, tragically unexpected deaths happen in young patients with type 1 diabetes; these often occur in bed and it has been speculated that they may result from hypoglycemia-induced cardiac dysrhythmias . Most episodes of hypoglycemia are self-treated and respond quickly to the ingestion of glucose tablets, fruit juices or a soft drink . As hypoglycemia may recur promptly, individuals are recommended to have a snack or meal once the initial hypoglycemia is corrected . When hypoglycemia is so severe that the patient is unwilling or unable to take anything orally, parenteral therapy is required . Partners, parents, relatives or close associates of people with type 1 diabetes should be taught how to inject the affected individual with glucagon, 1 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously (followed by the ingestion of carbohydrates to restore hepatic glycogen) . If 10% glucose is used, a larger volume will be required to correct the hypoglycemia . A 50% glucose solution is not recommended because of irritant damage to veins . Follow-up . In all instances it is important that efforts be made to identify the cause of hypoglycemia, particularly when it is recurrent or unrecognized by the individual, and to formulate a suitable course of action to prevent future hypoglycemic events . ",Symptomatic hypoglycemia is common in patients with type 1 diabetes. Hypoglycemia is a barrier to the achievement of tight glycemic control. Frequent hypoglycemia may lead to the development of hypoglycemia unawareness. There are many and varied causes of hypoglycemia. Death from hypoglycemia is rare.
9781910797426,ch07,"Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction . Disorders of the sphincter of Oddi may present as sphincter stenosis or dyskinesia . Sphincter of Oddi stenosis is an actual anatomic narrowing of the sphincter, caused by inflammation, pancreatitis, gallstone passage or other unusual causes . Sphincter dyskinesia on the other hand is a spastic functional disorder of the sphincter, the cause of which is poorly understood . Dysfunction mostly occurs after cholecystectomy, but it may occur in a patient with an intact gallbladder; this occurs more often in young women . The classification of the disorders of the biliary and pancreatic sphincters is described in Table 7.1 . Symptoms and signs include biliary-type pain and, in some patients, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may present as recurrent pancreatitis . Sphincter of Oddi manometry is the diagnostic gold standard . The biliary and pancreatic duct pressures are measured; an elevated basal pressure above 40 mmHg is diagnostic . Sphincter of Oddi manometry could be considered to confirm a diagnosis of type II biliary dysfunction . Medical treatment . Oral nifedipine has been found to relieve pain in patients who had previously undergone cholecystectomy, and who had elevated basal pressure and sphincter of Oddi phasic contractions of predominantly antegrade nature . Endoscopic treatment for all types of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction takes the form of biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy during ERCP . Patients with type I biliary sphincter dysfunction respond well to sphincterotomy, which can be performed without manometry of the biliary sphincter . Type III biliary dysfunction is the hardest to treat, and there is no clear consensus on or understanding of invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment with sphincterotomy or the existence of other contributing or alternative causes of pain . Pancreatic sphincterotomy may be undertaken if recurrent pancreatitis is considered to be related to pancreatic sphincter hypertension . Manometeric pressure abnormalities were not associated with the sphincterotomy outcome . This study mostly involved patients in the type III sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group . Based on this evidence-based study, some have suggested that sphincter of Oddi dysfunction type III is not a real disease and one should not pursue manometry or ERCP in these patients . Gallbladder dyskinesia . Gallbladder dyskinesia is a disorder caused by abnormal motility or contraction of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones . Surgical resection of a dysfunctional dyskinetic gallbladder reveals acalculous chronic cholecystitis in some patients . The pathogenesis is unclear but it is regarded as a motility disorder as patients frequently have other gastrointestinal motility disorders . Functional gallbladder disorder is a relatively new term used by some to describe gallbladder dyskinesia . This is a diagnosis of exclusion . Patients with other gastrointestinal motility disorders are likely to be at increased risk . An ejection fraction below 35-40% is considered abnormal and these patients are more likely to respond to cholecystectomy . In some patients the pain of gallbladder dyskinesia is reproduced when CCK is administered . Treatment is by cholecystectomy, usually laparoscopic . In patients whose gallbladder ejection fraction by CCK-stimulated scintigraphy is less than 35-40%, a significant number will experience improvement or resolution of pain following cholecystectomy . Before attempting cholecystectomy other diagnoses need to be eliminated as a cause for the patient's abdominal pain . Careful selection of appropriate patients for cholecystectomy must be undertaken . Treatment by cholecystectomy for this condition is controversial . Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and pain-causing mechanisms attributed to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction so far . Improved understanding of other diseases and mechanisms that cause pain similar to, or overlapping with, pain considered to be from sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and gallbladder dyskinesia/functional gallbladder disorder . ","Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may be due to anatomic stenosis or a spastic functional disorder, and is most common after cholecystectomy. A lot of controversy surrounds this topic. Data suggest that sphincterotomy is not more effective than a sham procedure in patients with type III dysfunction, leading some to suggest type III dysfunction may not be a real disease. Sphincter of Oddi manometry is the diagnostic gold standard for the dysfunction. Biliary or pancreatic duct pressure of more than 40 mmHg is diagnostic of biliary or pancreatic sphincter dysfunction, respectively. A low gallbladder ejection fraction of less than 35-40% on Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan with gallbladder stimulation may be diagnostic of gallbladder dyskinesia (functional gallbladder disorder), and is the best predictor of response to cholecystectomy. The pain of gallbladder dyskinesia is reproduced in some patients when cholecystokinin is administered."

9781910797273,chp2,"In contrast to gray matter, which contains neural cell bodies, white matter predominantly contains myelinated axon tracts . MS is characterized by the presence of multifocal lesions or 'plaques', predominantly in the white matter, which exhibit myelin destruction, perivascular inflammation and relative preservation of axons . It is now recognized that there is considerable gray matter involvement in MS as well as diffuse white matter pathology that contributes to long-standing disability . Lesion distribution . The number, size and distribution of lesions vary widely amongst individuals with MS . In early disease most patients have small circumscribed lesions that typically occur in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, corpus callosum, optic nerves, cerebellum and spinal cord (Figure 2.1) . Nowadays, more diffuse white matter pathology and early gray matter lesions are being seen using new MRI techniques, as well as in pathological studies . The whole brain volume loss seen early in the course of MS is likely to be associated with these diffuse as well as discrete changes of MS that lead to brain atrophy . Although disease may be macroscopically confined to the white matter, careful neuropathological evaluation reveals focal cortical and deep gray matter lesions in almost all patients with MS (Figure 2.2) . Rarely, patients present with massive ('tumefactive') hemispheric lesions that are mistaken for primary brain neoplasms until typical pathological changes of MS are identified on biopsy tissue . Many MS lesions are associated with cerebral vessels, and some contain a small central vein . MRI machines with stronger magnets can now confirm over 80% of perivenular MS lesions; high-field MRI may help to end the debate as to whether a central vein is needed to confirm a MS lesion . Chronic lesions . Well-circumscribed, chronic, hypocellular, white matter plaques predominate in most patients with longstanding MS . The majority of these lesions are devoid of myelin and exhibit relative axonal preservation (Figure 2.3) . A proportion of chronic lesions may have a fringe of thin myelin sheaths at the plaque border, representing remyelination . Acute lesions: implications for pathogenesis . Active lesions, which predominate in early relapsing MS, are defined pathologically by the presence of partially myelinated axons in tissue infiltrated by macrophages . When stained with Luxol fast-blue (a stain for myelin), these macrophages are found to contain myelin particles that are immunoreactive for myelin proteins (Figure 2.4) . In the most widely accepted paradigm, phagocytic activity is directed by myelin-specific T cells in perivascular cuffs and, in lesser numbers, diffusely infiltrating the parenchyma within such lesions . This hypothesis has been challenged by the neuropathological interrogation of ultra-acute (newly forming) MS lesions, which are characterized by extensive loss of oligodendrocytes without significant T-cell infiltrates . Whatever the cause, myelin loss from axons proceeds rapidly and is usually complete within 2 weeks of symptom onset . Lesions examined during this time show a variable reduction in oligodendrocyte numbers and evidence of at least modest axonal injury . The periplaque white matter . New myelin is laid down by a population of oligodendrocytes that appears within lesions only days after an episode of acute inflammatory demyelination . Although remyelination is the default response to demyelination in early relapsing disease, the process progressively fails with advancing disease and age in many patients . Anti-LINGO1 is now being studied in relapsing forms of MS in a concurrent Phase II study . 'Neurodegeneration' and gray matter lesions . Although myelin appears to be 'targeted' in MS lesions, focal and diffuse axonal loss is present in the white matter of patients with relapsing and progressive forms of the disease (see pages 26 -) . Diffuse white matter axonal loss becomes most prominent in longstanding disease, and is accompanied by diffuse activation of microglia and the presence of scattered perivascular T-cell cuffs . Focal gray matter lesions are less inflammatory than their white matter counterparts, likely a reflection of reduced myelin density in the gray matter rather than any fundamental difference in lesion pathogenesis . Concordant with this finding, neuroimaging studies indicate that brain volume loss preferentially occurs in the gray matter in early relapsing MS . ","Early relapsing MS is a multifocal inflammatory demyelinating and degenerative disease that affects both the white and gray matter. MS leads to a diffuse change in the white matter, which explains the brain atrophy that occurs early in the disease course. Although still considered to be an organ-specific autoimmune disease, loss of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in newly forming MS lesions is a critical event that may trigger or amplify the inflammatory cascade that characterizes active demyelination. Resolution of inflammation, restoration of axonal impulse propagation and remyelination mediate recovery from discrete clinical relapses in early disease. Molecular reorganization of demyelinated axon membranes, characterized by a greater than normal sodium channel density, permits the restoration of continuous impulse propagation in non-remyelinated fibers. As the disease advances, the pathological complexity of MS increases. Multifocal adaptive inflammation is progressively replaced by a diffuse 'degenerative' phase, although these two facets of MS neuropathology are probably inextricably linked. Current therapies effectively target the inflammatory pathology that peaks in early disease but, until recently, have failed to arrest the progression of established 'neurodegeneration' or promote endogenous repair mechanisms such as remyelination; we are on the cusp of a new era in MS therapies, with the first remyelination study showing positive effects."

Patients with acute liver disease typically have no previous history of liver injury . Chronic liver injuries . The primary care provider more often encounters chronic, rather than acute, liver disease . The liver is usually enlarged and may be firm; a tender liver is uncommon . History of jaundice should be determined with respect to liver disease . Medications may also cause liver disease, so it is important to determine which medications a patient is taking, and particularly those temporally related to the development of the liver disorder . Some over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies have also been reported to cause liver abnormalities . A family history of liver disease is equally important . In our experience the liver disease that most commonly clusters in a family is alcoholic liver disease (ALD), but other diseases such as Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis (see Chapter 6) should be considered . Liver function tests . The liver typically responds to injury by releasing enzymes from hepatocytes and/or biliary epithelium . ALT is a cytoplasmic enzyme found primarily in the liver . Both AST and ALT are released from injured hepatocytes, and elevated levels are found in the blood of patients with liver disease of diverse etiologies . In most liver disorders, ALT is higher than AST . Patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase of hepatic origin usually have symptoms or signs of liver disease or other hepatic abnormalities on biochemical screening . Thus, in liver disease, 5NT and GGT will be elevated as well as the alkaline phosphatase, whereas in bone disease 5NT and GGT levels will be normal . Most clotting factors are produced by the liver . Thus, measurement of PT is a reliable marker of liver function . Occasionally, vitamin K deficiency and liver disease coincide . Thus, administering vitamin K to a patient with an elevated PT is reasonable . Thus, measurement of the albumin concentration is a reasonable test of the synthetic capacity of the liver . Similarly, a patient who is malnourished may not deliver enough substrate to the liver for adequate synthesis of albumin . Malnutrition and liver disease frequently coexist . Injury of liver cells (exempli gratia in hepatitis or cirrhosis) is another cause of elevated bilirubin levels . Both acute and chronic liver disease may result in hyperbilirubinemia that is usually predominantly of the conjugated fraction . These patients only require reassurance . Radiology plays an important role in the evaluation of patients with some forms of liver disease . In addition, fatty infiltration of the liver can be diagnosed with reasonable sensitivity and specificity . A liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver disease . A liver biopsy usually allows a definitive diagnosis of the underlying liver disorder and staging of the disease (severity of permanent liver injury; fibrosis; cirrhosis) . Investigational pathways for mildly abnormal liver function tests . Alcoholic liver disease . This particularly applies to women . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is another explanation for this pattern of abnormal liver function tests . increased BMI or obesity . The liver function profile may underestimate the severity of the liver disease in a minority of patients . When the viral screen is negative, investigations should be extended to cover other causes of chronic liver disease . ferritin measurement . An ultrasound scan of the liver and possibly a liver biopsy complete the investigation in most instances . ","Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase suggest injury to hepatocytes. An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase suggests injury to structures of the biliary tree. Prothrombin time (after vitamin K) and serum albumin are used to assess the liver's ability to synthesize proteins. Increases in serum bilirubin occur for many reasons, but generally indicate severe disease. A liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver disease."
9781905832729,ch_2,"However, particular aspects of the anatomy and function of the urinary tract are relevant to understanding bladder disorders and should be familiar to anyone working in the field . The relevant anatomy of the urinary system is shown in Figure 1.1 . The term 'internal sphincter' is often used and refers to the smooth muscle of the bladder neck and proximal urethra . Control of the internal sphincter is involuntary . The term 'external sphincter' or 'external urethral sphincter' refers to the striated muscle that surrounds the proximal urethra and is under voluntary control . Some striated muscle also forms part of the urethra for a variable distance from the bladder neck . The entire striated sphincter complex is often referred to as the 'rhabdosphincter' . Continence is maintained by a complex interaction between the bladder, the urethra, the pelvic floor muscles, the endopelvic fascia and the nervous system . The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system, pressure increasing slowly and steadily as the bladder fills, normally at a rate of 0.5-5 mL/minute . A first need to void is felt when the bladder contains 250-300 mL . Continence is maintained as long as the urethral pressure exceeds the bladder pressure . During normal voiding, voluntary relaxation of the striated musculature in and around the urethra precedes contraction of the detrusor (bladder) muscle . The bladder neck and proximal urethra (often referred to as the 'bladder outlet') become funnel shaped . This relaxation/contraction combination reduces outflow resistance and increases intravesical (in the bladder) pressure, causing the bladder to be emptied forcibly . Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord and the micturition center in the midbrain . The innervation of the bladder is shown in Figure 1.2 . The main neurological pathways that affect bladder contraction are parasympathetic . The sacral reflex center is situated in S2 to S4, and the pelvic nerve and its branches lead from here to the detrusor muscle . Excitation of these nerves stimulates the release primarily of acetylcholine, which acts on muscarinic receptors to cause detrusor contraction . During normal bladder filling, there is no excitatory input from the micturition center in the brain to the sacral micturition center or from the sacral micturition center to the pelvic nerves . The detrusor (bladder) is quiescent . There is a gradual increase in the tone of the external sphincter (striated muscle), mediated through impulses via the pudendal nerve . Voiding depends on coordinated excitation of the sacral parasympathetic nerves and simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary); continence requires the converse (Table 1.1) . Storage and voluntary emptying of the bladder are also influenced by psychological and sociocultural factors . Adults are trained to void in a socially acceptable place and women may not want or like to void in any other place than their homes because of concern about unsafe or unsanitary toilet facilities . Using a toilet away from home can cause psychological stress, suppression of the desire to void and infrequent voiding . Voiding position and posture (exempli gratia squatting or sitting) used by women to empty the bladder differs by cultures or by health status . Negative perceptions of the physical environment of toilets can alter toileting stance or suppress the desire to void . Anatomy and function of the urinary system . ","The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system. Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord, the micturition center in the midbrain and the somatic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Voiding requires a coordinated contraction of the detrusor (bladder smooth musculature), simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary). Continence requires the converse."
9781908541666,ch_2,"According to the US 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet, the prevalence of diabetes in the US population is 8.3%, with estimates ranging from 5.8% in Vermont to 11.3% in Mississippi . Prevalence varies from 7.1% in non-Hispanic whites to 12.6% in non-Hispanic blacks (with even higher rates in Mexican Americans) . This equates to 18.8 million people with diabetes (and 7.0 million with undiagnosed diabetes) . Data from Diabetes UK reveals that 4.45% of the UK population had diabetes in 2011, equating to 2.9 million people . This figure is expected to grow to 5 million people by 2025 . With increasing urbanization in India there has been an explosive increase in the prevalence of diabetes, which has now reached 8.0%, with 50 million people with type 2 diabetes . In China, diabetes has become a major public health problem, with an estimated prevalence of 9.7% . It is clear that, of the 219 countries and territories monitored by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), some nations have substantially higher rates of diabetes . Data from the IDF's 2013 Diabetes Atlas show the highest national prevalence of diabetes in adults in selected Pacific Islands, including Tokelau, Micronesia, the Marshall islands, Kiribati, the Cook islands and Vanuatu, followed by Saudi Arabia (Table 1.1) . Worldwide comparative prevalence of diabetes is shown in Figure 1.1 . According to the IDF, diabetes caused 5.1 million deaths globally in 2013 - approximately 6% of total world mortality . Even more people have died from cardiovascular disease, the risk of which is increased by diabetes-related comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and renal disease . Data for deaths attributable to diabetes according to world regions are shown in Figure 1.2 . Globally, most people with diabetes are in the age range 40-59 years, a time in which productivity at work and contribution to family life is anticipated . Illness, disability and premature death in this age group profoundly affect personal and family life, communities and national productivity . IDF data show that preventable complications of diabetes account for an additional 23 million years of life lost through disability and reduced quality of life . Data extrapolations suggest the prevalence will continue to rise steeply and that by 2035, 592 million people will be affected . The IDF has identified several reasons for the steep increase anticipated in diabetes prevalence: overweight and obesity, unhealthy eating, sedentary lifestyles, urbanization and an aging population . In terms of the population-based burden of diabetes, China has the highest number of people affected, based on 2013 data collected by the IDF, followed by India and the USA (Table 1.2) . Rapid changes in lifestyle associated with westernization have led to large increases in the prevalence of diabetes throughout Asia . Of concern, recent data show no sign that the rate is slowing . People of Asian descent develop diabetes at lower degrees of obesity and at younger ages . There are also data to suggest Asian people suffer longer from diabetes complications and die earlier than people in other regions . An accelerating factor appears to be childhood obesity, which is increasing at alarming rates in Asia . Access to drugs . There are clear disparities between nations in access to drugs . About 80% of people with diabetes live in the world's poorest nations, but 80% of medical expenditure for diabetes occurs in the world's economically richest nations . Inevitably, people with type 1 diabetes who cannot access insulin die . Recent trends in children . Type 1 diabetes develops in about 79 000 children under the age of 14 every year . Recent data indicate the rate of new cases of type 1 diabetes is increasing by 3% every year, promoted by, among other factors, escalating rates of childhood obesity . About 25% of all cases of type 1 diabetes are in South East Asia, with about 20% in Europe . Finland, Sweden and Norway have the highest incidence of type 1 diabetes . Rates of type 1 diabetes also appear to be increasing in eastern European countries . The rate of type 2 diabetes is also increasing in children, though more data are required . ","The prevalence of diabetes is increasing around the world, reflecting the massive societal changes in dietary habits, with energy overconsumption, an increase in sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Different ethnic groups are particularly susceptible to diabetes. The obesity epidemic is impacting on earlier development of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The impact of diabetes and its complications will have the greatest burden on resource-poor nations with limited access to insulin and renal replacement (dialysis and transplantation)."
9781912776696,hh-9,"In fact, the mean age in the control group was 55.6 years compared with 57.8 years in the active treatment group . The raw means in the two groups were 0.21 mmol/L (control) and 0.45 mmol/L (active treatment), with a treatment difference of 0.24 mmol/L . Similarly, the mean fall in total cholesterol in the active treatment group would have been as follows . The active treatment group was penalized by having more older subjects and fewer younger subjects than the control group . When this is corrected, there is a larger treatment effect . This adjusted treatment difference of 0.27 mmol/L is statistically significant, with a two-sided p -value of 0.045 . Adjusting for the imbalances in age across the treatment groups has produced a statistically significant difference . This corresponds to a weighted average of the treatment differences in each stratum . Even minor imbalances can affect the comparability of the treatment groups and bias the estimate of the true treatment effect . The treatment difference (response rate on active treatment minus response rate on placebo) is then calculated in each factor category . The adjusted treatment difference is the average of the treatment differences in the factor categories weighted by the percentages of patients overall in those categories . The p -value comparing the treatment groups is then based on this adjusted difference . Note that the HR is already a measure of treatment difference . The equation of this line is . Evaluating dependence . However, it would not be especially sensitive as those means would not be that different . There are also patients in the control group who are doing well (time to disease progression of over 20 months) . An alternative way of comparing the two treatment groups would be to exploit the dependence of time to disease progression on size of primary tumor . To do this, two equations are fitted to the data, one for the active treatment group and one for the control group . y = a + bx, control group . y = (a + c) + bx, active treatment group . The control group regression line crosses the y -axis at a while the active treatment group regression line crosses the y -axis at a + c . y = 25.18 - 3.77 x, control group . y = (25.18 + 5.94) - 3.77 x, active treatment group . If the active treatment was not effective, the data points for that group would be overlapping with the data points for the control group and the two fitted lines would not be separated . Null hypothesis, H: c = 0, no treatment effect . Alternative hypothesis, H: c ≠ 0, treatment effect . Suppose that size of primary tumor was not well balanced across the control and active treatment groups, with more patients with larger tumors being randomized to the active treatment group and more patients with smaller tumors being randomized to the control group . This imbalance would penalize the active treatment group . Simply comparing the mean time to disease progression for each group would be misleading and could fail to pick up a treatment effect . y = a + b x + b x + b x, control group . y = (a + c) + b x + b x + b x, active treatment group . Below are the equations, with slopes b and b for the control and active treatment groups, respectively . y = a + b x, control group . y = a + b x, active treatment group . y = 25.36 - 3.85 x, control group . y = 21.51 - 3.70 x, active treatment group . If the differences between the slopes had been significant, there would have been a treatment group by covariate (treatment x covariate) interaction, with evidence that the treatment difference depends on the size of the primary tumor . This takes account of the patient-to-patient variability . Statistical modeling . where z = 0 if the patient is in the control group, z = 1 if the patient is in the active treatment group . This model reduces to . mean y = a + bx, control group . mean y = (a + c) + bx, active treatment group . ANCOVA (investigating treatment x covariate interactions) . mean y = a + bx, control group . mean y = (a + c) + (b + d) x, active treatment group . ","A stratified analysis (analysis of variance; ANOVA) gives a treatment effect, adjusting for baseline imbalances for continuous and score endpoints. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test compares treatments, adjusting for baseline imbalances for a binary endpoint, while the stratified logrank test does the same for a time-to-event endpoint. Linear regression (univariate analysis) and multiple regression (multivariate analysis) investigate the dependence of an outcome on baseline factors. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is an extension of ANOVA that can adjust for continuous covariates and for several covariates simultaneously when comparing treatments. ANCOVA can also be used to investigate treatment x covariate interactions. These statistical models can be incorporated into a single modeling framework that models the mean for continuous and score endpoints. Patient-to-patient variation is assumed to follow a normal distribution. The logistic model provides a corresponding framework for binary endpoints that models the odds for the event. The Cox model provides a corresponding framework for time-to-event endpoints that models the hazard rate."
9781908541420,ch_3,"Disease mechanisms . A characteristic finding in asthma, reported only recently, is the presence of mast cells distributed within airway smooth muscle . As asthma becomes more severe, the number of MC TC increases in the mucosa at the expense of MC T . Characteristically in asthma, PEF differs by more than 20% between morning and evening measurements . Definition of asthma based on pathophysiology . Historically asthma has been defined as a disease characterized by the presence of eosinophils in mucosal inflammation . Such stratification of asthma, particularly in those with more severe disease, has implications for targeting therapy to those most responsive . Risk factors for asthma . Asthma is a complex condition, and its causes are not fully understood . host factors that predispose an individual to asthma . causal factors, which are environmental factors that influence susceptibility to the development of asthma in predisposed individuals . Predisposing factors . The prevalence of asthma increases with increasing serum IgE concentration . Up to 80% of children and young adults with asthma are atopic with aeroallergen hypersensitivity dominating . Atopic diseases, including asthma, have strong heritability, accounting for up to 50% of clinical expression . Childhood asthma is more common in boys than in girls until the age of about 10 years, when the difference disappears . Severe persistent asthma in adults is more frequent in women . Clearly, genetic influences can modify the risk of an individual developing atopy and asthma . While no single gene has been identified as being causative for asthma, several genetic loci have been associated with increased asthma risk, particularly in certain environments resulting in a gene-environment interaction . It is likely that several of these may work synergistically to cause asthma in individuals exposed to appropriate environmental factors . This suggests that factors such as degree of exposure to microbial products or alterations in gastrointestinal flora may be protective for the development of asthma and atopy . Dietary factors have been associated with asthma and allergic disease . The relevance of different causes of asthma depends on individual exposure and when it occurs . In early childhood, inhaled allergens and infection appear to be important causal factors for asthma . There is a strong correlation between the prevalence of asthma and long-term exposure to allergen, and asthma often improves when the allergen is removed, although this is not always feasible . The most important fungi to have been associated with asthma are Aspergillus and Alternaria . Chronic colonization of the airways with Aspergillus can be associated with severe asthma, particularly in those who are also allergic to this mold . Individuals with NSAID-hypersensitive asthma commonly have nasal polyposis and typically have florid eosinophilic asthma despite often being non-atopic . Exposure to acetaminophen (paracetamol) early in life has also been linked to asthma . Exposure to cigarette smoke is one of the potentially modifiable causes of asthma . Passive exposure is an important early-life risk factor for asthma, impairing lung growth and encouraging allergic responses in early infancy . In adults, there is some evidence that smoking may increase the risk of developing asthma after exposure to some occupational sensitizers . Laboratory studies have identified a number of air pollutants as factors in worsening asthma, but epidemiological studies of the relationship between outdoor air pollution and asthma have yielded conflicting results . Exposure to air pollution, especially that associated with summer episodes (exempli gratia ozone), is a well-established cause of exacerbations of established asthma . The relationship between asthma and dietary factors is unclear . There is some evidence that asthma is associated with food allergy during infancy, which often precedes other atopic disorders such as allergic rhinitis and, frequently, asthma . Therefore, dietary modifications during pregnancy and infancy to prevent asthma are not currently recommended as isolated interventions . The role of particular infections, such as rhinoviruses, as a cause of asthma in early life, is becoming increasingly well established, particularly in association with allergen exposure . This has been named the 'two hit hypothesis' for the origins of asthma . Obesity is considered a major risk factor for asthma . In addition, some of the comorbidities of obesity, such as reduced ventilatory capacity, gastroesophageal reflux and sleep-disordered breathing, may trigger asthma or asthma-like symptoms . ","Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the conducting airways. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of airflow limitation which, depending on the severity of the attack, can cause breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness, cough and, rarely, death Structural changes also occur in the airways; these are particularly evident in those with severe and chronic asthma. The structural abnormalities in asthma include thickened basement membrane, mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and mast cells within the airway smooth muscle. Airway inflammation in people with asthma is not uniform: in most it is eosinophil predominant, but in others neutrophil cell types predominate. The most prominent risk factors are allergen exposure in genetically susceptible individuals and maternal cigarette smoking. Genetic factors determine susceptibility to environmental factors, and it is the interaction between these that leads to clinical disease."
9783318066241,ch4,"Theoretically, patients in which an early prediction of severity can be made can then be monitored more carefully, allowing early detection and treatment of organ dysfunction . Predictors of severity can also identify patients who may benefit from contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) to detect local complications . Many clinical trials testing new drugs for AP only recruit patients with predicted severe disease . While attempts to predict the severity of AP should be made early in the course of disease, ultimately severity should be classified at discharge as mild, moderate or severe according to the presence or absence of local and systemic complications during the course of disease . Classification of severity is discussed in Chapter 5 . Basal characteristics associated with worse outcomes . Comorbidity and obesity are important factors associated with an increased risk of persistent organ failure (OF) and mortality . Only extreme age seems independently associated with increased mortality . Early signs and laboratory and imaging predictors of severity . Although initial symptoms are of no use for predicting severity, the following signs on early physical examination are associated with a higher probability of adverse outcomes . Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) detected in the emergency room and/or a subsequent increase in BUN in the first 24 hours is associated with an increased risk of persistent OF and mortality . An increased hematocrit (>= 44%) on admission is associated with persistent OF and pancreatic necrosis . Local complications are associated with worse outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality (due to their association with SIRS and persistent OF) . CECT is the most commonly used imaging technique to detect local complications . However, CECT is associated with radiation exposure, so its use is inappropriate in patients with an obvious diagnosis of AP and predicted mild disease . CECT should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis and those who have predicted severe disease, persistent SIRS, the presence of signs or symptoms suggesting local complications (inability to resume oral feeding, persistent pain, palpable mass, fever, etc . or who develop acute abdomen . Two historically important scoring systems - the Balthazar score and the CT score (Table 4.1) - have been developed for assessing the severity of local complications in AP on the basis of findings on CT imaging . Most patients with local complications develop SIRS, and only patients with systemic inflammation are at risk of OF . It has been extensively reported that having SIRS (>= SIRS criteria; Figure 4.1) is associated with a worse prognosis, and persistent (>= 48 hours) SIRS is particularly associated with increased morbidity and mortality . Approximately 30% of patients have SIRS criteria at admission; almost half of them will develop transient or persistent OF . Persistent OF is a marker of severe disease and is associated with maximum morbidity and a high risk of mortality (52% according to a large prospective cohort study), whereas transient OF is associated with increased morbidity but a low rate of mortality (7%) . Scoring systems for predicting severity . Many scoring systems for predicting the severity of AP have been developed over the past five decades . The ideal scoring system should make an early (at admission or within the first 24 hours) prediction of severity and should be accurate . Ranson and Imrie scores, developed in the 1970s, are calculated at admission and 48 hours later; this delay makes these scores less useful . The APACHE-II score has been extensively validated in AP . The BISAP score was developed as a simple scoring system to be used at admission and consists of five dichotomous variables . The presence of three or more of these variables predicts severe disease . Many scoring systems have low external validity because they were developed in referral centers with higher proportions of moderate-to-severe cases of AP . This gives a falsely high positive predictive value of the different methods for predicting severity compared with non-referral populations . In general, the predictors of severity have a high negative predictive value (as most patients will develop only mild disease) but a low-to-moderate positive predictive value . The personal experience of the authors suggests that SIRS, and especially persistent SIRS, is particularly useful in predicting severity . Recent guidelines on the initial medical treatment of AP from the American Gastroenterological Association point out that there are no studies investigating the clinical impact of using severity prediction tools in AP . ","Comorbidity and obesity are baseline characteristics associated with worse outcomes. Early increases in serum blood urea nitrogen or hematocrit are associated with worse outcomes. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, particularly when persistent (>= 48 hours), is associated with an increased frequency of local and systemic complications. In general, scoring systems for predicting severity have a high negative predictive value and a low-to-moderate positive predictive value."
9781908541727,ch05,"Red eye, blurred vision and double vision are all common and important eye symptoms . However, you should also listen carefully to the patient for the presence of other symptoms that may indicate serious eye disease . Important symptoms . A combination of new-onset flashing lights and and new-onset floaters signals a higher likelihood of a retinal tear or detachment . Flashing lights . Patients with migraine often see flashing or sparkling lights before the onset of their headache; sometimes they experience these symptoms without their usual headache (acephalgic migraine) . Flashing lights that are not the prodrome of migraine are most commonly due to an age change in the vitreous called posterior vitreous detachment, in which the vitreous jelly pulls away from the retina . The resultant minor retinal traction causes retinal neurons to fire, and the patient then sees flashing lights . However, in a minority of patients the flashing lights are caused by significant retinal traction resulting in a retinal tear or detachment, which requires urgent laser or surgical treatment . Most of us, when looking at a blue sky or a white wall, can see small clear or gray floaters in our vision; these are normal imperfections in the vitreous jelly . Visual field loss . Table 5.1 outlines the different types of visual field defect in terms of how they are perceived by the patient, the anatomic site at which they occur and the causes of each type of defect . Persisting visual field loss is always due to serious eye, optic nerve or brain disease . Some patients will spontaneously mention that their vision is bad only in a certain area (exempli gratia only out to the side) in one or both eyes . Others will realize (if you ask them) that their blurred vision is only in part of the visual field (Figure 5.1), and some patients may be asymptomatic and the field defect only noted on examination . Causes include retinal disease, optic nerve disease, a pituitary tumor compressing the intracranial optic nerve/s or chiasm, and retrochiasmal stroke or brain tumor . Transient visual field loss . Transient binocular homonymous field loss may occur as part of the migraine prodrome . This is usually a slowly expanding visual field defect surrounded by flashing lights or zig-zag lines (a scintillating scotoma) (Figure 5.2) . Transient homonymous visual field loss (usually without flashing lights) may also occur in vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) . Transient visual field loss in one eye is likely to be amaurosis fugax . Visual distortion (metamorphopsia) is almost always a symptom of macular (central retinal) disease (Figure 5.3) . If onset is sudden in elderly patients, it may be a warning sign of 'wet' age-related macular degeneration (AMD) . There are also many other macular diseases . Photophobia (sensitivity to light) can be the earliest symptom of iritis, before the eye becomes red or the vision becomes blurred . It is also important to check for non-ocular causes of photophobia (exempli gratia meningitis) . Eye pain or eye ache can occur in early acute glaucoma, scleritis or iritis, before the eye becomes red . Pain may also be referred to the eye from intracranial structures (exempli gratia those compressed by a brain tumor); common headaches or trigeminal neuralgia can also result in eye pain . Temporal arteritis (giant cell arteritis) is a treatable but acutely sight- and life-threatening disease that only affects patients over the age of 50 . It is therefore important to ask any patient over 50 who has headaches or visual symptoms specifically whether they have any of the symptoms of temporal arteritis described in Table 5.2 . The only clinical sign of temporal arteritis (other than signs of its complications) is tenderness and/or non-pulsatility of the temporal arteries on palpation; however, this is often unreliable . Even if no visual symptoms are present initially, patients with untreated temporal arteritis can suddenly go permanently blind in one or both eyes, usually from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . If, however, the disease is suspected early, and the patient is referred urgently and is treated with high-dose steroids, visual loss and life-threatening complications can usually be prevented . ",Any of the following symptoms require urgent ophthalmic referral:- flashing lights (other than the visual prodrome of migraine)- new-onset floating spots- visual field loss- visual distortion- photophobia (sensitivity to light)- pain in the eye (even if vision is normal and the eye is not red)- symptoms of temporal arteritis (if the patient is over 50). A combination of flashing lights and floating spots may indicate a retinal tear or detachment. Visual distortion is almost always a symptom of serious macular disease. Photophobia or eye pain may indicate early iritis or acute glaucoma. Urgent referral of patients with symptoms of temporal arteritis could save their sight or their life. - flashing lights (other than the visual prodrome of migraine) - new-onset floating spots - visual field loss - visual distortion - photophobia (sensitivity to light) - pain in the eye (even if vision is normal and the eye is not red) - symptoms of temporal arteritis (if the patient is over 50).
9781910797693,chp5,"Variable uptake of biosimilars: the European experience . Biosimilars have been available in Europe for more than a decade, since the first biosimilar (human growth hormone, Omnitrope ®) was approved in 2006; more than 30 biosimilars had been approved at the start of September 2017, listed in Table 5.2 . Patient exposure to European-approved biosimilars over this period has been more than 700 million patient-days, with no signal that these less-costly biosimilars have any meaningful difference in safety or efficacy from their originator biologics . By contrast, only six biosimilars are currently approved in the USA (Table 5.3) . While a biosimilar may have regulatory approval there may be a delay before sales can begin due to patent expiry dates . Despite positive reasons to embrace biosimilars, sales data show significant variation in uptake: for filgrastim, uptake varied between 1% of the potential use in Belgium to 94% in the UK . Figure 5.1 illustrates the broad variation in the uptake of different classes of biosimilars across Europe . Gaining the confidence of clinicians to start new patients on biosimilars, and to switch patients during treatment, is crucial to creating a competitive market . However, studies show that there is some way to go in building this confidence with biosimilars . A survey of Belgian clinicians, pharmacists, payers, and industry experts found that the barriers to biosimilar use fell into three categories . lack of confidence towards biosimilars by some stakeholders . uncertainty about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars . In 2016, a survey of specialist clinicians in the USA found that 45% believed that biosimilars would be safe for use in new and existing patients; this proportion ranged from 34% to 57% depending on specialty (Table 5.4) . The survey identified five major gaps in clinicians' understanding that had the potential to slow biosimilar uptake . defining biologics, biosimilars, and biosimilarity . understanding the approval process and the use of 'totality of evidence' to evaluate biosimilars . understanding that the safety and immunogenicity of a biosimilar are comparable to those of the originator biologic . understanding the rationale for extrapolation of indications . If, however, clinicians are unwilling to switch patients to biosimilars, pharmacies are forced to stock multiple brands of the same drug and therefore forgo much of the potential economic gain . This rationale applies to most classes of biosimilar, as shown in Table 5.5 . Switching is discussed in more detail on page 62 . Recognition that switching from biologics to biosimilars, whilst potentially problematic, is crucial to the economic benefit of biosimilars, prompted an unprecedented intervention in 2017 by some of Europe's national drug regulators . This was based on three factors: the high analytic similarity of biosimilars to originator drugs; no evidence of a difference in drug immunogenicity; and the wealth of clinical trial data available from over a decade of biosimilar use . Even though biosimilars have relatively high prices compared with small molecule drugs, their introduction has served to improve patient access through the resultant cost savings that can be realized . Despite this dramatic increase in drug volume, however, cost savings were realized through the prevention of neutropenia and the high associated cost of treatment . When biosimilar filgrastim was introduced in New Zealand in 2012, national audits confirmed both increased patient access and improved outcomes for the overall patient population . As a result, the proportion of women receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for breast cancer who experienced neutropenic fever decreased from one-third prior to biosimilars to fewer than 7% with biosimilars . These examples illustrate that the introduction of biosimilars can increase patient access, allowing more patients to be treated from the same budget . Competitive pricing of biosimilars compared with the reference products also improves patient access . A 2017 report for the EU reported that list prices for key drug classes in 2016 were 7-37% lower than in the year before approval of the biosimilar (Table 5.6) . Biosimilars have also reversed negative decisions in heath technology assessments . However, in a subsequent appraisal in 2014 (TA323), prices were taken from the tender bids placed for contracts to supply epoetins to the London Medicines Procurement Programme; as a result of the competition created by biosimilars, NICE approved use of these drugs in the NHS . ","Four generations of biosimilar have been developed, from the simple hormone replacement molecules to complex monoclonal antibodies used for chronic inflammatory disorders and cancer, and more than 30 are now approved in the EU, but only six in the USA. There has been no indication that the biosimilars have any meaningful difference in safety or efficacy from their originator biologics, based on more than 700 million patient-days' exposure to European-approved biosimilars over the last 10 years. Uptake of biosimilars has varied by therapy area and geography, ranging from 1% to 90%; some surveys report persistent concerns among clinicians about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars. The introduction of the biosimilar filgrastim led to a dramatic increase in use whilst realizing cost savings because fewer patients required treatment for neutropenia; it also drove down the price of a long-acting version of filgrastim that was still patent protected. Managed programs in which savings from switching could be reinvested in staffing have realized substantial savings. Competitive pricing has also reversed health technology assessments for erythropoietins by improving the cost-effectiveness of treatment."
9781908541666,ch_6,"Monogenic forms of diabetes mellitus . Monogenic forms of diabetes account for 1-2% of diabetes . These forms of diabetes result from mutations affecting the genes that regulate beta cell function . They are commonly referred to as maturity onset diabetes of youth (MODY), though the more correct name is monogenic diabetes . It is important to consider these forms of diabetes, as their treatment requirements can differ and they can be misclassified as type 1 or 2 diabetes . The family history is usually positive for diabetes in two to three generations, which should raise the suspicion . Monogenic diabetes can be distinguished into types detected at birth and types detected later in life . About 10-15% of children diagnosed with diabetes are negative for autoantibodies . Monogenic diabetes should be considered as a cause in these children if there is a family history of diabetes . The commonest forms of monogenic diabetes are listed in Table 5.2 . Neonatal hyperglycemia . Individuals diagnosed before the age of 6 months are more likely to have monogenic diabetes than autoimmune beta cell destruction (type 1 diabetes) . This form of monogenic diabetes is best treated with oral sulfonylurea medication rather than insulin . Thus, making an accurate diagnosis in these circumstances affects clinical treatment . The majority of these cases occur as spontaneous mutations, and there is usually no family history . Mutations in the glucokinase gene results in familial mild fasting hyperglycemia (MODY2) . This condition can be present from birth and asymptomatic and it does not require any specific treatment . Treatment is generally not required . Hepatic nuclear factor mutations . There is often a strong family history of diabetes and the onset of hyperglycemia before the age of 25 years . Genetic analysis for diagnosis is useful for these patients as the diagnosis can alter clinical management . HNF1A mutations (or MODY3) produce diabetes in adolescence or early adulthood . Glycosuria is present early on, even before the development of hyperglycemia . With progressive beta cell failure, fasting hyperglycemia develops . Microvascular complications in this form of monogenic diabetes are predicted by glycemic control, just as for type 1 and type 2 diabetes . Interestingly, patients with this mutation appear to be more susceptible to ischemic heart disease, despite having the elevated HDL cholesterol that characterizes the condition . HNF1B (or MODY5) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes due to transcription factor mutation . Estimates suggest it accounts for 1% of all diabetes . HNF4A (or MODY1) mutations produce diabetes that appears very similar to that arising from mutations in HNF1A, with the distinction of a different lipid pattern . Again, diagnosis assists in clinical management as this form of diabetes responds to low-dose sulfonylurea therapy . Diabetes mellitus associated with other endocrine diseases . Diabetes can also occur in the context of other underlying endocrine diseases, such as Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis and pheochromocytoma . Clinical features of these conditions should be sought at diagnosis of diabetes, with biochemical confirmation . Treatment of the underlying condition usually results in amelioration of the hyperglycemia . Pancreatic disease . Conditions affecting the integrity of the pancreas can damage beta cells and result in hyperglycemia . Drug-induced diabetes mellitus . Hyperglycemia can result from a number of drugs that affect either insulin secretion or insulin action . Glucocorticoids reduce insulin action, even at low doses . Glucocorticoids can unmask an underlying susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, but can also induce hyperglycemia if used at high enough doses . Anti-HIV drugs also increase insulin resistance . HIV infection treated with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, with some studies indicating a fourfold increase . Pentamidine, a drug used to treat pneumocystis infection in AIDS, is a beta cell toxin that has also been associated with inducing ketosis-prone diabetes that requires ongoing insulin therapy . Transplantation-associated diabetes mellitus . Recipients of renal and cardiac transplantation appear particularly susceptible . ","Onset of hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis in non-obese individuals under 25 years of age is suggestive of monogenic diabetes (more commonly referred to as maturity onset diabetes of youth - MODY). A positive family history of diabetes in two to three generations should raise this suspicion. Conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis and pancreatic carcinoma can cause hyperglycemia. Glucocorticoids can unmask a susceptibility to type 2 diabetes or cause hyperglycemia at high doses. Anti-HIV drugs increase insulin resistance. Pentamidine can cause ketosis-prone diabetes. Renal, cardiac and lung transplantation increases the risk of diabetes."
9781908541901,ch_5,"The preferred approach to revascularization - percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) - depends on the extent and severity of the lesions as identified by coronary angiography, potential infarct complications, the patient's condition and comorbidities . Percutaneous coronary intervention . The majority of PCIs are performed with the implantation of a stent(s) (Figure 3.1) . The procedure . During PCI, access into the femoral artery in the leg (or the radial artery or brachial artery in the arm) is created by a device called an 'introducer needle' . Once access is gained, a sheath is placed in the opening to keep the artery open and control bleeding . A long, flexible, soft plastic tube called a guiding catheter is advanced through the sheath over a guidewire . The tip of the guiding catheter is placed at the origin of the coronary artery . The guiding catheter also allows for iodine-based radiopaque dyes to be injected into the coronary artery, so that lesion location and severity can be precisely assessed using real-time radiographic visualization . This enables the cardiologist to estimate the size of the coronary artery and select the type of balloon catheter and coronary guidewire to use . A coronary guidewire, which is an extremely thin wire with a radiopaque flexible tip, is then inserted through the guiding catheter and into the coronary artery . Still using real-time radiographic visualization, the wire is guided through the coronary artery to the site of the stenosis or blockage . The tip of the wire is then passed across the blockage . The cardiologist controls the movement and direction of the guidewire by gently twisting the end that sits outside the patient . While the guidewire is in place it acts as the pathway to and across the stenosis . An angioplasty balloon catheter, which is composed of a hollow tube, is inserted over the guidewire and is gently advanced forward until the deflated balloon is positioned across the blockage . Type of stent . Several randomized clinical trials, which included patients with STEMI, have shown that drug-eluting stents reduce the risk of re-intervention compared with bare-metal stents, without having a significant impact on the risk of stent thrombosis, recurrent MI or death . The femoral approach has been widely adopted for PCI in the past . However, the radial approach has been increasingly favored in recent years because of potentially important advantages, including lower risk of major vascular complications and major bleeding, reduced length of stay after the procedure, reduced use of resources, and possibly lower mortality in high-risk patients such as those with STEMI . Bleeding at the site of radial access, radial artery injury and occlusion, increased radiation exposure, and the significant learning curve that is required to master the procedure before implementation of the radial approach as the standard method to achieve access in STEMI, are important considerations that need to be addressed when using the radial approach . Coronary artery bypass grafting . Approximately 10% of patients with acute coronary syndromes (STEMI and NSTEMI) undergo CABG during initial hospitalization (Figure 3.2) . The procedure . CABG involves connecting, or grafting, a healthy artery (usually a mammary artery from the chest wall) directly to the coronary artery beyond the narrowing or blockage, or a vein to the coronary artery beyond the narrowing or blockage, and then connecting the vein to the aorta . Another potential artery used as a conduit is the radial artery . Single, double, triple, quadruple and quintuple (rare) bypasses can be made to a number of coronary arteries . For isolated CABG, the patient's heart is usually stopped and surgery is performed using cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross clamping and cardioplegic cardiac arrest (on-pump CABG) . CABG can also be performed on a beating heart using various stabilization devices to provide a motionless surgical field (off-pump CABG) . In general, off-pump CABG is not performed very frequently, unless there is heavy aortic calcification with a high risk of stroke associated with clamping . In contrast, 10-year patency for the internal thoracic artery is 85% . ","The preferred approach to revascularization depends on the extent and severity of the lesions, potential infarct complications and the patient's condition and comorbidities. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with superior restoration of myocardial blood flow, lower rates of reinfarction and mortality and less intracranial bleeding than pharmacological intervention with fibrinolytic therapy. The use of drug-eluting stents is preferred as they reduce the risk of reintervention compared with bare-metal stents. Approximately 10% of patients with acute coronary syndromes undergo coronary artery bypass grafting during initial hospitalization."
9781910797815,chp6,"All patients eventually become symptomatic as the disease progresses, due to bone marrow failure and increasing splenomegaly, which can lead to abdominal symptoms and early satiety . Aims of treatment . Depending on the clinical presentation, the aims of treatment for myelofibrosis are to . reduce anemia . reduce splenomegaly . alleviate systemic symptoms . As with ET and PV, the choice of treatment for patients with myelofibrosis depends on the level of risk . Risk stratification is essential in patients with myelofibrosis because the level of risk has a marked impact on the prognosis . Median survival in patients at the highest level of risk is approximately 2 years, compared with approximately 20 years in low-risk patients (Figure 6.1) . The MIPSS70-Plus also includes cytogenetic data, including the presence of two or more high-risk mutations . Conversely, approximately one-third of patients classified as low or intermediate-1 risk using the DIPSS-Plus are considered to be at high risk according to the MIPSS70-Plus . Splenomegaly resulting from extramedullary hematopoiesis is characteristic of myelofibrosis . However, all patients ultimately require treatment as the spleen continues to enlarge . Constitutional symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis are believed to result from altered cytokine production, and often respond to ruxolitinib or to the treatment of splenomegaly . In general, JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib are considered as first-line treatment for splenomegaly and symptoms in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis, and SCT is an option for high-risk patients with a poor prognosis . The efficacy and safety of the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis has been investigated in two large randomized placebo-controlled trials: COMFORT-I and -II . Other JAK inhibitors . Three other JAK inhibitors have been evaluated in Phase III studies for the treatment of myelofibrosis (see Chapter 7) . fedratinib is a JAK2 inhibitor . Supportive therapy . However, about 80% of patients require an alternative treatment within approximately 1 year . Among the 17 patients with myelofibrosis, 12 (71%) showed partial remission, clinical improvement or stable disease, as assessed using the International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment criteria . An analysis of 75 patients (19 with myelofibrosis) treated in the real-world setting at a single center reported stable disease in 63% and a favorable safety profile: only one patient experienced grade 3 adverse events . Recent data from a French group are also broadly supportive but highlight that responses are mixed, and many patients discontinue IFN . Thus, the potential benefits and risks of splenectomy must be considered carefully and discussed with the patient . Fractionated splenic radiotherapy may be appropriate for patients with symptomatic hepatosplenomegaly that is resistant to JAK inhibitors and in patients who are not good candidates for surgery, and for the treatment of extramedullary hematopoiesis . The NCCN guidelines for the management of myelofibrosis-associated anemia recommend the following . However, anemia ultimately becomes refractory to treatment in the majority of patients, necessitating regular red blood cell transfusion . Corticosteroids such as prednisone produce response rates of 30-40% in patients with anemia due to myelofibrosis, and may be useful after other therapies have failed . Treatment of blast phase myelofibrosis . Responses to chemotherapy can be achieved but are not durable; palliative treatment should therefore be considered . Monitoring treatment . Disease- and patient-related dimensions must be considered when monitoring response to treatment in patients with myelofibrosis . Monitoring JAK2 inhibitor therapy . Even though marked improvements in symptoms and health-related quality of life are seen with ruxolitinib, more than 50% of patients discontinue treatment within 2-3 years because of resistance (usually secondary; few patients having primary resistant disease), disease progression or intolerance . Patients who stop JAK inhibitors have a poor prognosis . ","Myelofibrosis has the most diverse presentation of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and carries the worst prognosis. Approximately 30% of patients are asymptomatic initially but all patients eventually develop symptoms of bone marrow failure and progressive splenomegaly. The aims of treatment include reduction of anemia and splenomegaly and alleviation of constitutional symptoms. Risk stratification is currently based on the International Progression Scoring System (IPSS) or Dynamic IPSS but new systems that incorporate genetic and cytogenetic risk factors, such as the Mutation-Enhanced International Prognostic Score System (MIPSS70) and MIPSS70-Plus are being developed. Anemia can be treated in the short term with androgens, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and immunomodulators, but most patients eventually become transfusion-dependent. Splenomegaly can be managed using cytoreductive agents, splenectomy, radiation therapy or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Approximately 80% of patients treated with hydroxyurea will require additional therapy within about 1 year.- Splenectomy is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity but may be an option for patients with drug-resistant splenomegaly. The JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is indicated as first-line therapy in patients with splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms. Low-dose fractionated radiotherapy is the current standard of care for extramedullary hematopoiesis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is potentially curative but is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity and is therefore reserved for high-risk patients, possibly those who are transfusion dependent or who have an unfavorable karyotype. Treatment response should be monitored by blood counts, assessment of symptoms using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-Symptoms Assessment Form Total Symptom Score, and objective measurement of spleen volume. - Splenectomy is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity but may be an option for patients with drug-resistant splenomegaly."
9781910797662,ch03,"The classic presenting sign or symptom of a bladder tumor is painless gross or microscopic hematuria; it is the sole presenting symptom in 60-80% of patients . Unfortunately, and despite the well-known sinister implications of this finding, many patients who present with hematuria are not evaluated further or referred to a urologist . Up to 20% of patients with bladder cancer will not have hematuria at presentation . Other patterns of presentation also occur (Table 3.1) and are sometimes similarly unrecognized as an indication of serious underlying pathology . Magnetic resonance urography is an alternative for patients who cannot receive intravenous iodinated contrast . Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria . There is good correlation of 1+ or more dipstick hematuria with significant microscopic hematuria . Abnormal dipstick hematuria results should be confirmed by microscopic examination . Irritative symptoms . Irritative symptoms such as dysuria, increased frequency and urgency are often dismissed because they are common, are usually due to urinary tract infection (UTI) and are typically not associated with serious disease . However, if infection is absent or symptoms persist after the UTI has been treated, the possibility of an underlying bladder malignancy must be considered and the patient referred to a urologist . Irritative symptoms are particularly common in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), and suprapubic pain when the bladder is full can also be caused by carcinoma of the bladder . Urinalysis in patients with irritative symptoms due to CIS or invasive cancer will usually reveal the presence of red or white blood cells . Recurrent urinary tract infections . Recurrent UTI is sometimes due to the presence of a bladder tumor . A single UTI in a man, or two or more in a woman, should be investigated; however, the likelihood of a malignant etiology is very low in patients under 50 years of age . Symptoms of local or distant spread . Patients sometimes present with systemic symptoms due to advanced carcinoma of the bladder . Loin pain can be caused by ureteric obstruction due to an invasive bladder tumor (Figure 3.1) . The pain is usually a dull ache in the costophrenic angle, and may or may not coincide with other symptoms such as hematuria . Occasionally, infection occurs in an obstructed system, giving rise to severe symptoms of pyelonephritis . Pleuritic chest pain may also be present . Anorexia, nausea, weight loss and malaise may result from renal failure due to bilateral ureteric obstruction, or from the systemic effects of the tumor itself . Delay in diagnosis . Although it is difficult to prove that delay in diagnosis affects prognosis, screening for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is associated with a shift towards more favorable tumor characteristics of lower stage and grade at diagnosis, and better survival . Delays may occur for a variety of reasons . Presentation by the patient may be delayed because of anxiety about the cause of the symptoms, fear of primary care physicians or hospitals or ignorance of the significance of symptoms . Referral by the primary care physician to a specialist may be delayed because of ignorance of the significance of the symptoms, or limited access to specialist healthcare (waiting times for clinic appointments) . Diagnosis by the specialist may be delayed because of waiting times for investigations, follow-up clinic appointments for results, or cystoscopy . Taken together, these factors mean that the average time from the first symptom to treatment of the bladder tumor varies from a few weeks to more than a year across studies . In an attempt to streamline the diagnosis and treatment of patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer, many hospitals now offer a hematuria clinic at which patients can be seen within a week of referral . This allows a diagnosis to be made and treatment planned expeditiously . Clots that have been in the bladder for some time may impart a rusty color to the urine . Any patient with these symptoms should be referred to a urologist immediately . Urinary tract bleeding is intermittent with spontaneous resolution, so a single episode warrants evaluation . However, patients sometimes ignore a single episode of hematuria and do not seek advice until the bleeding recurs . Menstruating women may also sometimes confuse hematuria with menstrual flow . The resultant delay in diagnosis and treatment may make treatment more difficult and reduce the possibility of cure . ","Painless hematuria is the most common presentation of bladder cancer. A single episode of hematuria should prompt urgent referral to a urologist. Unexplained irritative symptoms may be due to bladder cancer, particularly carcinoma in situ. Recurrent infections may indicate an underlying tumor. Delay in treatment adversely affects prognosis. Hematuria clinics allow rapid diagnosis and reduce time to treatment."
9783318066685,ch2,"Using gene therapy for polygenic traits would require the coincident targeting of more than one gene; the efficiency of this approach is likely to be too low to be therapeutic . Therefore, gene therapy is more applicable to monogenic diseases, where mutations are carried by a single gene; conditions caused by mutations that result in loss of protein expression and those caused by mutations that result in expression of a protein with altered function are amenable to gene therapy . Loss-of-function mutations . It is possible to use gene therapy to compensate for the defective gene in a number of ways . Replacement of a defective copy of a gene . Gene addition, where the coding DNA of the affected gene is delivered to cells or a tissue, theoretically provides a therapy that would be applicable to all patients with a disease, irrespective of the mutation they possess . This may also apply directly to mutations that affect the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of a gene . Gain-of-function mutations . Gain-of-function mutations generally display autosomal dominant inheritance and result in the expression of proteins with altered function that cause disease . Gene therapies can be used to silence these mutations through a variety of mechanisms . RNA interference (RNAi) can lead to the highly specific targeted knockdown of expression of a disease gene . Targeting non-coding RNA . An siRNA targets a single gene, while an miRNA has multiple gene targets . Both bind the mRNA of target genes in a competitive manner . The miRNAs are suitable targets for therapeutic intervention to control gene expression . The delivery of an miRNA mimic to potentiate miRNA function will downregulate the target mRNA and so block the expression of a pathogenic gene . Endonucleases can be used to disrupt a gene carrying a gain-of-function mutation so that expression is inhibited . Complex diseases . As such, they do not lend themselves to gene therapy . Somatic versus germline gene therapy . The type of cells or tissues targeted using gene therapy determines whether therapy is somatic or germline . Somatic gene therapies are those that target any cell within a body except the reproductive cells . Such gene therapies are considered to be safer, as none of the genetic changes will be inherited by any offspring . Ex vivo application . Using hematopoietic stem cells . It is also possible to exploit HSC gene therapy to engineer the cells to increase the therapeutic gene dosage, to specifically target diseased tissues or to become resistant to particular disease-causing pathogens . Hepatocytes, another adult stem cell type, have also been used for autologous ex vivo gene therapies for certain liver diseases . The genetic manipulation of cells in culture may reduce the reconstitution potential of the infused cells . The technology is continually advancing, and highly efficient gene targeting and site-specific gene editing means that somatic gene disruption (for gain-of-function mutations), gene correction rather than gene replacement (for loss-of-function mutations) and targeted, rather than random, integration are now possible . The most advanced cellular gene therapy involves chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells . T-cell receptors recognize specific antigens on the surface of target cells and induce cell-specific killing . This target-cell-specific killing has been exploited to destroy tumor cells . T cells are a heterogeneous cell population that can be derived from HSCs and genetically manipulated ex vivo so that they express CARs and become tumor targeting . A CAR-T cell therapy that recognizes CD19, a B-cell surface antigen widely expressed in B-cell malignancies, is now an approved gene and cell therapy . In vivo gene therapy involves the direct administration of therapeutic agent, usually via a viral vector (see below), to resident cells of the target tissue . To be successful, the cells need to be easily but specifically targeted and the therapy should be efficacious and long lived . Certain tissues are easily targeted using in vivo gene therapy . It is possible to use tissue-specific promoters and/or regulatory elements to drive expression and engineer the tropism displayed by the viral vectors to direct the gene therapy to the disease-affected tissue . Delivery using non-viral vectors . Delivery using viral vectors . Choice of viral vector . The maximal therapeutic efficacy of a gene therapy is achieved through controlled targeted expression, with the avoidance of side effects associated with off-target and non-physiological expression . ","Loss-of-function mutations can potentially be repaired through gene addition, exon skipping to restore the transcript reading frame, gene editing and upregulation of compensatory genes. Gain-of-function mutations can potentially be treated genetically through endonuclease-mediated gene editing, RNA interference using small interfering (si)RNA or short hairpin (sh)RNA, and antisense oligonucleotides targeting translation start codons, polyadenylation signals or out-of-frame exons. Ex vivo and in situ in vivo gene therapies are - particularly for eye disorders - associated with enhanced safety and targeted efficacy relative to direct systemic in vivo therapy. Non-viral vector delivery, despite generally having safer outcomes than viral delivery, is limited by transient transgene expression and the need for re-administration, which may lead to accumulated toxicological issues. Viral vector delivery has the advantage of persistence of transgene expression, though there are associated genotoxic and immunologic risks that limit efficacy and patient applicability. Preclinical research is focused on improving the safety profiles and manufacturing costs of viral vectors."
9781908541666,ch_7,"A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes changes the lives of affected patients for ever . Many face the prospect of injecting themselves with insulin for the rest of their lives with considerable dread . prevent patients from developing diabetic ketoacidosis . Insulin regimens . Animal-derived insulins (both porcine and bovine) are used by a diminishing minority of patients with a long duration of diabetes . Most patients with type 1 diabetes are treated with a variety of human insulin preparations or, increasingly, recombinant insulin analogs . Patients using animal insulins sometimes maintain that using human insulin produced either by enzymatic modification or recombinant-DNA technology is associated with lack of awareness of hypoglycemia . Only a few manufacturers continue to produce insulin derived from animals . No major world insulin producer continues to do so . If patients using animal insulins report hypoglycemia unawareness, the cause of this (other than insulin type) should be explored and appropriate corrective action taken . Table 6.1 lists some common insulin preparations . Insulin is available in vials from which the insulin is drawn up and injected subcutaneously using lightweight sterilized disposable insulin syringes and matched needles (Figure 6.2) . To date, studies have shown that this insulin is associated with a reduced incidence of nocturnal hypoglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients . Insulin pumps . It may be particularly suitable for patients experiencing recurrent troublesome hypoglycemia with multiple-injection regimens . In some healthcare systems, diabetic patients have to satisfy certain criteria before pump therapy will be sanctioned for funding . Some patients decline the choice of treating their diabetes with a pump for a variety of reasons . It is estimated that 10-15% of patients would fulfill the criteria for pump therapy, although without conditions patient choice might drive this figure much higher . In Germany and other European countries, around 20% of patients with type 1 diabetes are estimated to use insulin pumps . Insulin allergy . Such reactions usually respond to switching to a different insulin preparation . Patients need to be advised at the initiation of insulin treatment to rotate injection sites . Several devices are available on the market for those individuals who find the self-injection of insulin difficult . Such devices may be helpful for patients who are unable to inject using needles, but doubt remains about the precision and accuracy of insulin delivery . Islet cell transplantation . In total, 84% of patients underwent islet cell transplantation alone while 16% underwent transplantation after kidney transplantation . Repeat islet infusions were necessary in the majority of patients . Insulin independence was achieved in 70% of patients at 1 year and in 36% after 4 years . Self-monitoring of blood glucose . Patient self-monitoring of blood glucose is necessary to measure the effect of the administered doses of insulin on blood glucose levels . Not surprisingly, this inhibits some patients from performing the requisite number of blood tests to manage their diabetic condition effectively . They can also suggest insulin 'correction' doses when the blood glucose level is outside the target range . Universal agreement as to how many blood glucose tests a person with insulin-treated diabetes should do to achieve good control is lacking . Patients using less frequent injections could test less often, as suggested above . Intercurrent illness, changes in insulin dose, a change in insulin regimen, preconception and pregnancy necessitate more frequent and intensive blood testing . Occasionally, in some patients, blood testing can become excessive, obsessive and hence counterproductive . Pregnant patients are often advised to check 1 hour after meals in some national guidelines . Patients may also test at other times if they suspect they have symptoms of hypoglycemia . What patients with insulin-treated diabetes would like, however, is the ability to know their blood glucose concentration on a minute-by-minute basis . Similarly, spurious results may be obtained in patients with a hemoglobinopathy . HbA 1c should be measured every 4-6 months in patients with type 1 diabetes to make judgments about glycemic control and the need for modification of the insulin regimen . The American Diabetes Association recommends that patients try to achieve an HbA 1c below 53 mmol/mol (7%) . In good clinical practice the patient and their physician should agree on a specified target HbA 1c based on a shared knowledge of the patient's circumstances . ",Insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes attempts to keep plasma glucose levels as near normal as possible without causing hypoglycemia. Most young patients are treated with a basal-bolus regimen incorporating rapid-acting insulin analogs at mealtimes and a basal long-acting insulin analog. Twice-daily fixed-mixture regimens may be useful for children and the elderly. Pump therapy is a very effective and safe mode of treatment for some patients. Pancreatic and islet cell transplantation may be offered to highly selected type 1 patients. Insulin therapy confers the need to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. Diabetes control is assessed by regular measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ). Diabetes education programs help diabetic patients to manage their condition more effectively.
9781910797471,ch07,"First-line therapy . Diuretics (in patients with fluid retention/pulmonary congestion) are the oldest agents used in HF therapy . The drug is used infrequently, mainly in patients with metabolic alkalosis . All patients with systolic LV dysfunction, including asymptomatic patients (NYHA class I), should be treated with ACE inhibitors at target doses (Table 7.2) . The SOLVD-T trial randomized 2569 patients already receiving conventional treatment for HF to enalapril, 2.5-20 mg daily, or placebo . There were significant reductions in mortality in the enalapril group (the largest reduction was in those with progressive HF) and fewer patients were hospitalized for worsening HF in this group . In total, 3000 patients with NYHA class II-IV were followed up for 4.5 years . Other trials . The valsartan group demonstrated a significantly reduced combined HF mortality and morbidity of 13.2%, and reduced hospitalization for HF by 27.5% . The CHARM trial randomized 4576 patients to candesartan or placebo in two complementary parallel trials: CHARM-Alternative with patients who could not tolerate ACE inhibitors and CHARM-Added with patients who were already receiving ACE inhibitors . In both groups, candesartan significantly reduced all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and HF hospitalizations . Patients had HF and/or LV dysfunction after acute MI . Beta-blockers . The MERIT-HF trial enrolled 3991 patients with NYHA class II-IV stabilized on standard therapy, of whom 1990 patients were randomized to metoprolol succinate (extended release) and 2001 patients were assigned to placebo . The CAPRICORN trial enrolled 1959 patients who had had an acute MI with LV dysfunction . These patients were treated with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) . The COPERNICUS trial randomized 2289 patients with severe (NYHA class IV) HF to carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) or placebo . A total of 2128 patients were randomized to nebivolol (target dose 10 mg) or placebo . As expected, patients with diabetes had higher all-cause mortality than patients without diabetes . However, long-term beta-blocker therapy after MI has been shown to improve survival in patients with and without COPD . HF is predominantly a disease of the elderly, with 50% of HF in patients aged over 75 years . Overall, the survival benefit from beta-blockers in elderly patients with HF (including nebivolol) is modest and a proportion of elderly patients will experience adverse effects . Titration of beta-blocker doses should be guided by the patient's symptoms, with recognition that elderly patients are less likely to achieve maximum doses and more likely to experience adverse effects . Second-line therapy . The study enrolled 8442 patients with HF and . The study excluded patients with . Patients on active treatment were found to have less cardiac remodeling and improved LVEF . However, only 25% of patients reached the target beta-blocker dose . Iron replacement in iron-deficient patients . Polyunsaturated fatty acids should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic despite standard therapy . Digoxin may be considered for symptom relief and to reduce the need for hospitalization in patients who are already on first-line therapy . It also remains a valuable therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) . Beware of drug toxicity, mainly in patients with renal dysfunction . Other therapies . In patients with HF, myocardial CoQ10 content appears to be low . The randomized placebo-controlled Q-SYMBIO trial assessed the effects of supplemental CoQ10 in patients with HF . It can also be considered for patients with severe systolic LV dysfunction . Unless contraindicated, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis should be administered to patients with severe HF who are slow to mobilize . Some HF centers use intravenous inotropic agents in ambulatory patients with severe intractable HF ('pulsed therapy') . Treatment of acute heart failure . Patients with known LV dysfunction who present with acute HF will already be receiving HF medication . Aldosterone antagonists should be stopped in patients with progressive renal dysfunction, and ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy reviewed . Otherwise, beta-blocker therapy should continue . ","Medical management of heart failure (HF) with preserved systolic function remains challenging, but in principle should target the underlying cause (exempli gratia blood pressure, coronary ischemia). Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists are the mainstay of therapy for symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The new angiotensive receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan and the selective sodium-potassium channel inhibitor ivabradine should be considered in patients who remain symptomatic despite therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB and beta-blocker. Inotropic agents are used short term in acute cases with severe cardiac dysfunction (cardiogenic shock) and can be supplemented by mechanical circulatory support (exempli gratia intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device). Acute HF is a medical emergency and the treatment has to be tailored to the underlying clinical problem (lowering blood pressure in severe hypertension, revascularization in acute myocardial infarction)."
9781908541420,ch_10,"Up to 80% of people with asthma will develop exercise-induced symptoms, so that exercise for some people is a real trigger for their asthma . Indeed, in some people asthma is only evident on exercising; this is particularly the case for children, in whom the benefits of exercise are especially important . Consequently, managing exercise-induced asthma and enabling individuals to exercise despite asthma is an important part of asthma management . Optimizing asthma diagnosis and treatment in elite athletes is critical to optimizing performance and deserves particular attention . Exercise-induced asthma is defined as a transient increase in airway resistance that follows vigorous exercise . Many people complain of shortness of breath while exercising, and this symptom is often magnified in people with asthma . A history of developing wheeze, shortness of breath and sometimes cough both during and after exercise should prompt a clinician to consider a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma . Exercise-induced asthma is particularly common in children and approximately 80% of children with asthma will have evidence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction . For some individuals with brittle asthma, the response to exercise can be severe and may be a strong disincentive to exercise . Exercise-induced asthma appears to be more common in those with allergies to inhaled substances and often occurs on exercise in very cold weather . A feature of exercise-induced asthma is a refractory period, whereby induction of exercise-induced asthma appears to be protective for further episodes for a period of several hours . Thus, individuals who experience a bout of exercise-induced asthma can undertake subsequent exercise with relative protection from further episodes . Some people with asthma use this strategy to manage exercise-induced symptoms by undertaking a warm-up to exercise of short, high-intensity exercise bursts . For most, exercise-induced asthma can be diagnosed on symptoms or wheeze or excess dyspnea during or following exercise, which may be confirmed with peak flow testing . In addition, breathing humidified warmed air during exercise has been shown to be protective for the development of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction . By contrast, many individuals with asthma find cold air a potent trigger of symptoms . Airway challenge for the diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma . The problem with laboratory exercise tests is that they may not replicate the environmental conditions under which exercise is performed . As a consequence of these difficulties, surrogate challenges for exercise-induced asthma have been developed so that a diagnosis can be consistently achieved . Exercise challenge testing is an indirect challenge relying on airway responses to exercise, such as airway drying and cooling, to cause smooth muscle contraction . These agents mimic the dehydration of the airways that is probably responsible for exercise-induced asthma . Direct challenges . It is therefore important not to exclude exercise-induced asthma on the basis of a negative direct airway challenge test result . Exercise-induced asthma in athletes . Some elite cold-weather athletes, such as cross-country skiers, are very likely to develop exercise-induced asthma (so called 'skier's asthma') . In summer athletes, a high occurrence of asthma has been reported in elite swimmers . The finding that older athletes and those from sports that are predominantly aerobic are more likely to have exercise-induced asthma supports this theory . Investigation of symptoms of elite athletes revealed that traditional asthma symptoms have a sensitivity of only 60% in predicting exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in laboratory challenge . Thus, poor performance in an athlete ought to prompt consideration of exercise-induced asthma . The diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma in elite athletes must be verified by airway challenges . Treatment for exercise-induced asthma in those with pre-existing asthma is determined by evaluating lung function and symptoms . Individuals with lung function abnormalities and symptoms of asthma both with and without exercise should have the usual controller (preventer) medication prescribed . However, many people with asthma do have asthma symptoms despite regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and may require additional short-acting beta -agonists (SABAs) before exercise to prevent exercise-induced asthma . Some individuals with normal interval lung function complain of symptoms only on exercise . Non-drug strategies for the treatment of exercise-induced asthma rely on the refractory period that follows induction of airway narrowing with exercise . It is frequently recommended that athletes with exercise-induced asthma warm up slowly . They may institute strategies such as repeated high-intensity runs during a warm-up to prevent exercise-induced asthma occurring in the main competition . ","Exercise-induced asthma is defined as a transient increase in airway resistance that follows vigorous exercise. It appears to be more common in those with atopy and to be seen more often on exercise in very cold weather. Induction of exercise-induced asthma appears to be protective for further episodes for a period of several hours. Exercise testing or other direct or indirect challenges are used in diagnosis. In elite athletes, direct airway challenges may not reveal exercise-induced asthma, so indirect surrogate challenges must be used to confirm diagnosis."
9781908541062,ch_11,"A 'Trap' is a cytokine inhibitor that uses different high-affinity receptor components to bind the target ligand . This recombinant molecule (rilonacept) binds to IL-1alpha and IL-1beta and blocks interaction with the IL-1 receptor (Figure 10.1) . A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to IL-1 (canakinumab) is also being tested as a therapy for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . IL-17, first described in 1995, is an attractive target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), though it has been less studied than many of the previously described cytokines . It has pro-inflammatory activity and may be important early in the inflammatory response (see also Chapter 3) . It activates endothelial cells, promoting leukocyte recruitment and activation, and also induces a variety of other inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 . Clinical trials of anti-IL-17 mAbs will determine whether IL-17 inhibition will be as effective as other cytokine inhibitors . Inflammatory and destructive responses require appropriate gene activation . In turn, these genes are activated through cascades of signaling molecules . Janus kinase inhibitors . JAK3 associates with the common gamma-chain, which is a component of the IL-2 receptor as well as other cytokine receptors (including IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21) . JAK3 plays a crucial role in regulating leukocyte function, becoming activated following IL-2 binding to the IL-2 receptor . Once activated, JAK3 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the receptor, leading to the recruitment of specific signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) . Clinical trials of JAK inhibitors in patients with RA have yielded encouraging results, both from efficacy and toxicity standpoints . These are chemically synthesized orally bioavailable drugs, which provides a potential advantage over biological therapies . Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), an intracellular tyrosine kinase, is a key mediator of Fcgamma receptor, B cell receptor and toll-like receptor signaling . All three of these pathways are of potential pathogenic significance in RA and an orally bioavailable SYK inhibitor is being studied in RA, with encouraging results to date . Gene therapy . Some of the biological therapies, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), are limited by an extremely short half-life . Gene therapy provides a potential means of overcoming the requirement for daily injections . Advances in surgery . Therapeutic tolerance . Translation to the clinic has been slow, but over recent years there have been major advances both in the application of tolerogenic therapies, and in their monitoring . A number of cellular therapies are also being developed as potential tolerogenic agents . These include purified and expanded regulatory T cells, tolerogenic dendritic cells and mesenchymal stem cells which, in addition to their tissue engineering potential (see below), also have powerful immunomodulatory properties . Stem cell biology . Pre-RA . Chapter 2 highlighted that circulating autoantibodies appear many years before the onset of RA symptoms . Clinical trials of many therapies have demonstrated optimal results in early disease and attention is starting to turn to the preclinical phase of RA for two reasons . First, the likelihood of switching off disease and obtaining long-term remission, for example using tolerogenic therapies (see above), appears much higher before disease becomes established . Second, if it were possible to identify individuals with a high likelihood of developing RA, it may be possible to institute preventive measures . The sequencing of the human genome has led to huge advances in understanding the genetics of diseases such as RA (see Chapter 2) . These include DNA silencing by methylation, and transcriptional modification of genes by histone acetylation . A number of important epigenetic modifications have been linked to human disease and, importantly, these processes are readily targetable . Aspects of the RA pathogenic process attributable to epigenetic modification have already been modulated in vitro and drugs that target epigenetic processes will soon be developed for RA . Therapeutic developments . Numerous novel potential targets for biological as well as oral therapies are currently under investigation . ","A large number of drugs are currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); several target novel mediators and pathways, incorporating concepts such as epigenetic modification. Signaling pathway inhibitors are orally active drugs with potencies similar to biological therapies. Their successful passage through phase III trials could have a major impact on RA management. Mesenchymal stem cells have both immunomodulatory and tissue engineering potential. They could develop into an important cellular therapy for diseases such as RA. In the future, rheumatologists may identify and treat patients in the presymptomatic phase of RA, using approaches such as therapeutic tolerance induction."
9781908541086,ch_6,"Some research suggests that the current diagnostic criteria for eating disorders may be too restrictive . Measuring weight . Accurate weight measurements are important when diagnosing an eating disorder . Standard procedures must be followed to record consistent reliable measurements of weight . Signs and symptoms . Medical causes of weight loss other than eating disorders are . Behavioral signs associated with anorexia are shown in Table 4.4 . Physical signs . The typical presenting signs and symptoms are shown in Table 4.5 . The typical patient with bulimia is within the normal weight range for age and height . Behavioral signs associated with bulimia are shown in Table 4.6 . Physical signs . Medical complications include . gastrointestinal disorders or bleeding . These complications are generally more dangerous in patients who are underweight . There is greater risk of eating disorders among competitive athletes than the general age-matched population . Particular signs of an eating disorder in this population include . weight loss . The prevalence of eating disorders in female athletes is especially high . disordered eating . Although these are common symptoms and behavioral indicators of eating disorders, most female athletes do not meet the standard criteria for anorexia or bulimia . Diagnosis in men . Men with eating disorders are less likely than women to seek professional help, as eating disorders are commonly viewed as a 'woman's disease' . However, the number of men seeking treatment for an eating disorder may be increasing . The most common diagnosis of eating disorders among men is 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' (EDNOS) . Notably, men with an eating disorder - particularly bulimia or binge-eating disorder - may be more likely to have a substance-abuse problem . When questioned effectively, men with eating disorders will report . A significant yet undocumented proportion of patients with eating disorders have a history of being overweight . body dissatisfaction experienced by these patients is usually reinforced by the encouragement of weight-loss behaviors, even if these are unhealthy . Physicians should actively screen obese patients for eating disorders, and should encourage healthy eating practices, gradual weight loss and moderation in prescribed lifestyle changes (see Fast Facts: Obesity) . Although diabetes, particularly type 2, is more prevalent in men, comorbidity of eating disorders and diabetes is seen mostly in women . Along with the diagnostic purging behaviors, diabetic patients may also reduce their insulin doses in attempts to control their weight . The co-occurrence of eating disorders with other psychiatric syndromes has been documented in numerous studies . A large sample of mixed adults and adolescents from such a clinic found that about 63% of all patients with an eating disorder had experienced an affective disorder at some time . obsessive-compulsive disorder . borderline personality disorder (more common in bulimia) . The assessment of eating disorders remains a complex clinical task, because the disorders present as a mix of disturbances in multiple domains with overlapping symptoms . Structured interviews enable the reliable and valid assessment of the key behavioral features and associated psychopathology of eating disorders . The main screening tools for assessment of eating disorders are shown in Table 4.8 . Screening instruments for children include the child versions of the Eating Disorders Examination (EDE), the Eating Attitude Test (EAT), and the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) (see Table 4.8), as well as the Kids Eating Disorder Survey . In addition, various websites that screen for eating disorders have recently been promoted on college campuses in the USA . After ensuring that the patient's weight loss is not due to a medical condition, the major considerations are . psychotic disorder involving paranoid or delusional beliefs regarding eating or weight . obsessive-compulsive disorder involving rituals about food and weight that are undesired or in conflict with the patient's self-perception . The most common differential diagnoses of bulimia are . binge-eating disorder . gastrointestinal disorders . Anorexia may also involve bingeing and purging, but not as consistently as bulimia . Patients with anorexia must be at least 15% below the expected bodyweight, whereas there is often weight fluctuation and no recognizable weight loss in patients with bulimia . It is therefore important to question both the patient and the parents . Questions to ask the patient and parents to aid diagnosis are listed in Table 4.1 . ","Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 provide specific criteria for the diagnosis of bulimia and anorexia. Structured interviews allow the reliable and valid assessment of the key behavioral features and associated psychopathology of eating disorders. Patients with eating disorders are likely to present with profound weight loss or weight fluctuations, malnutrition and a number of medical complications associated with recurrent vomiting, as well as social problems. Comorbid psychological problems include depression, anxiety and obsessive behavior, and substance misuse in patients with bulimia. Laboratory tests may help to identify the degree of electrolyte imbalance caused by frequent purging and to determine overall nutritional status and need for hospitalization."
9781908541901,ch_6,"Clinical presentation . rest angina - occurs when the patient is at rest and usually lasts for more than 20 minutes . Some patients can have two or more causes . Patients with high risk should be considered for early invasive management, while a conservative strategy is indicated for low-risk patients (Table 4.3) . An overview of the conservative and invasive treatment strategies for patients with UA/NSTEMI is provided in Figure 4.2 . Invasive treatment . The rationale for this more aggressive approach is the protective effect of revascularization on ischemic outcomes in high-risk patients . In patients needing CABG, scheduling should also be based on coronary anatomy . Bleeding risk . The most common side effect of ASA treatment is gastrointestinal intolerance, which occurs in 5-40% of patients . Clopidogrel is recommended for patients who are allergic to, or who cannot tolerate, ASA . It is extensively used in dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in addition to ASA in high-risk patients with CAD . Clopidogrel therapy is pharmacodynamically effective in about 65% of patients; about one-third of patients will have high platelet reactivity that is influenced by the carriage of SNPs (see Chapter 7) . Prasugrel was especially effective in patients with diabetes and high-risk patients with recurrent thromboembolic events, and in reducing stent thrombosis . Prasugrel should not be initiated in patients likely to undergo urgent CABG . In addition, ticagrelor did not demonstrate a superior effect in patients with UA . All of the GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors have been associated with an increase in bleeding compared with treatment with heparin alone . Clinial trial results . These older studies supported the upstream use of a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor in combination with ASA and an anticoagulant in high-risk patients with ACS . The ACUITY trial examined the optimal strategy for the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in moderate- and high-risk NSTE-ACS patients undergoing early invasive therapy . The lack of significant efficacy and increased bleeding in the trial have affected recent guidelines for routine early GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor administration in NSTE-ACS patients . Patients with renal insufficiency may require lower-dose LMWHs since they are renally cleared . International guidelines recommend bivalirudin as a first-line anticoagulant in patients with ACS undergoing coronary intervention . Dabigatran therapy was associated with significant benefits compared with warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation . Despite limited evidence of benefit on clinical outcome, nitroglycerin is widely used in patients with UA/NSTEMI . In patients with refractory angina or heart failure, intravenous administration is preferred . Early intravenous beta-blocker therapy should be avoided in hemodynamically unstable patients and patients with heart failure but should be considered at the time of admission for hemodynamically stable patients with hypertension or tachycardia . Long-term use of ACE inhibitors is also indicated in patients with high-risk chronic CAD . Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are generally reserved for patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors . Valsartan and captopril are equally effective for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events after MI . High-risk patient groups . Elderly patients with NSTE-ACS are less likely to undergo an invasive strategy . Management strategies in elderly patients should be based on ischemic and bleeding risk, estimated life expectancy, comorbidities, quality of life, patient wishes, and the estimated risks and benefits of revascularization . GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors are primarily restricted to patients with elevated troponin levels and a high likelihood of CAD . Patients with diabetes mellitus . Nearly one quarter of patients with UA/NSTEMI have diabetes . CAD is more severe among patients with diabetes and accounts for 75% of all deaths in this group . The following are recommended in diabetic patients with UA/NSTEMI . early invasive strategy in patients with single-vessel disease . CABG for patients with multivessel disease and inducible ischemia . Patients with chronic kidney disease . Renal dysfunction is also independently associated with bleeding risk in patients with ACS . ","Although the in-hospital mortality is higher in patients with STEMI than those with UA/NSTEMI, the 6-month mortality rates are similar and the 4-year mortality rates are two times higher in patients with UA/NSTEMI. Early invasive strategy followed promptly by revascularization is increasingly preferred over conservative strategy. Antithrombotic therapy is a fundamental strategy in patients with UA/NSTEMI; however, proper risk assessment is essential to determine an optimal strategy that achieves a maximum anti-ischemic effect associated with an acceptable bleeding risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) and a P2Y receptor blocker is the standard of care in patients with UA/NSTEMI; however, optimal duration of therapy is controversial. Guidelines uniformly recommend starting all UA/NSTEMI patients (without contraindications) on an anticoagulant as soon as possible after presentation. The benefits of triple therapy of ASA, P2Y receptor blocker and warfarin/oral anticoagulant have not been clearly established. The role of direct oral anticoagulants for long-term therapy is being studied in large-scale trials. Since patients with UA/NSTEMI have a high risk of recurrent ischemic events, active long-term management strategies are crucial."
9781908541727,ch04,"The clinical assessment of a patient with double vision (diplopia) is complex, and it is very difficult for non-ophthalmologists to accurately differentiate between serious and non-serious causes . Causes of double vision . If a patient has double vision they see two images of a single object . Many adults with double vision have an ischemic third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy, which will usually resolve spontaneously within a few months . New-onset double vision is also a common presenting symptom of potentially fatal brain aneurysms, brain tumors, stroke, myasthenia gravis or temporal arteritis . Brain aneurysms in particular can rupture, causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and may kill the patient within hours of the onset of double vision if they are not immediately diagnosed and treated . Orbit and extraocular muscle disease . Orbital fractures may cause diplopia by entrapment of, or damage to, the eye muscles . Thyroid eye disease causes swelling of the extraocular muscles and orbital connective tissue, pushing the eyeball forward (proptosis) and often causing restricted movement of the eye along with diplopia (Figure 4.1) . The eye muscles are also less commonly affected by infection or autoimmune inflammation of other causes . Orbital tumors may also present with diplopia . Most patients with myasthenia say that their double vision varies from day to day, and is often worst at the end of the day . Cranial nerve palsies (CN 3, 4 and/or 6) . The most common cause of diplopia in patients over 50 is an ischemic third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy; this is usually due to diabetes or atherosclerosis . Another important cause in this age group, which should be excluded, is temporal arteritis . Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy . In either of these presentations, the pupil constrictor muscle, which is also innervated by the third nerve, may be affected (causing a dilated pupil that constricts poorly to light) or unaffected . Partial third nerve palsy may not be obvious, as it can present as a subtle vertical muscle imbalance (one eye higher than the other) or one eye turned out with horizontal, vertical or oblique double vision . A complete third nerve palsy presents with a complete ptosis (the eyelid is closed) (Figure 4.2) . Posterior communicating artery aneurysm causes up to a third of all third nerve palsies (partial or complete) . The most common cause overall of third nerve palsy is ischemia . Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy . The palsy causes superior oblique weakness, resulting in the affected eye being higher than the unaffected eye . Initially, the eye also rotates outwards, causing a torsional double vision . Fourth cranial nerve palsy may be congenital, and often presents as head tilt in children . Acquired fourth nerve palsy is often due to blunt head trauma . Ischemia is also a common cause of fourth nerve palsy . It can also be caused, rarely, by a brain tumor . The palsy causes lateral rectus weakness; the eye turns in and cannot turn out fully towards the ear (Figure 4.3), which results in horizontal double vision . Common causes include ischemia (atherosclerosis, diabetes or temporal arteritis); less common causes include raised intracranial pressure and brain tumors . Brain disease . Brain tumors may cause third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy (see above) . Disease of higher brain centers can also cause complicated eye movement disorders . Temporal arteritis is a sight- and life-threatening disease that only affects patients over 50 . It is not uncommon for the patient to complain of intermittent double vision that has disappeared by the time they see a doctor (with a normal eye examination) . Alternatively, they may present with a third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy . Urgent referral may save the patient's sight or their life . Double vision after trauma . Causes of double vision after eye or head trauma include orbital fractures or bruising; third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy due to the initial head trauma or secondary to an expanding intracranial hemorrhage; or brain damage causing an eye movement disorder . ","Urgently refer all patients (of any age) with new-onset double vision to an ophthalmologist, ideally to be seen the same day. Double vision may be due to disease of the orbit, extraocular muscles, neuromuscular junction, ocular motor nerves or brain. It is often very difficult to accurately diagnose the cause on examination. Brain aneurysms - which can be fatal if they are not urgently diagnosed and treated - are a not infrequent cause of double vision in adults; patients often present with partial or complete third nerve palsy. Pupil size is not a reliable indicator of whether an aneurysm is present. Overall, the most common cause of diplopia in adults is ischemic third, fourth or sixth cranial nerve palsy. Temporal arteritis should always be excluded."
9781910797082,ch09,"Psoriatic arthritis is a common autoimmune inflammatory condition affecting the joints and entheses (insertion sites of tendons and ligaments) of patients with psoriasis . The disease is underdiagnosed and often undertreated . Recent advances in therapy offer the prospect of more complete disease control, including the prevention of joint destruction . Clinical manifestations . Although psoriatic arthritis may present in adolescence, onset is most common in patients in their 20s or 30s . In 75% of cases, onset of skin disease precedes the development of arthritis, often by a decade or more . In 15% of cases, the onset of skin and joint disease is simultaneous and, in approximately 10% of cases, the joint manifestations precede the appearance of skin lesions . It is especially challenging for the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis when joint manifestations appear before signs of skin disease . Patients with this form of the disease exhibit characteristic inflammatory changes of joint swelling, redness, pain and stiffness, involving five or fewer joints . In some patients, this will be more symmetrical in pattern, similar to rheumatoid arthritis . In some patients, especially early in the disease process, all laboratory and radiographic findings may be normal . Reports of the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis among those with psoriasis have ranged from 6% to 39% . Higher percentages are derived when a more detailed prospective patient analysis is performed, especially in patients with severe psoriasis . Patients with HLA-B27 are more likely to have spine manifestations . The treatment of psoriatic arthritis has been revolutionized by the recent development and use of receptor-targeted therapies, especially anti-TNF medications, for patients with moderate-to-severe disease . Since not all patients respond to these agents or have side effects, or the agents lose efficacy, newer receptor-targeted therapies are being introduced and studied . Indications for systemic therapy . While aggressive disease warrants aggressive therapy with biological agents to prevent premature morbidity and possibly early mortality, patients who have stable milder disease may not need such aggressive treatment . It is therefore important to determine an appropriate therapeutic strategy that takes into account patient and disease characteristics . It is appropriate to use systemic disease-modifying therapies when one or more of the following pertain . many joints are involved . By contrast, patients with milder disease manifestations may be adequately controlled with NSAID therapy . Long-term therapy with COX-2 inhibitors is therefore quite feasible in patients with mild disease . Disease-modifying agents . Clinical experience indicates that these doses can yield clinically meaningful improvements in both joint and skin disease . An extremely rare side effect is acute interstitial lung disease . Side effects with this drug are usually minimal . Receptor-targeted therapies . Anti-TNF agents . These agents work quickly as well as effectively in most patients . Risk profile . Other receptor-targeted therapies have been, are currently being or are soon to be tested in psoriasis, two of which have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis . Apremilast, an oral inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), has been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis . A proportion of patients may experience nausea, diarrhea and headache . Several inhibitors of IL-17 that have shown dramatic efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis are being evaluated for psoriatic arthritis . Ixekizumab, another direct IL-17A inhibitor, is also entering Phase 3 development in psoriatic arthritis . A direct IL-6 inhibitor, clazakizumab, is in Phase 2 development in psoriatic arthritis . An IL-1 inhibitor, anakinra, failed to show efficacy in psoriatic arthritis . Tofacitinib has demonstrated efficacy in Phase 3 trials in psoriasis and is being studied in psoriatic arthritis . Treatment approaches . Many patients with psoriatic arthritis are managed primarily by a dermatologist - or in some situations by their primary care physician - for the skin manifestations of their disease . These physicians therefore have a unique opportunity to recognize joint disease and potentially initiate treatment . At the very least, it is imperative that all the physicians involved remain alert to the possibility of joint disease since, in a proportion of patients, progressive joint destruction will occur in the absence of effective therapy . ","Psoriatic arthritis is often underdiagnosed and undertreated; however, it is important to recognize this disease because advances in therapy offer the prospect of more complete disease control. The classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis are highly specific and sensitive. Traditional oral therapies may be effective for some clinical domains of psoriatic arthritis. All available anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and demonstrate significant ability to control signs and symptoms, improve function and quality of life, and inhibit progression of structural damage of joints. New therapies with a different mechanism of action from TNF inhibition, ustekinumab and apremilast, have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis; other promising therapies are in development. Optimal management requires a team approach between dermatologist, rheumatologist and primary care provider."
9781910797150,ch07,"Barriers to CINV prevention and control . Despite clear international guidelines on the optimal use of antiemetic regimens for the prevention and control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), these symptoms are still estimated to affect 35-50% of patients who undergo chemotherapy even with the use of effective antiemetic agents . Several issues continue to limit the effectiveness of CINV prevention and management . underestimation of the incidence of CINV by healthcare professionals and/or the effect it has on patients' quality of life . concerns about the adverse effects and/or costs of antiemetic treatments . lack of monitoring of patients in the 5 days immediately following chemotherapy . under-reporting of the incidence of CINV by patients . poor adherence to prescribed antiemetic medications . Underestimating incidence and effect . A recent multinational European survey, aimed at verifying the incidence of CINV and the corresponding antiemetic treatment patterns, showed there is a perceptual gap between patients and physicians/oncology nurses, particularly in terms of the occurrence of nausea and the impact CINV has on patients' quality of life . In total, 947 individuals (375 physicians, 186 oncology nurses and 386 patients) participated in the survey . Sixty percent of patients reported experiencing nausea only, 14% reported nausea and vomiting, and 4% reported vomiting only . Although, in this survey, the physicians and oncology nurses overestimated the incidence of CINV, they underestimated its effect on patients' quality of life . Prescribing concerns . In total, 76% of the physicians in the European survey described above prescribed guideline-directed CINV prophylaxis for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) . This decreased to 15% for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), while 86% prescribed no or minimal antiemetic medication for patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy . Adverse effects and costs were cited as key factors in their reluctance to prescribe prophylactic CINV medication . Lack of follow-up . No patient monitoring in the 5-day period following chemotherapy was reported by 27% of physicians and 33% of oncology nurses, and was confirmed by half of the patients . Under-reporting by patients . The main reason for not reporting CINV in the European survey was a general perception by 51% of patients that nausea and vomiting is an inevitable consequence of chemotherapy that had to be tolerated . In another study, 37% of patients said they wanted 'to be strong by not complaining' about their symptoms . Only 38% of patients in the European survey reported full adherence to the guidelines given to them by their physicians/oncology nurses when self-administering antiemetic medication . Opportunties for improving CINV prevention and control . There are a number of institutional or clinic operational procedures that may address the issues above, and improve the quality of care of patients receiving chemotherapy . Better prescribing . Studies have shown that oncology nurses and nurse practitioners can have a key role in influencing the selection of the antiemetic regimen, and it is important that they are aware of the latest antiemetic guidelines and the factors that put patients at risk for CINV . In a multidisciplinary team, communication between oncology nurses, palliative care nurses, pharmacists and clinicians about the antiemetic regimen and the patient's progress is essential . Patient education . Clinicians should reassure patients that the incidence or severity of CINV is not an indicator of the effectiveness of their chemotherapy and that nausea and vomiting should not be considered a normal part of treatment . Furthermore, it is important to discuss the likelihood and management of adverse effects of antiemetic treatment and emphasize the importance of continuing the medications at home and completing the full course of treatment . Minimizing the pill burden and eliminating the requirement to swallow medication can also improve patient adherence to treatment . Improved follow-up . It is important to assess symptoms throughout therapy, as patient response to antiemetic treatment may change over time and may require adjustment of the antiemetic regimen . Telephone follow-up by oncology nurses with patients 24-48 hours after chemotherapy will provide important patient information as well as suggested treatment for unreported breakthrough CINV . Given the high incidence of nausea only experienced by patients, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of nausea and new approaches to its treatment are required . ","Issues that may reduce the effectiveness of CINV control by healthcare professionals include underestimation of the incidence of CINV, concerns about the adverse effects and cost of antiemetic agents, and insufficient following up after chemotherapy. Patient factors that may reduce the effectiveness of CINV control include under-reporting of symptoms and poor adherence to medications. Incorporating antiemetic guidelines in electronic medical record prescribing orders may help to ensure prescription of optimal antiemetic regimens by healthcare professionals. Clinicians must emphasize the importance of continuing medications at home and completing the full course of treatment. Telephone follow-up by oncology nurses with patients 24-48 hours after chemotherapy will provide important patient information."
9781910797082,ch08,"The driving T-cell population in psoriatic lesions is activated memory effector T cells . To reach the effector state, T cells must first be activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) . non-specific reversible binding of the T cell to the APC through interactions of surface molecules on the two cells . recognition of the major histocompatibility complex molecule on the APC by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor . Once the T cells have been activated by the APC, they enter the bloodstream and migrate back to the skin . Initial skin activation is required for APCs to migrate from the skin and interact with T cells (proinflammatory state) . Similarly, chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines are needed for T cells to enter the skin . These chemokines and cytokines are derived from endogenous skin cells (exempli gratia dendritic cells, macrophages, keratinocytes) as well as recruited cells . As specific details of the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis have been elucidated, new therapies have been developed that target the aberrant immune cells and molecules that trigger the development of psoriatic plaques . Receptor-targeted therapies have been in clinical studies and usage for a wide range of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders since 1997, but for psoriasis since 2003 . They are designed specifically to interfere with T-cell activation and effector function in order to prevent the inflammatory effects characteristic of this group of diseases .

There are four major ways in which the various biologics are active against psoriasis (Table 8.2) . elimination of pathogenic T cells . blockade of T-cell activation/costimulation/migration . alteration of T-cell proliferative signals/immune deviation . blocking proinflammatory effector cytokines . Elimination of pathogenic T cells . This agent eliminated pathogenic T cells by binding to CD2 on T cells to block costimulation by LFA3 on APCs (see Figure 8.1) . Blockade of T-cell activation/costimulation/migration . The LFA1-ICAM1 interaction is also involved in T-cell migration into inflamed tissue, and was a second mechanism of action against psoriasis for this drug . Blocking proinflammatory effector cytokines . Four agents are available to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis: three TNFalpha-blocking drugs (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) and one anti-IL-12/23 agent (ustekinumab) . It binds soluble and cell-surface TNFalpha and TNFalpha . There is increasing evidence that IL-17 is also a desirable therapeutic target for psoriasis treatment . Smaller ACR 20 responses in psoriatic arthritis have been noted with these three IL-17 agents compared with the currently approved TNFalpha drugs . Role of receptor-targeted therapies . Receptor-targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis since their introduction in 2003 . Individual drugs may prove to induce sustained drug-free remission rates that are generally longer than with the three traditional agents; likewise, rebound after discontinuation is significantly less evident . Five-year safety data are now available for ustekinumab, with over 70 000 patients having been exposed to this biological agent since its introduction . While the goal for patients is long-term disease-free remissions and improved quality of life, overall cost and long-term safety will be key issues in determining the significance of biological therapies in the treatment of psoriasis . As the three TNFalpha agents lose patent protection, these biosimilar drugs are likely to ensure that more psoriasis patients are exposed to less expensive, equally safe and efficacious agents . ","Receptor-targeted therapies ('biologics') target specific molecules involved in the immunopathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. The biologics currently available or in clinical trials are all given by injection (subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous). Evidence to date suggests that biologics have fewer organ-specific toxic effects than traditional systemic agents. Reduction in the inflammatory systemic components of other organs (exempli gratia joints and heart) is a positive development. A number of exciting new agents are in various stages of development and clinical trials. Cost and long-term safety will be important in determining the future role of biologics in the treatment of psoriasis. Biosimilar agents, soon to be introduced, could help to reduce cost issues considerably."
9781908541406,ch_9,"VWF is synthesized in endothelial cells as a polypeptide of 2813 amino acids . VWF protein is synthesized by endothelial cells and released into the plasma . Bone marrow megakaryocytes synthesize VWF, which is packaged into the developing platelet alpha-granules . VWF stabilizes FVIII in the circulation; in patients with von Willebrand disease, the half-life of FVIII is shortened and the plasma concentration of FVIII is decreased . For a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease to be made, the plasma levels of normally functioning VWF must be reduced or a structurally abnormal molecule with altered function must be present . The VWF protein can be characterized by a number of different laboratory techniques that assess its concentration and function by a variety of methods . To establish a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease many of the tests in Table 7.1 are required . It should be noted that 35% of people diagnosed with von Willebrand disease do not demonstrate reduced VWF on retesting . The levels of FVIII and VWF are related to blood group . Often, referral to a specialized center is needed for additional tests to clarify the diagnosis, including collagen binding assay, platelet VWF studies and DNA sequencing of the VWF gene . In some patients with normal or borderline VWF levels, a primary platelet disorder should be considered, as the clinical presentation of bleeding can be identical . In this situation, platelet function should be evaluated (see Chapter 4) . The various abnormalities in VWF have been classified into several subtypes (Table 7.2) . Type 1 accounts for 80% of cases . Plasma concentration of a structurally normal VWF is reduced; thus, the ratio of VWF:RCo to VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) is normal (> 0.5-0.7) . Type 2 is characterized by a structural abnormality in VWF, so that in most of these types (except 2N), the ratio of VWF:RCo to VWF:Ag is less than 0.5 . Type 2A: a loss of high-molecular weight-multimers . Type 2M: the VWF has decreased ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation but the high-molecular-weight multimers are present in normal amounts . Type 2N (Normandy) is due to an abnormality at the FVIII binding site on the VWF protein . The condition phenotypically resembles mild hemophilia A, because all the commonly measured VWF activities are normal . It can only be diagnosed by measuring FVIII binding to the patient's VWF in vitro . In type 3, the level of VWF in all assays is less than 10% and FVIII is similarly reduced making the diagnosis straightforward in most cases . Although the majority of cases of von Willebrand disease are genetic and a bleeding tendency becomes apparent by adolescence, occasionally patients present with a recent history of abnormal bleeding due to decreased plasma VWF . Desmopressin therapy is appropriate for many patients with von Willebrand disease (Table 7.3) . In type 2A, although the VWF level may rise in response to desmopressin, the circulating VWF molecules are not functionally very effective and they may also be cleared rapidly . Desmopressin is therefore contraindicated in type 2B . Although desmopressin will increase the concentration of VWF in type 2N disease, it is important to determine the duration of the beneficial effect, and particularly the duration of the elevation in FVIII . In type 3, desmopressin is clinically ineffective, as any response is modest and short lived . Treatment with a concentrate containing VWF is necessary for patients with major bleeding or about to undergo major surgery . Sufficient VWF should be infused so that levels of 100% are achieved and maintained for 7-10 days . If the levels of FVIII exceed 250%, the dose of the concentrate should be decreased or a FVIII-free concentrate of VWF infused . All patients with von Willebrand disease should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B viruses . Before 1990, some patients with von Willebrand disease treated with multiple infusions of cryoprecipitate or VWF-containing FVIII concentrates became infected with hepatitis C virus or occasionally with HIV . Recombinant VWF concentrations are currently undergoing clinical evaluation . ","All patients with von Willebrand disease should be characterized by laboratory investigation as fully as possible. Desmopressin is safe and effective therapy for many patients. When a clotting factor concentrate is indicated, it should contain high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor."
9781912776238,ch6,"Safety data for a biosimilar are likely to be limited at the time of launch . However, experience to date indicates that the adverse event profiles of biosimilars match those of their originators . Indeed, safety monitoring within the European Union (EU) since the introduction of biosimilars has not identified any relevant difference in the nature, severity or frequency of adverse effects between biosimilars and their reference medicines . The comparability studies performed on biosimilars mean that the risk of new or severe adverse events (type 2) is likely to be lower than with a novel biological agent . Immunogenicity is a potential safety concern with any biological agent, and even slight changes in structural properties or impurities could, in theory, trigger an adverse immune reaction . This is not only a direct safety issue, but underlies the anxieties over biosimilar brand switching, as differences in anti-drug antibody levels between two drug brands, or between different manufacturing process variants of the same brand, could create a loss of drug efficacy after switching . Product drift over time and evolution through manufacturing changes may produce structural differences in a reference biologic, meaning that no biologic can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . Immunogenicity cannot yet be predicted from analytic or animal studies with sufficient accuracy for biological medicines . For this reason, clinical studies in humans remain a current requirement for biosimilar medicines (though not routinely required for a biological drug undergoing a manufacturing change or small molecule generics) . Regulators are keen to identify differences in toxic potential such as acute anaphylaxis or reductions in efficacy through the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies that increase the clearance of the drug . Immunogenicity is monitored both pre- and postmarketing . Biosimilars do not have to show that they have no immunogenicity - just that the levels are similar to those of the originator . Concerns about immunogenicity appear to be generally unfounded and, as discussed on page 75, European-approved biosimilars have not been associated with any increase in the incidence of such adverse events, similar to the US position . Figure 6.1 illustrates immunogenicity data for biosimilar adalimumab . In contrast to the situation with biosimilars, documented immunogenicity differences with clinical impact have been reported for originator medicines undergoing manufacturing changes and with intended-copy biological drugs from less-regulated medical regions of the world . Clinical studies on a biosimilar prior to authorization are generally limited and, as for any new drug, postmarketing surveillance is required to enable identification of any rare adverse effects . Biosimilars are subject to the same degree of post-approval pharmacovigilance as the originator biologic . Crucial to this is product naming, as biosimilars and originators share the same international non-propriety drug name (INN) . In 2010, Europe updated its pharmacovigilance guidance requiring member states to encourage the use of brand names in prescribing, health records and adverse event reporting . For example, product-specific attribution of epoetins is near 99%, and overall is 96% . However, such success has not been universal: for example, of 19 adverse event reports in the Australian Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN) for filgrastim from 2011 to 2014, the full brand name was reported in only 11 (58%) . This is an issue that affects originator medicines as well - in the USA, for example, brand name reporting for different insulins was only 84% in the MedWatch system . In February 2019, a further step in the traceability of biologics was signaled in Europe with the final implementation of the Falsified Medicines Directive . Prior to full implementation, the European barcode standards could not automatically generate dynamic product information, such as batch numbers and expiry dates . Special reporting requirements may apply to biosimilars, even though they are versions of established originator brands, and they may likewise be assigned a black warning triangle requiring prescribers to report any adverse drug reactions . A risk minimization plan (RMP) is also a requirement for marketing a biosimilar; details are provided in the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) . Real-world studies . Observational real-world pharmacoepidemiology data may be available for the originator biologic; the European Medicines Agency (EMA) encourages biosimilar manufacturers to participate in these studies, if available, or to begin a new program . ","The risk of new or severe adverse events is likely to be lower with a biosimilar than with a novel biological agent. Adoption of the naming conventions and accurate reporting is key to effective surveillance and the identification of any rare adverse events that emerge post launch. 2D DataMatrix barcodes, with batch numbers and expiry dates, can be used to track biologics at all points in the supply chain. Slight changes in a product can result in immunogenicity profile changes, but this applies to all biological medicines and not just biosimilars."
9781910797471,ch04,"The reported prevalence of anemia varies widely, but approximately 37% of congestive HF patients are affected . Clinical characteristics associated with anemia in the HF population are listed in Table 4.1 . Iron deficiency in the chronic HF population has a reported prevalence of 5-21% . Anemia of chronic disease is a form of anemia that occurs during chronic illness in response to inflammatory processes . Blood transfusion may be appropriate in an acute setting for selected patients with severe anemia . Recently, intravenous iron replacement has been shown to improve symptoms, quality of life and exercise capacity in iron-deficient patients with chronic HF . Trials of ESAs have shown an increased risk of thrombosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (and increased all-cause mortality in trials of patients with malignancy) . Pulmonary disease . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common comorbidity in patients with HF, with a prevalence of 10-46% . Conversely, up to 20% of patients with COPD may have undiagnosed HF and up to 40% may have evidence of some LV systolic dysfunction . It also increases the risk of developing HF by 50% . In patients with HF, COPD increases non-cardiovascular mortality and the overall hospitalization rate . Restrictive ventilatory defects are frequent in patients with compensated HF . They mask hyperinflation and obscure diagnosis of COPD in patients with HF . Prevention and treatment . Respiratory infections are associated with HF decompensation in 10-16% of admissions . Pneumococcal and influenza A vaccinations of elderly patients with HF reduce the rate of hospitalization and associated costs . Sleep-disordered breathing in the form of obstructive (OSA) or central sleep apnea (CSA) is common in patients with HF (affecting 40-70% of patients) . increased sympathetic drive . inflammatory effects - an increase in NFKB1 transcription . A similar association has not been observed in patients without cardiac ischemia . Therapy for sleep-disordered breathing in patients with HF may include . servo-adaptive ventilation (in patients with predominant CSA) . However, up to 30% of patients may not be able to tolerate it . Renal disease . Renal dysfunction is frequently found in patients hospitalized with HF and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality . Up to 50% of ambulatory patients with stable HF have some degree of renal dysfunction . Moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction in patients with HF increases the relative mortality risk by 100% (absolute risk > 50% at 5 years) . It is generally accepted that renal dysfunction is a marker of progressive HF . CRS type 2 (chronic) - chronic HF leading to chronic kidney disease . In general, careful patient selection and monitoring are crucial . These drugs should not be initiated in patients with CRS type 3 or known bilateral renal artery stenosis . Liver disease . Transient abnormalities in liver function tests are relatively common in patients with chronic congestive HF . Acute ischemic hepatitis has been reported in patients with acute cardiac dysfunction (either new or decompensated chronic HF) . Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy may occur in patients with hepatic cirrhosis; it should be suspected in patients with worsening hemodynamic status . The illness is fairly common among patients with HF, with a reported prevalence of 10-25% in outpatients and 35-70% in inpatients . Most patients have mild symptoms, with fewer than 20% experiencing moderate or severe depression . Interestingly, patients with major depression are twice as likely to develop clinical HF over the course of their illness compared with patients without a mood disorder . A stronger risk was found in depressed patients with systolic hypertension . It is therefore not unexpected that depression in patients with HF is independently associated with poor prognosis, increased mortality and readmissions to hospital, and use of more medical resources . There are several proposed mechanisms by which depression leads to clinical deterioration and results in worse outcomes in patients with HF . poor patient adherence . Initial screening in patients with HF may include the two questions from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2 . ","Patients with heart failure (HF) should undergo regular monitoring for early diagnosis of anemia and appropriate investigation to determine the cause. Therapeutic intervention should be tailored to the individual, taking into account the velocity of hemoglobin fall, the presence or absence of concomitant renal dysfunction and the cause of the anemia. Despite inherent diagnostic limitations it is important for clinicians to establish the presence of pulmonary disease and to introduce early therapy for both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HF in order to limit their negative impact on morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing is important as treatment with continuous positive airway pressure in symptomatic patients is effective. HF therapy is challenging in the context of comorbid renal disease, as vasodilators may precipitate an increase in serum creatinine and potassium levels; however, current evidence supports the use of these drugs in patients with CRS type 1 providing the initial increase in serum creatinine and potassium are less than 30% and 5.6 mmol/L, respectively. Acute ischemic hepatitis may develop in HF with low-output state and is generally reversible. Clinical depression is not uncommon in patients with HF and is associated with a marked increase in HF morbidity and mortality. Initial screening for depression is therefore important."
9781910797457,chp6,"Recurrence after initial surgery or radiotherapy usually manifests as a rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) . A prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scan (see page 52) may reveal sites of cancer recurrence at very low PSA levels, typically in the prostate bed (after prostatectomy), within the prostate (after radiotherapy) or in more distant lymph nodes or bone sites . Less commonly, pulmonary metastases may be detected . The likelihood of having a positive PSMA PET scan at various PSA levels is shown in Figure 6.1 . If the site of recurrence can be identified, appropriate therapy can then be delivered . Recurrence after prostatectomy . Risk factors for recurrence include . lymph node metastases at the time of surgery . higher-grade cancer (Gleason score >= 8) . The PSA level should reliably fall to below 0.1 ng/mL after prostatectomy . The recommendations for cut-off values that indicate cancer recurrence range from 0.2 to 0.5 ng/mL . If the PSA level does not fall below this level within 6 weeks of surgery, systemic disease should be suspected . Cancer recurrence is confirmed if the PSA level is above the cut-off and rising with sequential measurements, but time to metastasis and death is variable and is often quite prolonged . On average, a patient with recurrence of raised PSA will develop metastases over a median of 8 years, with death 5 years after the development of metastases . A number of factors determine how fast the cancer recurrence actually progresses . time to recurrence after prostatectomy - a shorter time to recurrence is associated with faster disease progression . doubling of the PSA level in less than 3 months is associated with shorter time to metastases and death . When only a raised PSA level is seen, it is not known whether the recurrence is local (in the prostate bed) or systemic (metastases) . A number of choices are available for the management of PSA recurrence, including watchful waiting, salvage radiotherapy and hormonal therapy . It should be remembered that, in the average patient, metastases do not develop until 8 years after a PSA rise is detected, with death 5 years later . This treatment can be offered to men who have recurrence in the prostate bed or at distant metastatic sites confirmed by PSMA PET . Salvage radiotherapy is a potentially curative treatment for men with a high likelihood of residual cancer in the prostatic bed . It is also more effective if PSMA PET confirms that the prostate bed is the only site of recurrence . Hormonal therapy is reserved for men who have progressive PSA rises and are unlikely to harbor isolated local recurrence, or have confirmed widespread metastatic disease . The timing for initiation of hormonal therapy in these men is controversial, however . A recent randomized trial has shown that immediate hormonal therapy for PSA recurrence resulted in better overall survival (OS) than delayed treatment . Recurrence following radiation therapy . The definition of recurrence is less straightforward after radiation treatment than after surgery, and the natural history of PSA recurrence is less clear after radiation than surgery . Currently, recurrence after radiation therapy is defined as a PSA level that is 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir level . PSA doubling time (see page 80) is usually the best predictor of metastatic disease; a PSA doubling time of less than 3 months is associated with a higher risk of death . Once PSA recurrence has been identified, further investigations depend on the individual's circumstances and expectations, and involve determining whether the cancer is in the prostate, systemic or both . There are several options for treatment . Watchful waiting can be offered to men who have limited life expectancy, and/or progression of the cancer is slow . Hormonal therapy is usually reserved for men who do not have isolated localized disease . As when following prostatectomy, hormone therapy for recurrence after radiation therapy improves survival if given early . Oligometastatic disease . Disease is described as oligometastatic when metastases are limited (3-5) . While the results have been somewhat conflicting, only a small proportion of men gain long-term freedom from progression with these salvage therapies . Bone progression made a greater contribution to prostate cancer-specific mortality than progression at other sites . ","Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level should reliably fall to below 0.1 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy. Recurrence after prostatectomy is generally defined as PSA above 0.2 ng/mL and rising. Recurrence after radiation therapy is usually defined as PSA that is at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir. For the average patient, metastases do not develop until 8 years after a PSA rise is detected, with death some 5 years later, so watchful waiting is an appropriate option for some men with recurrence. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT can be used to evaluate men who have a PSA rise after local treatment. Following prostatectomy, patients who have a high likelihood of local disease can be offered salvage radiotherapy. Following radiotherapy, patients who have recurrence in the prostate only may be offered a salvage treatment such as radical prostatectomy, High-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) or cryotherapy, but all of these carry the risk of side effects. Progressive PSA rises following initial therapy suggest micrometastatic disease, which should be treated with hormone therapy; however, the timing of this treatment is controversial. More evidence is needed from clinical trials to inform us of the most effective treatment options in these situations."
9781910797631,chp4,"Recognizing depression . Most people with depression will have initial contact with primary care services and receive ongoing management from primary care practitioners . In the USA, primary care practitioners manage approximately one-half of adults and nearly two-thirds of older adults treated for depression . Clinician recognition . Studies conducted over several decades and in many countries have revealed that depression is missed in primary care consultations - particularly the initial presentation - relatively often . notation in the patient's clinical record of depression as a diagnosis or diagnostic code, or a clear description of depressive symptoms . clinician-rated depression or probable depression on an encounter form, or score sheet, or in response to a face-to-face interview . Non-psychiatric clinicians' specificity of depression recognition - the proportion of non-cases correctly identified as not being depressed - was much higher, with a summary rate of 84% found in this review . There is evidence that recognition and treatment may occur at a subsequent visit . In one study, approximately half of those with unrecognized depression at baseline had some evidence of recognition at 3 months, as indicated by an antidepressant prescription or a mental health referral . Depression recognition can be examined in relation to patient, clinician/provider and context/system factors (Table 4.1) . Patient factors . Duration of depression . Consultation rates and help-seeking patterns are consistently lower in men than in women, and this is particularly evident for psychological problems and depressive symptoms . Effects of depression . For some patients, disclosure of depression during a consultation may be influenced by concerns about mental health problems being noted in their medical record . Mental health literacy . Many depressed primary care patients present exclusively with physical symptoms, which they do not attribute to psychological etiologies . These have mostly involved mass media health campaigns providing details of the features of depression and other mental health problems, together with the message that depression is common, serious and treatable . Depression in health professionals . The high prevalence of depression among health professionals, as noted in Chapter 3, has particular challenges with respect to its recognition and management . Clinician factors . Several studies have shown a link between clinicians' attitudes and their management decisions, and between training courses and primary care physicians' attitudes to the identification and treatment of depression . Overall, clinicians surveyed in a number of European nations felt strongly that depression is amenable to change, and that looking after depressed patients is a rewarding activity . Presentation with concurrent physical problems increases the difficulty of recognizing depression . US primary care providers have been found to be less likely to detect depression among African-American and Hispanic patients than among white patients, particularly if the doctor and patient are of a different race . The limitations of consultation duration are a commonly quoted problem affecting the detection of depression . Improving depression recognition . Several approaches have been identified to improve the quality of depression recognition and management . These have been implemented and evaluated predominantly in primary care, as most people with depression are encountered in this environment . The use of case-finding measures . Given the substantial proportion of cases of depression missed in primary care, the use of case-finding tools is an appealing approach to assist recognition . The Australian and New Zealand Colleges of Psychiatrists and of GPs also advocate this opportunistic approach to depression identification . There appear to be two main problems with screening or case finding for depression . Where case finding is used without additional enhancement of the delivery of care, there is no effect on depression outcomes . Case finding for depression makes better sense and is more likely to be associated with clinical benefits when these two difficulties are addressed, and it is directed at patient groups with increased risks of depression, such as people with long-term physical health problems . The key issue with case finding is ensuring that systems are in place to provide evidence-based support and treatment for those people recognized as depressed . As discussed in Chapter 6, there are considerable deficits in depression treatment and follow-up . Many people who are recognized as depressed are not provided with appropriate treatment, and of those prescribed antidepressant medication more than half discontinue after an inadequate treatment period . Case-finding tools . A large number of case identification tools for depression are available . the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale . the Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition . Attention should be directed to any past history of depression and treatment response, current impairment that may be associated with depression, the presence of particular stressors and the availability of social supports . ","Identifying depression is the necessary first stage to enable ongoing monitoring, risk assessment, support and clinical management; however, many people with depression are not identified in primary care or medical settings. A combination of patient, clinician and contextual factors operate to hinder depression identification, but these factors can all be modified to improve the process of condition recognition. Interventions to improve recognition that do not incorporate changes to the context and organization of care are likely to have only weak effects on depression outcomes. The best evidence indicates the effectiveness of a combined approach involving education for clinicians and patients, systematic use of case-finding tools, and organizational changes to improve depression management capacity and sustain practice changes."
9781912776139,ch6,"A biomarker is a 'characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathological processes or biological response to a therapeutic intervention' . As such, there are several different types of biomarker in ALS . Here, the discussion is limited to potential diagnostic biomarkers: that is, those that reliably distinguish people with ALS from individuals with weakness caused by other disease processes (disease controls) . To date, no such biomarker has been adopted in routine international clinical practice . However, most of the development of biomarkers to date has used healthy controls as the comparator . The distinction of ALS from healthy is not the clinical question facing the physician . Furthermore, the rarity of ALS and its essentially sporadic nature sets the bar extremely high for a diagnostic test that can be applied in the primary care setting . Prospective application of existing biomarker candidates within a specialized clinical setting is required to ensure that they add value to the diagnostic process . Biofluid biomarkers . Neurofilaments, the building blocks for the key cytoskeletal components of nervous system cells, are a leading biological-fluid-based biomarker for ALS . They are relatively stable in biofluids and are easily detected by antibody-based immunoassays . Multiple studies have demonstrated higher CSF NfL and pNfH levels in patients with ALS than in healthy controls and, increasingly, also disease controls . Rising levels also predate the onset of symptoms by several months in studies following asymptomatic carriers of ALS-causing genetic mutations . Blood levels of these proteins are significantly less sensitive than CSF measurements, although neither has yet been adequately validated as a diagnostic biomarker in patients suspected to have ALS . Separately, higher initial levels appear to be associated with faster progression and reduced survival in ALS, supporting a role as a prognostic biomarker . The stability of levels within an individual patient also boosts their potential as a pharmacodynamic biomarker, and many therapeutic trials are now including this measure . The extracellular domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is present in higher concentrations in the urine of patients with ALS than in healthy controls . It was shown to be highly sensitive and specific for the detection of spinal-onset ALS in a small study . Urinary concentrations of the p75NTR extracellular domain have also been shown to rise in genetically susceptible individuals as the disease becomes clinically apparent . The urinary concentrations continue to rise with disease progression . The intuitive goal of a TDP-43-based diagnostic biomarker for ALS, detectable in either CSF or blood, is hampered by the intracellular location of the protein and the limited sensitivity and specificity of antibodies as the basis for assay development . UMN pathology can be difficult to identify on clinical examination early in the disease and TMS may therefore be useful in identifying subclinical UMN disease, facilitating the early diagnosis of ALS . Cortical hyperexcitability is important in the pathogenesis of ALS and can be demonstrated using a paired-pulse paradigm of threshold tracking . A reduction of short-interval intracortical inhibition is most prominent in the early stages of ALS . TMS has now been well validated in ALS and may prove to be an important diagnostic tool in clinical practice . None of these currently has diagnostic application over standard electromyography in ALS but they may prove useful in more objectively assessing disease progression and treatment response . To date, insights have been group based and tools have proved challenging to develop at the level of the individual patient . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a development of structural T2-based MRI that uses quantitative measures of water diffusion to estimate white matter tract integrity . In intact axons, water molecules predominantly diffuse parallel to the main tract direction, along the intact axons . Most water movement is therefore in a restricted direction within the tissue and is referred to as having a high fractional anisotropy . In damaged tissue, the movement of water molecules occurs across the tissue, unrestricted by axon orientation . DTI abnormalities have been consistently observed in the white matter tracts of individuals with ALS, particularly in the corticospinal tracts and corpus callosum, compared with healthy controls . Automated segmentation of gray matter volumes has demonstrated more subtle cortical involvement in ALS . A combination of these structural gray and white matter measures with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI markers of brain activity holds promise for defining a more individualized 'signature' of ALS . ","A diagnostic biomarker of most immediate value in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) would be one that can help the neurologist distinguish atypical (exempli gratia LMN-predominant) cases from other disease states for earlier therapeutic trial enrolment. Neurofilaments are a leading candidate, especially if the blood-based assays become sensitive enough to supersede the need for cerebrospinal fluid testing. Urinary p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) levels have also shown promise. Threshold-tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation is sensitive to the cortical hyperexcitability that characterizes the syndrome of ALS. Motor unit nerve estimation and electrical impedance myography are emerging developments beyond standard electromyography. Multimodal structural and functional brain imaging may provide more sensitive markers of broader motor system dysfunction in the longer term."
9781910797907,chp3,"The differential diagnosis includes a heterogeneous group of hemolytic disorders, both acquired and congenital (Figure 3.1) . This blood work-up helps to define the degree of anemia and the associated symptoms . Hemolytic parameters may vary in the different conditions, thus guiding the differential diagnosis . Acquired hemolytic anemias . Autoimmune hemolytic anemias . The direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or Coombs test) is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemias (AIHAs) . The DAT reveals the presence of anti-erythrocyte antibodies on red blood cells (RBCs) . The DAT tube is the most specific but least sensitive test, whereas microcolumn and solid-phase tests show reduced specificity but increased sensitivity . Types of autoimmune hemolytic anemia . Other acquired hemolytic anemias . There are several other causes of acquired hemolysis (see Figure 3.1a) . Deficiencies in these proteins, which inhibit the activation of complement, result in abnormally elevated susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis . The disease is easily diagnosed by flow cytometry analysis of GPI-deficient cells (PNH clones), and the clinical picture reflects the percentage of cells that are deficient . Three clinical subgroups have been identified . subclinical PNH (clone < 10% and no clinical or laboratory evidence of hemolysis) . Infectious agent-mediated hemolytic anemia . Some of these disorders are associated with infections, including Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, Shigella and HIV . This type of mechanical hemolysis is increasingly seen among recipients of prosthetic heart valves . Drug-induced hemolytic anemia . Congenital hemolytic anemias . Examination of a blood smear is fundamental to guiding the differential diagnosis of congenital hemolytic anemias . This defect results in reduced cell flexibility and premature destruction of spherocytes in the spleen . This form involves a severe functional defect in spectrin (the major cytoskeletal protein of the RBC cell membrane); it is an autosomal recessive disorder, and manifests as a severe hemolytic anemia with thermal instability of RBCs . Typical RBCs known as stomatocytes ('mouth-like' cells) are visible on blood smear examination (Figure 3.6) . Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias . Typically, these anemias have some hemolytic features but an inadequate reticulocytosis . Diagnosis of the congenital dyserythropoietic anemias requires bone marrow evaluation and molecular characterization in most patients . Generally, all RBC enzymopathies are characterized by chronic hemolysis, with the exception of the most common subtypes of G6PD deficiency . In contrast, pyruvate kinase and hexokinase defects display the typical features of chronic hemolysis only . Hemolytic markers of disease . Hyperbilirubinemia during hemolysis is usually no more than 4 mg/dL . mildly elevated in acute hemolytic crises resulting from infections in association with congenital anemias, and in AIHA with complement activation . slightly increased in extravascular hemolysis (seen in warm AIHA and congenital hemolytic disorders) . Moreover, LDH levels may be markedly increased in patients with vitamin B or folic acid deficiency because of ineffective erythropoiesis and premature RBC death . On the other hand, haptoglobin increases in inflammatory diseases, in people who smoke and in nephrotic syndrome, possibly masking an underlying hemolytic condition . Ferritin is increased in chronic hemolytic conditions (membrane defects and enzymopathies, chronic cold agglutinin disease and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia) . It is an acute phase protein and also increases in various metabolic and inflammatory diseases, in hereditary hemochromatosis (even in heterozygous patients), and as a result of transfusion support (which is often given to hemolytic patients) . It is typically associated with marked intravascular hemolysis (PNH, G6PD deficiency) but is also found in reactions to incompatible RBC transfusions, severe burns and infections . ","The differential diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency includes a heterogeneous group of acquired and congenital hemolytic disorders. The direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemias. False-positive and false-negative results should be taken into account. Several infectious, microangiopathic, mechanical, toxic and pharmacological causes of acquired hemolytic anemias should also be considered. Patient history and blood smear examination are fundamental in the diagnosis of congenital membrane defects, including hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and stomatocytosis. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis are recessive anemias to be considered and diagnosed mainly by molecular analysis. A complex group of enzyme defects (mostly recessive) are diagnosed by testing the enzymatic activity in the peripheral blood and by confirming the causative mutation at a molecular level (homozygous or compound heterozygous)."
9781910797433,ch03,"As described in Chapter 1, genetic factors are an important determinant of ovarian cancer risk . Indeed, inherited genetic mutations are associated with about 15% of ovarian cancers, depending on the cancer subtype . Furthermore, some epithelial ovarian cancers result from somatic mutations, as well as mutations in other genes that are critical in DNA repair pathways . Importantly, the absence of a family history of ovarian cancer may not preclude a genetic predisposition: inherited mutations may be present in up to 25% of women with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), but up to half of these women may not have a family history of ovarian or breast cancer . For these reasons, genetic testing has a valuable role to play in identifying women at risk of ovarian cancer . It is important to differentiate between genetic counseling and genetic testing . Most experts stress that informed counseling should be given before genetic testing by a qualified healthcare professional, but not necessarily a genetic counselor . Currently, there is a shortage of counselors to provide timely consultations; hence, some propose direct genetic testing without counseling, with the reflex use of counselors for patients with positive or questionable findings . The development of multiplex gene panel testing to sequence multiple genes simultaneously may identify more individuals with cancer gene mutations than BRCA1 or BRCA2 testing alone . This development, alongside a marked decrease in the cost of genetic testing, means that routine genetic testing is now much more accessible than was previously the case . Guidelines for genetic testing . A number of organizations have published recommendations and guidelines for genetic counseling and testing (also see Further reading, page 31) . Most of these recommend that all women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should undergo genetic testing, irrespective of their family history or age at diagnosis . The majority of guidelines recommend that genetic testing should include both pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor or other appropriate healthcare professional with expertise in cancer genetics . The benefits of genetic testing in patients with ovarian cancer include . prognostic information for counseling . enabling amendments to screening recommendations and patient counseling, including consideration of surgical or non-surgical risk reduction strategies . the opportunity for cascade testing of relatives (see below) . Cascade testing . Cascade testing is the testing of close blood relatives of individuals known to be at high risk of genetic conditions . If a genetic mutation (exempli gratia a BRCA1 mutation) is identified through initial genetic testing of the patient, further testing for this mutation can then be offered to close blood relatives of the affected individual (Figure 3.1) . Using this strategy, it is only necessary to test for the specific mutation, rather than performing multigene testing; as a result, the cost of testing can be significantly reduced . The problem of under-referral . Despite the potential benefits of genetic testing in terms of identifying women at high risk of ovarian cancer, referral rates for genetic counseling services are low . In one study, only 14.5% of women with ovarian cancer who should have been referred according to the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines received a referral for genetic counseling, and of those only 59.5% opted for counseling (although it should be noted that about 95% of women who received counseling subsequently underwent genetic testing) . Significant predictors for referral included . family history, and increasing number of affected family members . Low referral rates have also been reported in the UK . Studies have suggested that this may be partly because of a reluctance among primary care providers to assume responsibility for controlling access to specialized genetic services . ","Inherited genetic mutations are associated with about 15% of ovarian cancers, depending on the histological subtype. Most guidelines recommend that all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer should be referred for genetic counseling and testing, irrespective of their family history. Cascade screening of close blood relatives of individuals found to carry specific genetic mutations can markedly reduce testing costs, because it is only necessary to test for the specific mutation. Referral rates to genetic counseling services are low, despite numerous guideline recommendations, because there are still significant funding issues."
9781908541727,ch07,"Patients will sometimes have no problems with their vision, but will present with concerns about an eye abnormality that they, their family or their optician has seen . Alternatively, you might notice an abnormality in the eyes of an asymptomatic patient . Many abnormalities of eye appearance are minor and of no consequence; however, some abnormalities herald serious disease and require urgent referral, ideally to be seen on the same day . Other patients with abnormal eye appearance may be referred routinely, unless other serious abnormalities are found when taking a history or during your eye examination . Causes according to presentation are as follows . Acute proptosis with pain and a red eye is caused by orbital cellulitis, autoimmune orbital inflammation and carotid-cavernous fistula . Subacute or gradually progressive unilateral or bilateral proptosis with red eye/s is most commonly caused by thyroid eye disease (associated with Graves' disease) . Gradually progressive proptosis of one eye without redness is caused by orbital tumors . Patients complain of pain and sometimes double or blurred vision . It does not cause a true proptosis, but because of the soft tissue swelling it sometimes gives the appearance of proptosis (pseudoproptosis) . If severe, this sometimes results in pulsatile proptosis in which the eye can be seen and/or felt to move forwards in time with the pulse . Thyroid eye disease is the most common cause of proptosis in adults, and usually has a subacute or gradual onset . The eyes' appearance can range from slightly red to very red with severe conjunctival swelling . The course of the eye disease has no relation to the course of the hyperthyroidism (it may occur before, during or after the patient's hyperthyroid period), and treatment of the hyperthyroidism has no effect on the eye disease . Thyroid eye disease is not usually a dangerous eye condition, but it can be very annoying for patients who can suffer . cosmetic embarrassment due to their eye appearance . gritty, watering, irritable eyes . Orbital tumors . Tumors of many kinds may present with proptosis at any age . Orbital tumors may present with a proptosed but otherwise normal-appearing eye or, less commonly, they may mimic orbital cellulitis (acute red eye with proptosis) . Abnormal optic disc/s . Sometimes you will discover an abnormal optic disc on ophthalmoscopy, despite the fact that the patient has not complained of eye problems . Ongoing compression of the optic nerves or chiasm by a tumor is a relatively common cause of optic disc pallor . This disease is usually asymptomatic until advanced, because it causes a slow decrease in peripheral vision long before the patient notices central blurring . Sometimes a patient is noted to have different-sized pupils . The chance of serious disease is low if all of the following are present . the patient is asymptomatic . there is no eye redness, blurred vision, double vision, ptosis, pain or headache . The common causes of unequal pupils are detailed below . Iris disease . The second most common cause of unequal pupil size is previous iritis, trauma or operation . The patient may also have depressed limb tendon reflexes of unknown cause (Holmes-Adie syndrome) . Dilating eye drops are a common cause of abnormal sized pupils . Always try to exclude this before referring the patient . Abnormal red reflex and/or white pupils . Normally, a patient's pupils look black on casual observation . Nystagmus is an uncontrollable, repetitive eye movement that usually affects both eyes . Causes include . poor vision in both eyes from early childhood (due to retinal or optic nerve disease, or congenital cataracts) . congenital or acquired brainstem or cerebellar disease (tumor, stroke, multiple sclerosis, metabolic disease) . middle-ear disease (exempli gratia Ménière's disease) . Abnormal spot on the eye surface . Patients or their relatives occasionally notice a spot on the surface of the eye . Common causes for this include . These patients need urgent referral to an ophthalmologist, as early surgical intervention may save the patient's eye and life . ","Urgently refer patients who present with any of the following signs:- acute red eye with proptosis (forward movement of one or both eyes) (possible orbital cellulitis)- bilateral optic disc swelling (possible papilledema from brain tumor or accelerated hypertension)- unequal pupils plus double vision (possible partial third nerve palsy from posterior communicating artery aneurysm)- an abnormal (dull or white) red reflex and/or white pupil in children (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract). It is very important to perform ophthalmoscopy, looking for optic disc swelling, on all patients who complain of headache; bilateral disc swelling may be the first and only sign of a brain tumor. - acute red eye with proptosis (forward movement of one or both eyes) (possible orbital cellulitis) - bilateral optic disc swelling (possible papilledema from brain tumor or accelerated hypertension) - unequal pupils plus double vision (possible partial third nerve palsy from posterior communicating artery aneurysm) - an abnormal (dull or white) red reflex and/or white pupil in children (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract)."

9781910797815,chp5,"Aims of treatment . The principal complications of polycythemia vera (PV) relate to arterial and venous thrombosis, which are reported to occur in 16-27% and 7-12% of patients, respectively . In addition to the risk of thrombosis, approximately 20% of patients experience hemorrhage and 4-8% experience severe bleeding before or at the time of diagnosis . Because of the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and disease progression, the principal aims of treatment in PV are to reduce the risk of primary or recurrent thrombosis and to control symptoms, but without increasing the risk of hemorrhage or disease transformation . Current treatment options . Current treatment strategies in PV (Table 5.1) focus on reducing the risk of thrombosis by . controlling an elevated hematocrit resulting from excessive red blood cell production . decreasing the risk of thrombosis, using aspirin . controlling erythrocytosis, leukocytosis and/or thrombocytosis with cytoreductive therapy (in selected patients) . Stratification of treatment according to risk . As described in Chapter 3, the risk of thrombosis in patients with PV can be assessed on the basis of multiple factors, including age, history of thrombosis, platelet count and presence of cardiovascular risk factors (Table 3.5) . Accurate risk stratification is essential because the level of risk has a marked impact on survival: patients with the highest risk have a median survival of approximately 11 years, compared with almost 30 years in those at low risk (Figure 5.3) . Phlebotomy to reduce the red cell mass is central to the treatment of PV in all patients . Cytoreductive therapy may be required in such patients and for patients with constitutive symptoms, symptomatic splenomegaly or uncontrolled myeloproliferation . Some patients become intolerant to repeated phlebotomy . All patients with PV should receive low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of thrombosis . Cytoreductive therapy . However, the choice of treatment in an individual patient may also be determined by factors such as the patient's preference, concerns about potential toxicity, intended pregnancy and the availability of IFN-alpha (IFN is not licensed for PV in some countries) . Patients with hydroxyurea-resistant PV may require repeated phlebotomy to maintain the hematocrit below 45% (Figure 5.5) . An increasing need for phlebotomy may therefore indicate inadequate disease control and the need to change treatment . A number of studies have investigated the efficacy of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib in patients with PV . Furthermore, 49% of ruxolitinib-treated patients had a reduction in symptom scores of at least 50%, compared with 5% of placebo recipients . RESPONSE-2 was a randomized open-label study involving 149 patients with phlebotomy-dependent PV without splenomegaly . At 28 weeks, hematocrit control was achieved in 62% of ruxolitinib-treated patients, compared with 19% of patients receiving best available treatment (p < 0.0001) . Similar treatment benefits were seen in patients in whom previous hydroxyurea treatment had been unsuccessful and in patients who had experienced intolerable adverse effects with hydroxyurea . A further study (MAJIC) is currently investigating the efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with high-risk PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea . Managing the risk of transformation to myelofibrosis/blast phase . It seems intuitive that patients with such risk factors should be treated as high risk, although it is currently unclear whether cytoreductive therapy reduces the risk . Patients should be monitored closely and non-leukemogenic treatments used . Criteria for treatment response . The aims of treatment should therefore be to control symptoms, prevent thrombosis and hemorrhage, to minimize the risk of transformation, and to control the hematocrit in all patients with a leukocyte count below 10 x 10 /L and in high-risk patients a platelet count below 400 x 10 /L . Inadequate control of PV can be evident as . frequent or increased need for phlebotomy to control the hematocrit (> 4 per year) . burdensome symptoms . ","The aims of treatment in polycythemia vera (PV) are to reduce the risk of primary or recurrent thrombosis and to control symptoms, but without increasing the risk of hemorrhage or disease transformation. Current treatment strategies focus on reducing the elevated hematocrit resulting from excessive red blood cell production, and aspiring to decrease the risk of thrombosis. Treatment is stratified according to the level of risk. All patients should receive low-dose aspirin and undergo regular phlebotomy to reduce the hematocrit. These measures may be sufficient in low-risk patients whereas those at higher risk may require cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha or other agents. A significant proportion of patients develop resistance to hydroxyurea, necessitating repeated phlebotomy at increasingly shorter intervals to control the hematocrit, indicative of inadequate disease control. The Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib may be useful in patients with hydroxyurea-refractory PV."
9781910797471,ch01,"A complete description of the HF syndrome in every patient should also recognize the following entities . acute versus chronic HF . right versus left (and biventricular) HF . high versus low output HF . Diastolic versus systolic heart failure . heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) when EF is less than 40% . Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved (or normal) ejection fraction . Prevalence increases with age . Heart failure with normal systolic and diastolic function describes a group of patients with symptomatic HF but no evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction on resting echocardiography . In one study, 15% of patients with clinical HF had normal LVEF and normal tests of diastolic function at rest . In addition, some symptomatic patients do not have HF . Acute versus chronic heart failure . An episode of acute HF can be defined as the sudden onset or gradual worsening of signs and symptoms of HF resulting in hospital admission . The typical presentation of acute HF is pulmonary edema . Recognizing the acuity of HF symptoms is an important aspect of managing HF as a chronic disease . Recognizing an exacerbation in a patient with chronic HF should lead to a search for the etiology of this change (see Chapter 3) . Left ventricular HF is the most common type of HF . Either left- or right-sided HF may occur in the context of low output (fatigue, syncope and hypotension) . High versus low output . The most common cause of high-output HF is marked obesity . HF affects an estimated 26 million people worldwide . This shift toward less ischemic heart disease is important for HF management approaches . The enormous impact of HF on individuals and their families is compounded by the huge costs to healthcare budgets around the world . The burden associated with HF is expected to keep rising over the next 20 years due to a number of factors . aging populations in developed countries . an increase in the number of elderly people with CAD and hypertension . Prevalence of HF in developed countries has increased over time; current estimates are shown in Table 1.1 . In those with CAD, a 28% decrease in 5-year mortality after MI was associated with a 25% increase in the 5-year rate of HF . About 70% of patients developed HF within 5 years, with two-thirds of clinical cases in the first year . Incidence of HF also increases with age . While there are some geographic and demographic variations (reflecting differences in the most common etiologies of HF), about half of all incident cases of HF are either systolic or diastolic HF . In 2010, there were over 1 million hospitalizations in the USA with a first-listed discharge diagnosis of HF . The re-hospitalization rate following index admission with HF is high (about 50% at 6 months) . However, about 50% of these readmissions are due to non-HF conditions (exempli gratia respiratory causes) and this rate is even higher in those over 65 years of age . Acute heart failure . While a history of chronic HF can be established in 80% of patients, 20% present with de novo cardiac dysfunction . In the USA, the age-adjusted rate for HF-related deaths decreased between 2000 and 2012, then increased slightly between 2012 and 2014 (see Figure 1.2) . However, as HF results from heterogeneous causes of cardiac damage, mortality rates vary . The worst outcomes have been reported with HF related to HIV infection, cardiac infiltration (amyloid) or cardiac cytotoxicity (due to chemotherapy such as anthracyclines), while the mortality for CAD-related HF (ischemic cardiomyopathy) exceeds that of non-CAD-related HF . Predisposing conditions . CAD, arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease and diabetes mellitus are the four most important predisposing conditions for the development of HF (see Chapter 3) . Over the past 50 years, the prevalence of CAD and diabetes mellitus has increased, while rates of valvular heart disease and hypertension have fallen . Population attributable risk estimates the proportion of HF in the population that is attributable to each predisposing condition . Additive risk . The presence of two or more predisposing conditions in the same individual increases the risk of developing HF . ","Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is characterized by an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 40%. The European Society of Cardiology has defined a new category of heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), characterized by an EF of 40-49%. Left ventricular HF is the most common type of HF. Symptomatic HF affects 2-3% of the global population. The financial burden associated with HF is likely to rise over the next 20 years. Coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease and diabetes mellitus are the four most important predisposing conditions for the development of HF."
9781910797273,chp5,"What is the benefit of treatment? . In general, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are used in ambulatory patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) . There is less evidence of benefit in patients with progressive forms of the disease but this is rapidly changing . In patients with relapsing disease, existing therapies reduce the rate of relapse and slow the rate of lesion accumulation on MRI, but neither of these endpoints has a clear correlation with disability . It is important to consider this when initiating treatment, and to be realistic about what each treatment can offer . When to start disease-modifying treatment . An initial consideration in the management of MS is when to start treatment and which treatment to choose . Patients with active relapsing disease (usually defined as two relapses in a 2-year period) should be offered treatment, and an increasing body of evidence suggests that early therapy has advantages over delayed treatment (Figure 5.1) . Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who are at greater risk of developing MS (see Chapter 3) may benefit from early initiation of first-line therapies . Injectable therapy . Both treatments have been shown, in multiple clinical trials, to reduce relapse rates by 33-38% over a 2-year period, and in most countries are licensed for the treatment of patients with relapsing MS who have experienced two or more clinically significant relapses over the last 2 years . Early initiation of treatment . In patients with the first relapse, there is evidence that these treatments delay the second clinical attack which can be the defining event to confirm MS . Injection issues . The mode and frequency of therapy may affect the treatment decision . Rarely, patients have 'needle phobia' and will not contemplate injectable therapy . Significant flu-like symptoms are experienced by approximately 50% of patients commencing IFNbeta therapy . After 2 years of treatment, up to 35% of patients taking interferon therapy produce neutralizing antibodies against the drug . These can reduce the efficacy of the treatment and are an indication to consider alternative treatment options . Oral therapies . Side effects . Dimethyl fumarate, 240 mg twice daily, is an effective oral therapy that has shown promise as both a first-line treatment and escalation treatment for MS . Side effects . Guidelines recommend performing FBC before starting treatment and at 3-monthly intervals for the first year . Long-term safety data in patients with MS are lacking . Fingolimod was the first oral agent to be licensed for relapsing forms of MS . In the USA and Australia it is used as first-line therapy; globally, it is considered a second-line treatment for people whose MS remains active despite treatment with injectable or other oral DMTs . Side effects . Intravenous therapies . Initially licensed in the USA in 2004, it was the first therapy of this type for MS and seen as a breakthrough in treatment . Side effects . However, alemtuzumab does not appear to reduce gradual deterioration in patients with secondary progressive disease . Side effects . Immunosuppressive therapy . Mitoxantrone, at a cumulative lifetime dose of less than 140 mg, effectively reduces relapses and has shown modest efficacy in reducing progressive disability in patients with secondary progressive MS . Mitoxantrone has largely been supplanted by natalizumab in patients with highly active relapsing MS despite conventional DMT . When to stop or escalate disease-modifying treatment . The indications for ceasing or escalating treatment are shown in Table 5.4 . Treatment escalation strategy . For patients with mild to moderate disease, a treatment escalation strategy has been advocated, starting with first-line injectable or oral DMTs . In patients with severe, or 'highly active' MS, natalizumab or alemtuzumab may be an appropriate choice, particularly when other therapies have failed . The treatment escalation paradigm is clearly not applicable in all patients with relapsing MS, in particular those presenting with rapidly evolving disease . Considerations other than efficacy and safety, for instance a strong patient preference for oral therapy, may also dictate treatment choice in relapsing MS . Immune-directed therapies have little or no effect in the later progressive phase of the disease, which remains a major unmet treatment need . ","Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) ameliorate CNS inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), effectively reducing the relapse rate and the accumulation of new brain lesions identified on MRI. Early introduction of DMT, even at the clinically isolated syndrome stage, may be advantageous. Conversely, immune-directed DMT is not effective in patients with established secondary progressive MS. DMTs can be given in injectable, oral or intravenous form. Newer DMTs, such as natalizumab, alemtuzumab and fingolimod, are significantly more effective than injectable agents, but carry modest risks that must be considered when making treatment choices in individual patients. A treatment escalation strategy is appropriate for most patients with mild to moderate disease. Clinical and radiological parameters should be carefully monitored for evidence of disease activity in this paradigm. Induction therapy for MS is a new concept, using one of the 'stronger' MS medications, to 'reset' the disease course. Early institution of efficacious newer-generation therapies should be strongly considered in patients with rapidly evolving MS. Cytotoxic immunosuppression and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are reserved for patients with MS that is refractory to available DMT."
9781910797297,chp1,"Nevertheless, controversy still exists with respect to the classification, biology and behavior of these neoplasms . WHO classification by type . The term cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) encompasses a wide range of disorders . The atypical cells in CTCL are usually CD4+ T cells, but may be CD8+; the latter is more common in children but is also seen in some adults . When the malignant cells are CD8+, the clinical presentation may be of hypopigmented patches rather than scaly red patches . In 2005 and 2008, an extensive classification of CTCL was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) . Classification by clinical behavior . Clinicopathological correlation is crucial to the correct diagnosis of CTCL . However, the cytomorphology of T cells often does not correlate with the clinical behavior of the lymphoma, except in rare instances . The most common CTCLs are discussed below, and the pathology is reviewed in more detail in Chapters 3 and . Indolent CTCLs generally have a good prognosis and prolonged course, and often lack systemic symptoms . A number of these patients will progress to advanced/aggressive disease (around 25% of patients with MF) with a higher risk of secondary malignancies, particularly in those with LyP who may develop a systemic lymphoma . As such, all patients with indolent CTCL should be followed up closely for development of lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss or night sweats suggestive of systemic lymphoma or another cancer type . Although it tends to have an indolent course, the disease does progress in some patients, who have an aggressive projection with fevers, hepatosplenomegaly and systemic involvement . Aggressive CTCLs often progress rapidly with extracutaneous involvement, have a poor prognosis and are associated with systemic symptoms . These CTCLs warrant systemic treatment and generally display a cytotoxic immunophenotype . CTCLs are relatively rare diseases, with an annual age-adjusted incidence of 6.4 per million persons in the USA and similar worldwide . In the USA, the incidence of MF and non-MF has been reported to be 4.5 and 4.0 per million persons, respectively . One study reported a general increase in incidence of 2.9 x 10 -6 per decade between 1973 and 2002, while another reported a relatively stable incidence between 1998 and 2009 . African-American patients present with CTCL at a younger age than white patients (mean age of 51.5 vs 59.2 years) . While the incidence of CTCL rises sharply with age, it also occurs in pediatric and young adult populations . The overall incidence of both MF and non-MF CTCL is higher in men than women (Figure 1.2a), with a ratio of 2.2 to 1 . African-Americans have a higher incidence of both MF and non-MF than whites, Asian/Pacific islanders and Native Americans (Figure 1.2b) . Furthermore, African-Americans and hispanics have a statistically significant greater incidence of presenting at a more advanced stage of both MF and non-MF . Mortality from MF is 0.0064 per 100 000 person-years and is higher in men than women . Advanced age and black race are associated with poorer survival . Overall, 5-year survival rates for patients with CTCL are high (85%), ranging from 91% for patients with MF to 40% for patients with SS . Little is known of the etiology of MF . Epidemiological studies have found an increased incidence of secondary internal malignancies in patients with CTCL, particularly lung carcinoma, colonic adenocarcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which do not appear to be related to therapy . MF is also associated with other lymphomas of both T-cell (LyP, nodal CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma) and B-cell (Hodgkin's disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) origins . Furthermore, in some patients with a secondary T-cell neoplasm, the same T-cell clone has been identified in both lymphomas, indicating that they are derived from the same neoplastic clone . There does not appear to be a familial link in CTCL; however, there are reports of an increase in lymphoma in first-degree relatives of patients with CTCL . ","Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) account for approximately 65% of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs); lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) make-up 25%, and the remaining 10% are rare diseases. Clinicopathological correlation is crucial in the diagnosis of CTCLs, as the histological findings do not always correspond with the clinical behavior, and many benign dermatoses can mimic the histopathology of MF and other CTCLs. CTCL is generally subdivided into neoplasms with indolent and those with aggressive clinical behavior. Indolent forms have a good prognosis and prolonged course, and often lack systemic symptoms. They are usually treated with skin-directed therapies. Aggressive forms have a poor prognosis, and are associated with systemic symptoms that warrant systemic treatment. They generally display a cytotoxic immunophenotype. CTCL is a relatively rare group of diseases with an estimated incidence of 6.4 per million persons. Onset most often occurs around the sixth decade of life in white people, with earlier onset in African-Americans. African-Americans have statistically significant higher incidence of both MF and non-MF CTCL, and often present with more advanced disease. Patients with CTCL have an increased risk of secondary malignancies. No familial link in CTCL has been identified."

This chapter considers primary glomerulonephritis; secondary glomerulonephritis is discussed in the context of systemic disease in Chapter 7 . Glomerulonephritis presents in a limited number of ways, depending on the nature and severity of the glomerular injury . Mild disease can present with asymptomatic hematuria and/or proteinuria . Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis describes a rapid loss of kidney function, such that the patient will be in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within weeks or months . Hypertension may also be the presenting feature of some forms of glomerulonephritis . Except in the mildest cases, or in nephrotic syndrome in children, the suspicion of glomerulonephritis should lead to kidney biopsy . Minimal change disease . Immunofluorescence is generally negative . Other immunoglobulins and complement components may also be present . Focal and segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis is generally secondary to systemic disease (see Chapter 7) . Minimal change disease accounts for most cases of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 20% of cases in adults . It is associated with atopy in children and may be related to underlying Hodgkin's disease in adults . Relapsing disease may go into remission following treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide . Although severe nephrotic syndrome has its own complications (exempli gratia thrombotic episodes, infection), minimal change disease does not progress to ESKD . Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in older children and younger adults; it may be associated with hematuria . About 50% of patients may respond to a course of high-dose prednisolone, although treatment for up to 4 months is often required in adults . Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis often progresses to ESKD over several years, but progression may be curtailed by treatment with corticosteroids . Antiretroviral therapy may be effective, and some patients respond to additional corticosteroids . Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in older adults . Hematuria is rare . Membranous nephropathy progresses to ESKD in 30-50% of patients . Secondary forms of the disease are associated with hepatitis C with or without cryoglobulins, other chronic infections and SLE . Despite the lack of evidence from controlled studies, nephrotic patients with primary MCGN are often treated with corticosteroids . Immunoglobulin A nephropathy is the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide . It often presents with macroscopic hematuria, which may be precipitated within a few days by an upper respiratory tract infection . It is also detected as asymptomatic hematuria and/or albuminuria, and can present with nephrotic syndrome . In patients with deteriorating kidney function, the addition of immunosuppressive drugs has been proposed . Although progression is slow, 20-30% of patients may eventually develop ESKD . Classically, the disease is caused by streptococcal infection, either of the pharynx or the skin . Many other bacterial and viral causes have now been described . Almost all children will recover without treatment (other than antibiotics for the infection), but a small proportion of adults may develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) . It presents with the clinical syndrome of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis . Without treatment, the disease progresses to ESKD within a few weeks or months, but prednisolone and cyclophosphamide are generally effective in patients before severe kidney damage occurs . The addition of plasma exchange or pulse doses of methylprednisolone is recommended in patients with advanced renal disease . The syndrome presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, usually leading to kidney failure within 6 months if untreated . However, patients will seldom recover kidney function once they start dialysis . It is extremely rare for patients to relapse, and the long-term outcome is good following successful treatment . ",Glomerulonephritis should be considered in all patients with urine abnormalities. Urgent investigations are needed to determine the precise type. Treatments are available for most categories of glomerulonephritis. Crescentic glomerulonephritis requires urgent and aggressive immunosuppression.
9781912776153,chp9,"Risk of developing AF . AF costs approximately 1% of the healthcare budget in the UK and France . Lone AF (AF in the absence of cardiovascular disease) is more common in younger patients (younger than 60 years) . The causes of AF are shown in Table 9.1 . This type of paroxysmal AF is occasionally termed focal AF . An increase in the amount of fibrosis within the atria appears to increase the risk of developing AF . Moderate-to-severe left atrial dilatation is also associated with an increased risk of AF . Once AF is sustained, the atria gradually dilate and fibrosis increases . AF is not a benign condition . Evidence that AF itself increases the risk of stroke is overwhelming: one-sixth of strokes occur in patients with AF . Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may also not tolerate AF . Many studies have shown impaired QoL in patients with AF . A highly systematic approach to assessment of AF is required . detect AF and confirm diagnosis . identify the duration and type of AF . assess symptom severity . assess stroke risk . assess risk of bleeding before anticoagulation . Detect AF . If AF is suspected, an ECG should be performed immediately . Identify the duration and type of AF . Assess symptom severity . Assess stroke risk . AF is a major cause of embolic stroke . A Holter monitor is useful to determine the average ventricular rate during AF, which helps to assess the effectiveness of drug therapy . Many patients with symptomatic AF also have asymptomatic AF, and a Holter monitor provides an appreciation of AF burden . Treatment will depend upon where and how the patient presents . The decision to pursue rhythm control must be tailored to the individual patient . It is increasingly recognized that a number of modifiable factors are associated with an increased risk of AF . More importantly many factors are modifiable and reduce the risk of AF . A common question is the effect of caffeine on the frequency of AF . Rhythm control versus rate control . A variety of factors will determine the preferred treatment approach in each individual patient . Most patients have paroxysmal AF, a first-documented episode of AF or an unknown pattern of AF at the time of treatment . A large proportion of patients with recent-onset AF experience spontaneous cardioversion within 24-48 hours . This is less likely to occur when AF has persisted for more than 7 days . Asymptomatic AF in patients older than 75 years (id est discovered on routine examination) requires discussion with the patient about whether a rate control or rhythm control strategy should be considered . Maintenance of sinus rhythm with drugs is relevant in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF . Drug therapy for ventricular rate control . As patients with paroxysmal AF may develop persistent AF, there has been concern that dronedarone may continue to be used in all patients with AF regardless of type . Digoxin is now infrequently used in the management of AF . It is not useful for controlling the ventricular rate during exertion . If the patient has new symptoms of syncope, the drug should be stopped immediately . Exercise-induced AF . Lone AF and vagally mediated AF . Adrenergically mediated AF . Digoxin is also not effective at rate control during exercise . Monitoring of drug treatment varies with the agent involved and with patient factors . Clinical state and LV function should be reassessed in selected patients, especially if clinical heart failure develops during treatment of AF . Pacemakers may be particularly useful for elderly patients who may have sinus node dysfunction associated with AF . 'Ablate and pace' for ventricular rate control . Patients with symptomatic AF undergoing open heart surgery for other reasons are potential candidates for AF ablation . Elderly patients with AF form a special group . Anticoagulation regimens for different patient groups are outlined in Table 9.11 . DOACs are gradually replacing warfarin in the majority of patients with AF . Use of the new anticoagulants in patients undergoing surgery requires close monitoring . Anticoagulation should be given when AF has been present for 48 hours or more . ","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is very common and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is vital to determine whether AF is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent or permanent because the treatment aims are different for each patient group. Stroke risk and major bleeding risk in AF are multifactorial and can be assessed by the CHADS /CHA DS -VASc and HAS-BLED scores, respectively. The direct oral anticoagulants are gradually replacing warfarin as first-line anticoagulant treatment for AF. Radiofrequency ablation is now the preferred option for many patients with AF. AF ablation is still evolving as an interventional procedure, with the arrival of new mapping software and the continual evaluation of ablation methods and techniques. In most patients, AF is not cured by ablation. In many patients, AF is a progressive condition that may be associated with long-term recurrences of AF after apparently successful ablation procedures."
9781910797273,chp1,"The cause of MS is unknown, but dysregulation of the immune system is central to the pathogenesis of the disease . MS is the leading cause of neurological disability in the young and middle-aged populations of the developed world . The number of people with MS in a given population at any one time is usually expressed as cases per 100 000 population . MS is most prevalent in northern European Caucasian populations, especially individuals of Nordic descent, and is notably more prevalent in temperate than equatorial regions . The worldwide prevalence of MS appears to be increasing: this is related to many factors, including earlier diagnosis, an aging population and a true increase in disease incidence, especially in females . Globally, the median estimated prevalence of MS is 33 per 100 000 . Regionally, the median estimated prevalence of MS is greatest in North America and Europe (140 and 108 per 100 000, respectively) . Prevalence varies significantly both within regions and within countries . The number of new cases per 100 000 population per year can indicate changes in the risk of a disease within a population, and can signify whether the disease frequency is increasing in a population . The median estimated global incidence of MS is 2.5 per 100 000 per year, but in some countries the incidence may exceed 10 per 100 000 per year . Geo-epidemiology of MS . The prevalence of MS is significantly associated with latitude, particularly in populations of European descent (Figure 1.1) . MS is more common in women than men, at a ratio of 2-3:1 . In Denmark, where an MS registry has been ongoing since 1948, there appears to be an increase in the incidence of MS in women, with a stable rate in the male population . The pediatric MS population has a prepubertal sex ratio of 1:1, pointing to a likely association between sex hormones and disease onset . The latitudinal prevalence gradient for MS may be explained in part by a relationship to exposure to UV radiation from sunlight, as there is an association between low levels of UVB exposure and development of MS . There is an association between low levels of vitamin D and a number of diseases, including MS . Populations exposed to limited sunlight but who consume diets rich in fatty fish, a good source of vitamin D, have lower MS prevalence rates than expected for their latitude . Prospective studies have shown that MS risk is lower in groups who take vitamin D supplements regularly . Higher vitamin D levels are associated with lower risk of relapse and slower rates of progression in MS . Individuals with MS are rarely seronegative for EBV, and there is a strong association between previous history of infectious mononucleosis and MS, with a twofold greater risk of MS in this group . There also appears to be a relationship between the titers of EBV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the risk of MS . The risk of MS is higher in 'ever smokers' than 'never smokers' and there is a direct link between duration and intensity of smoking . Cultural trends that have led to an increase in the number of female smokers may be contributing to the rising incidence of MS in females . The risk of developing secondary progressive MS is higher in 'ever smokers' than 'never smokers' . Migration studies support a relationship between the country of origin and risk of MS . An individual's age at the time of migration from a high prevalence area to one of low prevalence appears to affect the risk for MS, with a critical time period that may extend into early adulthood . Although this observation lends indirect support to the hypothesis that environmental factors contribute to MS risk, the correlation between migration and MS risk is not necessarily maintained when people from communities that do not classically have a high MS prevalence, such as the Japanese, move to areas of high prevalence . No single causative gene for MS has been identified . However, there is greater risk of developing MS for people with a family member with this diagnosis (Table 1.1) . In Caucasians, HLA-DRB1*1501 has been consistently associated with MS . Most of the risk alleles associated with MS are related to function of the immune system . MS is more common in people with northern European ancestry . People living in the same environment with different ethnicities have different prevalence rates for MS . The wider range of ethnicity and higher number of first-generation immigrants seen among those with pediatric-onset MS suggests a change in the risk pattern in this subset of MS, and highlights the genetic contribution to MS susceptibility . ","At least 2.3 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is more common in women than men (2-3:1), and the incidence of MS in females is rising. The prevalence of MS is increasing worldwide, with a greater prevalence in populations of northern European descent. There is a 'latitudinal gradient' of MS, that is, a higher prevalence and incidence of MS in areas of higher latitude (remote from the equator). There is an association between low levels of vitamin D and prevalence (and possibly severity) of MS. Most people with MS have been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). People who have had infectious mononucleosis have a twofold higher risk of developing MS. The rate of MS is higher in smokers and in those with exposure to passive smoking than in those who have never smoked. MS has a heritable component, but the condition is not related to a single gene (multiple gene interactions are likely to be involved); the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele DRB1*1501 has a strong association with MS in Caucasians."

Immediate urgent referral of patients with serious eye trauma can save sight in the injured eye/s (see opposite) . foreign body under the upper lid . corneal abrasion with no sign of penetrating eye injury or infection . Serious eye injuries . A patient suspected of having any of these injuries requires urgent referral . Penetrating eye injury . Even if the eye looks normal on examination, you must refer the patient urgently to an ophthalmologist because of the risk of intraocular infection or retinal toxicity to a metallic intraocular foreign body . Ocular structures are often damaged at the time, but there is also a high risk of intraocular infection that can cause blindness and loss of the eye within days . Injuries range from the eye being struck with the sharp tip of a palm frond while gardening, which may result in an eye with normal vision that has a barely visible corneal laceration, to a patient whose eye has been severely lacerated with broken glass . eye pain, photophobia (sensitivity to light), blurred vision, floaters or field loss after a suspicious-sounding injury . Telephone an ophthalmologist immediately if you suspect your patient has a penetrating eye injury . Intraocular foreign body is most commonly caused by a small piece of high-speed metal striking the eye, often in metalworkers whilst hammering . An urgent slit-lamp examination and X-ray of the orbit should be carried out in any patient who says they have been hit in the eye with a high-speed fragment . Hyphema may be seen after blunt trauma that has caused no other damage to the eye, or it may be a sign of penetrating eye injury, intraocular foreign body or ruptured globe . Permanent corneal blood staining can also occur with high eye pressure . This injury should be suspected in any patient with blunt facial trauma who admits to double vision or a numb cheek or numb upper teeth on the side of the injury . Chemical burn by acid, alkali (strong alkalis in particular) or other substances such as snake venom may cause devastating damage to the eye . Alkali disrupts cell membranes allowing ease of penetration of the alkali into the eye . Acid and alkali burns can, however, often result in blindness or loss of the eye . Method of eye irrigation . If one eye is affected, it helps to position the patient on a bed and turn the patient's head so that the affected eye is pointing toward the pillow . This will prevent the substance being washed over the fellow normal eye and/or facial skin .

Abrasions are frequently caused by scratches or minor blunt trauma to the eye, and often cause intense pain and foreign body sensation . You will need to review and re-pad the eye daily until it has healed . Subconjunctival hemorrhage looks startling, but is not serious unless there are other underlying injuries (such as a penetrating eye injury) . No treatment is needed if no other injuries are present, but it is worth checking the patient's blood pressure . It is essential that you measure VA in every patient with a 'black eye', and carry out as full an eye examination as is possible .

9781912776207,ch1,"The immune system combats foreign pathogens through innate and acquired (or adaptive) immunity (Figure 1.1) . It comprises the physical epithelial barrier, complement activation, some T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and phagocytic cells (neutrophils and macrophages) which engulf and remove pathogens . In the adaptive immune system, T and B cells recognize and respond to specific antigens, producing a tailored response to invading pathogens . Persistence of these 'experienced' T and B cells results in long-term immune memory . T cells develop from progenitors within the thymus gland . Mature T cells can be broadly classified into two types . cytotoxic T cells, which kill cells infected with microorganisms . T-cell receptors (TCRs) are analogous to the immunoglobulin molecules in B cells . Early T cells express TCRs in germline configuration . Recombination of TCR genes during maturation of T cells produces a unique TCR configuration - a critical feature of protective immunity that enables mature T cells to recognize and respond to a broad range of foreign material . These alphabeta T cells recognize and bind foreign peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells . This MHC-antigen complex binds to alphabeta TCRs, while other co-stimulatory molecules (exempli gratia CD28) are activated, leading to alphabeta T-cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and cytokine release . About 5% of T cells express a gamma and delta TCR (gammaδ T cells) . These cells have similarities with NK cells, with roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses . As a first line of defense after antigenic stimulus, gammaδ T cells release cytotoxic factors (perforins, granzyme B and TIA-1) . CD4 and CD8 . Lymphoid progenitor cells in the thymus undergo stepwise maturation (Figure 1.2) . The developing cells, called thymocytes, do not initially express CD4 or CD8 (described as double negative); expression of CD4 and CD8 is driven by positive signals received during development, resulting in double-positive thymocytes . Double-positive cells also encounter self-antigens and those that exhibit self-reactivity undergo negative selection . Finally, either CD4 or CD8 is downregulated, resulting in single-positive cells . The naive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells enter the peripheral circulation from the thymus . CD8 + T cells recognize antigens presented by the MHC class I molecules found on nucleated cells . Once activated, the CD8 + T cells proliferate to produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes - a population of effector T cells which release the enzymes and toxins that induce apoptosis . CD4 + T cells recognize antigens presented by MHC class II molecules, which are only present on specialized antigen-presenting cells . Most of these cells are 'helper' subsets, which release cytokines, sending positive signals to other immune cells, predominantly B cells (Figure 1.3) . A unique subset of CD4+ T cells, called T regulatory cells, restrain the immune response via various cytokine and signaling mechanisms, preventing aberrant or exaggerated immune activation . Follicular helper T cells provide essential support for B-cell immune responses . Our understanding of T-cell subsets has advanced significantly over recent years . The external signals (cytokines) that trigger polarized T-cell differentiation are being elucidated, as are the molecular mechanisms that alter T-cell behavior to produce specific effector functions . Furthermore, gene expression profiling is being used to define the molecular signatures of T-cell subsets . These insights are refining our understanding of PTCL subtypes and have allowed the cell of origin to be identified for some (see Chapter 2) . Natural killer cells . NK cells are a type of lymphocyte derived from the same common lymphoid progenitor as B and T lymphocytes but develop primarily in the bone marrow . NK cells are typically considered part of the innate immune system because they rapidly produce inflammatory cytokines and directly kill infected cells without prior priming or activation . However, recent evidence suggests that NK cells are also important in adaptive immunity . ","T cells develop in the thymus and are part of the innate and adaptive immune system. They recognize and respond to specific antigens, producing a tailored response to invading pathogens. Mature T cells express a surface T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes fragments of antigen as peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.

9781912776238,ch10,"For originator drugs, the pivotal trial endpoints were disease-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates 5 years after treatment . Critically, the pharmacodynamic endpoints for biosimilars are usually surrogate rather than clinical results . The indications for rituximab are summarized in Table 10.1 . This is complicated further by the lack of uniformity between the biosimilar developers for the clinical confirmatory trials . The inclusion and exclusion criteria differ . Furthermore, patients often relapse following a complete clinical response to initial treatment . Three of those trials also show OS benefit of 6-13% at 4 years . For this consideration, formulary committees will have to balance the risks of off-label schedules with the clinical evidence that support them . Its indications are shown in Table 10.3 . It has two principal modes of action that are important to consider when reviewing the clinical confirmatory trials of biosimilars . To further increase complexity, trastuzumab is associated with cardiac toxicity . Confirmatory clinical trials . With multiple modes of action and of toxicity, assays of potency and predictors of toxicity need to be correlated with confirmatory clinical trials before trastuzumab biosimilars can be approved . It can be frustrating for clinicians that two very different models for demonstrating clinical comparability were used for trastuzumab . In the case of cardiac toxicity from trastuzumab, with no consensus on the probable mechanism of toxicity, the confirmatory clinical trials had to be powered to provide a clinical endpoint . The reasons for such a result would include chance from unbalanced randomization, true superiority of the biosimilar or inferiority of the reference trastuzumab . In both cases, the biosimilar developers demonstrated a change in the analytic potency characteristics of the reference trastuzumab linked with a manufacturing change that altered the drug fucosylation levels; claiming this as a likely explanation for its inferior clinical performance in the trial . This European decision to endorse two biosimilars when clinical studies do not show statistical equivalence may appear contradictory to biosimilar regulation that mandates clinical confirmatory studies as an essential step to approval . Proponents of this approach, placing analytics and pharmacology ahead of clinical studies, point out that for decades analytic comparability has reduced the need for clinical studies after manufacturing changes . The situation for trastuzumab, to June 2019, is summarized in Table 10.7 . Neoadjuvant or metastatic trial settings for trastuzumab biosimilars . Scientifically, we should choose the most sensitive of the labeled other indications to detect difference and extrapolate that data to other indications . For trastuzumab, we have a choice of two labeled indications that can report primary endpoints in trial follow-up of 12 months or less (Table 10.8) . had a median of 7.4 months for time to disease progression for trastuzumab and chemotherapy . On balance, there is no clear winning trial design . Subcutaneous trastuzumab and shorter trastuzumab schedules . By sparing infusion facilities, it has a significant time impact for hospitals and clinics during the monotherapy phase of trastuzumab treatment . Biosimilars are permitted to have differences compared with the original reference medicine, but only as long as these are predicted to deliver no clinically meaningful differences in practice . For biosimilars of bevacizumab, we can gain insight into the approaches of the developer and regulator over such an analytic difference from data reviewed by the ODAC in July 2017 . Such issues cannot be assessed by the drug regulators as use in wet ARMD is unlicensed . Confirmatory clinical trial design . There is a problem for clinical confirmatory studies with bevacizumab . Designing confirmatory trials is also a problem, as the most useful indication is one with the greatest difference in pharmacodynamic endpoints for the reference drug . As bevacizumab was the first approved anti-VEGF agent, it was used off-label for ARMD treatment and proved successful . Off-label drug use needs to be considered on an individual basis, judging whether the evidence of benefit outweighs the risks for that patient . There is not only the individual risk and benefit to patients to be considered in choosing bevacizumab brands . With biosimilars, there is a new problem of extrapolation . ","Biologics used in oncology settings have, as their trial endpoints, survival rates at 5 years. Confirmatory clinical trials for biosimilars tend to use disease response as an endpoint. This can be potentially problematic when the association between response and survival is weak, as with, for example, bevacizumab in bowel and gynecologic cancers. Formulary decisions for long-duration drug tenders need to be forward thinking; if shorter-schedule treatments are adopted, might this impact on the relative merits of the biosimilar formulations approved? Lack of a uniform approach to the design of clinical confirmatory trials, including differences in statistical design, disease and disease stage and participant characteristics, make it very difficult for clinicians to compare biosimilars. Extension of patent protection, as occurs when a new indication is gained, can impede biosimilar developers from gaining an 'interchangeable' designation."
9781910797556,chp3,"Clinical presentation . Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness (Table 3.1) . As with any disorder of neuromuscular transmission, the distinctive clinical feature of MG is the fluctuating nature of weakness that patients report - a phenomenon known as 'fatigability' . Symptoms of MG tend to worsen with concurrent illness, over-exertion of the muscle (exempli gratia fatigue from speaking or eating), the use of certain medications, and as the day progresses . The presentation of MG in any given patient is variable; not all patients will experience all of the symptoms described below . Ocular symptoms . Approximately two-thirds of patients initially present with ocular symptoms . Generalized symptoms . The disease spreads beyond the eye muscle in over 80% of patients, with a predilection for bulbar, facial, neck and proximal limb muscle involvement . Dysarthria or dysphonia may manifest after the patient speaks for a prolonged period of time . Myasthenic crisis . Roughly 15% of patients with MG will experience myasthenic crisis, defined as respiratory failure due to MG, most likely within the the first 2 years following symptom onset . In most instances, the clinician can be confident about the diagnosis of MG based on a characteristic history and physical examination . However, one or more tests are routinely performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis . Antibody testing . Testing for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies is always performed in patients suspected of having MG . AChR-antibody-negative patients with predominant bulbar involvement are often tested for muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies . It is worth noting that, while increased jitter on single fiber electromyography is very sensitive in patients with MG, it is not specific for the disease, therefore other causes of weakness should be ruled out . In addition, a decremental response on repetitive nerve stimuation may disappear in patients with MG in a muscle that is no longer clinically weak . In other words, lack of decrement in a muscle that is reported to be weak may indicate a cause other than MG . Edrophonium test . A positive edrophonium test ('Tensilon test') can also be used to confirm the diagnosis . Conventional management . The treatment of MG should be individualized according to the patient's disease severity and its effect on daily living and quality of life, comorbid medical conditions and personal preferences . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been used in the treatment of MG since 1934 when Walker successfully treated a patient with physostigmine for generalized disease . These agents are often the initial therapeutic intervention in MG . Unfortunately, most patients with MG cannot be controlled on anticholinesterase medications alone and require treatment with either thymectomy or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy (Figure 3.3) . Corticosteroids were the first immunosuppressant drugs to be widely used in the treatment of MG . They produce significant clinical improvement in the vast majority of patients . The mean response to maximum benefit with corticosteroids is 5-6 months, with most patients going into remission or being left with only mild symptoms . Although corticosteroids are effective, the myriad potential side effects of chronic corticosteroid treatment necessitates the use of other immunosuppressant agents in many patients with MG . A trial of one of these drugs is recommended in patients who are unable to tolerate the dose of corticosteroid required to control their symptoms or who relapse during a steroid taper . Intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) and plasmapheresis are often used in patients with MG to reduce perioperative morbidity before surgery, inducing rapid improvement in patients with severe disease or in crisis . It is also used for chronic management in selected refractory patients . Thymectomy has been regularly performed for MG in patients with and without thymoma since 1939 . Although it is known to be of benefit in MG, it was not until 2016 that a randomized trial demonstrated clear benefit of thymectomy in non-thymomatous MG . Thymectomy is of greatest benefit in patients younger than 40 years of age, but maximal benefit may not be seen until 3 years after surgery . Management of refractory patients . ","Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. It can affect the ocular, bulbar, facial, neck, respiratory and limb muscles. The symptoms of MG may be exacerbated by concurrent illness, over-exertion of the muscle, the use of certain medications, and as the day progresses. All patients suspected of having MG should be tested for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies. If these antibodies are present, no further diagnostic testing is usually required other than the use of imaging to determine if a thymoma is present. AChR-antibody-negative patients with predominant bulbar involvement are often tested for muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies and, where available, antibodies to clustered AChR. (It should be noted, however, that clustered AChR antibody testing is available only at a few specialist centers, and is not routinely performed in general laboratories.) Patients who are antibody negative should be tested for a decrementing response on repetitive nerve stimulation, elevated jitter values on single fiber electromyography or a positive edrophonium test. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are often the initial therapeutic intervention in patients with MG. Most patients with MG require additional treatment with either thymectomy or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy. Consideration of additional therapeutic options is warranted for patients who are identified as being refractory to conventional treatment."
9781910797815,chp1,"Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is characterized by an increased platelet count, associated with megakaryocytic hyperplasia . The genetic basis of these MPNs has been elucidated over the last two decades but emerging evidence suggests that non-genetic factors such as age and inflammation also play important roles in their development and progression . Genetic basis . Driver mutations . The MPNs are caused by driver mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) or calreticulin (CALR) genes (Table 1.1) . JAK2 and CALR mutations are most commonly involved, although the distribution of driver mutations differs in ET, PV and PMF (Figure 1.1) . In general, these mutations are mutually exclusive (exempli gratia the presence of a JAK2 mutation largely precludes MPL or CALR mutations) and predominantly present only in MPNs (described as MPN restricted) . Non-restricted mutations found in other myeloid disorders are also found in MPNs, such as mutations of ASXL1 . JAK2 mutations . The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in approximately 70% of MPNs, but 95% of cases of PV . A small proportion of individuals with PV have mutations in JAK2 exon 12, particularly those who do not have the JAK2 V617F mutation . Although these JAK2 mutations are not usually associated with PMF, they can lead to the development of post-PV myelofibrosis . JAK2 mutation-negative PV can occur but is rare . The MPL gene encodes the thrombopoietin receptor . These mutations are present in only 3-5% of individuals with ET or PMF . A further mutation, MPL S505N, is present in fewer than 1% of ET cases . Type 1 mutations are most common . It is a heterogeneous condition: some cases may be hereditary thrombocytosis, some have rarer mutations in JAK2, MPL or non-driver genes and some patients have no detectable mutations . Non-driver mutations have also been implicated in the initiation and progression of MPNs . These include mutations affecting . The involvement of these genes in disease initiation and progression is summarized in Table 1.2 . Although most of these mutations are uncommon, some may be present in up to 25% of PMF cases . A variety of mutations may be involved, the most common of which are in DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53 (which encodes p53), JAK2 and SF3B1 . The prevalence of CHIP increases with age, reaching approximately 10% among individuals aged 70-80 years . The greatest increase in risk is seen in carriers of the DNMT3A and TET2 mutations . Inflammation appears to play a key role in the development of PMF, and the other MPNs to a lesser extent . Inflammatory cytokines are secreted by hematopoietic cells (with and without mutations) and by non-hematopoietic cells such as mesenchymal stem cells, and appear to create a favorable environment for the expression of JAK2 V617F . Environmental factors, notably age and genetic predisposition, appear to influence the initiation of MPNs . The prevalence of the JAK2 V617F mutation increases with age, underlying the increasing prevalence of both CHIP and overt MPNs . In a recent study, the overall prevalence of this mutation in the general population was 0.2%, the median age of JAK2 V617F carriers was 68 years, and the prevalence of the mutation increased from 0.03% at age 21-30 years to 1.1% at age 81-90 years . In particular, increasing age is associated with deregulation of hematopoietic stem cells, which may provide an environment that favors JAK2 V617F expression . A number of genetic variants appear to confer a predisposition to the development of MPN . genes affecting JAK2/STAT signaling (exempli gratia JAK2 46/1 haplotype, SH2B3) . genes involved in DNA damage repair (exempli gratia CYHEK2, TERT) . non-coding RNA genes (exempli gratia PINT) . ","Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are usually caused by driver mutations in the JAK2, MPL and CALR genes. The most common JAK2 mutation is V617F, which activates downstream signaling via erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and thrombopoietin receptors. This mutation is associated with all three MPNs, whereas MPL and CALR mutations activate mainly the thrombopoietin receptor and hence are only associated with ET and PMF. Numerous other somatic mutations have also been implicated in the initiation and progression of MPN, including mutations that affect intracellular signaling pathways, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors and RNA splicing. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) refers to the acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenia and dysplastic hematopoiesis. Rarely, CHIP can progress to acute myeloid leukemia, either directly or via myeloid neoplasia or myelodysplastic syndrome; it can therefore be considered a precursor of hematopoietic neoplasms. Inflammation appears to play a key role in the development of PMF and other MPNs. Other factors, particularly older age and genetic predisposition, may also influence the initiation and development of these conditions."
9781910797433,ch10,"As in all cancer care, the follow-up of patients with ovarian cancer mostly lacks any prospective randomized evidence basis: guidelines are largely based on tradition, the wishes and experiences of patients and physicians, and rather arbitrary timelines depending on the type of examinations performed . In general, follow-up aims not only to diagnose relapse, but also to holistically assess and manage ongoing physical, psychological, emotional, financial and sexual survivorship issues . Nevertheless, to date, no prospective evidence has shown that such follow-up results in a significant survival benefit in patients with ovarian cancer . Follow-up . Traditionally, in accordance with various national and international guidelines, patients are followed up at 3-month intervals in the first 3 years, and 6-month intervals thereafter, depending on their symptoms and overall clinical picture . However, follow-up practice varies markedly, and each center usually has its own guidelines and protocols, without any evidence for the superiority of one approach over another . Typically, follow-up consists of an interview with the patient, assessment of any potential tumor-related symptoms, clinical examination and possibly also investigations for the diagnosis of common tumor-related symptoms (Table 10.1) . However, this approach failed to demonstrate any significant effect on patients' survival in the UK-based prospective randomized MRC/EORTC trial, in which there was no difference in overall survival between patients who received chemotherapy based on a rising CA125 level and those who did not receive chemotherapy until they were symptomatic (Figure 10.1) . In this study, however, only 6% of the patients underwent surgery for relapsed disease . Depending on the final analysis of the DESKTOP III survival data, follow-up for ovarian cancer may need to be reshaped and redefined, as it may be worthwhile detecting the disease while it is apparently operable and when the patient has a good performance status . The emerging trend of targeted maintenance treatments for advanced ovarian cancer is also reshaping the approach to follow-up, since in this situation patients are visiting their oncologists over prolonged periods, and assessments of treatment efficacy and adverse events are performed regularly . Patients undergoing fertility-sparing treatment should receive regular ultrasonographic examination of the contralateral ovary and the endometrial cavity to diagnose relapse in the remaining Müllerian organs . Depending on the initial stage, the patient's wishes and reproductive history and her overall response to cancer treatment, removal of the uterus and contralateral ovary may be discussed after completion of childbearing . There is increasing interest in the impact of psycho-oncologic support interventions in women treated for ovarian cancer . Palliative salvage surgery . Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer often present with symptoms of impaired intestinal transit or clinical bowel obstruction at relapse, which is attributable to the diffuse peritoneal dissemination of recurrent tumor . The use of novel targeted therapies with anti-angiogenic potential may favor fistula formation or intestinal perforation, and so recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer with the potential for such severe acute complications constitutes a therapeutic dilemma . Palliative surgery in patients with gastrointestinal and other symptoms of ovarian cancer recurrence therefore requires a multidisciplinary approach . Risks versus benefits . Any perceived benefits should be carefully balanced against the risks for each individual patient along with factors such as comorbidities, baseline quality of life, previous response to chemotherapy, length of treatment intervals and the patient's wishes . Intraoperative input from gynecologic oncologists is important to ensure that both the meaningful responses possible after palliative surgery and the likelihood of disease response to chemotherapy are duly considered when making intraoperative decisions . Endoscopic techniques such as placement of intestinal stents and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may allow the palliation of gastrointestinal symptoms, with reduced procedure-related morbidity in selected patients . Surgical intervention should be restricted to patients who have a distal mechanical bowel obstruction and in whom the formation of a proximal small bowel stoma is not likely to be necessary, as such high-output stomas significantly reduce patients' quality of life and necessitate permanent total parenteral nutrition . Preoperative imaging demonstrating the most proximal point of bowel obstruction should be used to identify patients with a level of obstruction that presents a high risk of iatrogenic short bowel syndrome . Considering the balance of risk and benefits, few patients are suitable for palliative defunctioning or bypass procedures, and therefore multidisciplinary teams with experience in managing such cases and their potential complications should be responsible for the careful selection and care of those who do undergo surgery . ","The value, type and role of follow-up in cancer care is not well defined and prospective randomized trials are scarce. The type of follow-up depends on whether the patient has undergone fertility-sparing surgery. Serial CA125 measurements have failed to show any survival benefit over observation alone. Follow-up should involve holistic aspects and psycho-oncologic support. Palliative surgery should be performed only after all conservative management options have been exhausted. Short bowel syndrome is a common complication after palliative surgery for bowel obstruction in relapsed disease."
9781910797631,chp8,"Suicide is a major public health problem, and each suicide act is tragic and preventable . Globally, more than half of all violent deaths are due to suicide, and in the USA twice as many people die by suicide as by homicide . Similarly, although suicide is most common among people aged over 70 years in nearly all world regions, there are marked differences in age and sex patterns across countries and regions . Many more people make suicide attempts or self-harming acts than kill themselves: self-harm is estimated to be 20 times more common than suicide, and a history of self-harm is an important risk factor for completed suicide . The reasons for suicide are complex and vary with age, sex, culture and ethnicity . Suicide is generally defined as the act of deliberately killing oneself; it is a fatal suicidal act . Epidemiology of suicide . Global rate changes . WHO data show that the absolute number of deaths by suicide has fallen by 10% since 2000, despite a growing world population . For some countries, such as Finland and Hungary, rates halved during this period, whereas in Korea there was a dramatic rise in suicide . Age trends . Global data show a picture of the rising prevalence of completed suicide with age . Worldwide, older people have the highest rate of completed suicide of any age group, with the pooled international rate increasing gradually with age . However, pooled rates mask considerable differences in age distributions in different nations . Over the last few decades, there has been a rising trend of youth suicide . Some similarities in suicide trends are apparent in the data from the UK and Australia, where the rates of suicide among young men increased from around 1970 until the early or mid-1990s but have subsequently declined . In almost all world regions and across all age groups, suicide is more common in men than in women . In rural China, there is an increased rate of suicide among women compared to men, and this is strongest in women aged 20-34 years . There are large-scale variations in suicide prevalence between nations and cultures . Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the USA, accounting for over 44 000 deaths in 2015 . (Because data have been age-standardized to the WHO Standard World Population, these rates differ from national data or those using other population standards . Figure 8.4 shows latest available suicide rates for OECD countries, and Figure 8.5 shows global suicide rates . Several reviews indicate that a protective relationship exists between religious beliefs and completed suicide . Unemployment, poverty and residential instability are associated with suicide in observational analyses within and between nations . High-risk occupational groups . Depression and suicide . Reviews of these findings show that 90% of suicide completers have a diagnosable mental disorder, although fewer (around 30%) have had contact with mental health services in the year before suicide . Although the rate of suicide in people with depression in the USA and UK is often quoted as 15%, this figure is based on a selective sample of patients with severe depression . Additionally, family conflict, serious physical illness and loneliness are all associated with completed suicide . Risk factors for suicide . There is general agreement between research evidence and clinical experience that the two key risk factors for suicide are . More general factors associated with suicide include . a family history of suicide, or other exposure to suicidal behavior involving family or peers or in media reports or fictional representations . Suicide in prisoners . A recent systematic review of risk factors, based on nearly 5000 prison suicides in 12 countries, has identified that risk is strongly associated with . a history of attempted suicide . Self-harm . People who die by suicide represent only a fraction of the number who harm themselves in response to life problems or contemplate suicide . Acts of self-harm are relatively common, particularly among young people . This notwithstanding, self-harm acts are a strong predictor of future suicidal behavior, and require careful and sensitive assessment and management . A history of self-harm is the strongest predictor of future suicide, increasing the risk by 50-100-fold compared with people who have not self-harmed . Thoughts of suicide may occur at the same time as thoughts and acts of self-harm, but the relationship between such ideas and resulting acts is not straightforward . Management of self-harm . Suicide prevention programs . A strategy for suicide prevention requires increased awareness of suicidal behaviors and approaches to their prevention . ","Suicide is strongly associated with depression, but despite depression being more common among adult women, men are around twice as likely to kill themselves in most countries, and three to four times more likely in many high-income nations. Self-harm is most common in adolescent girls and young women and usually does not involve an intention to endanger life. Nonetheless, a history of self-harm is an important predictor of future suicide, increasing the risk by 50-100-fold compared with people who have not self-harmed. In addition to previous self-harm, risk factors for suicide include depression, substance misuse, a family history of suicide, male sex, being separated or divorced, and being in custody. Assessment practice following self-harm needs to be sensitive and skilled, focusing on the presence of risk factors for suicide and basing care plans on clearly defined risks and the capacity of the individual and their support network to manage problems and take responsibility for safety."
9781912776238,ch5,"The ability to switch patients between different brands of the same biologic is critical for developing a competitive drug market to check costs . In Europe, regulators and clinical studies have supported the practicality of brand switching between originators and biosimilars as part of the annual drug tender process - which is the European definition of 'interchangeable' . In Australia, it is known as 'flagging' . The USA and Australia have specific regulatory requirements for biosimilars that can be substituted . Automatic substitution of drugs by pharmacists is considered to create price competition between manufacturers that will reduce costs and promote patient uptake, analogous to the effect of generic substitution with small molecule drugs (Figure 5.1) . Currently, postmarketing data collected for a biosimilar, without corresponding data derived from an appropriately designed, prospective, controlled switching study or studies, would probably not be sufficient to support a demonstration of interchangeability . To encourage biosimilar manufacturers to create the data to support automatic substitution of biosimilars, the FDA has suggested 1 year of marketing exclusivity for the first approved interchangeable biosimilar within each class . Just as automatic substitution of generic drugs was promoted in the USA through the FDA's Orange Book, listing approved substitutions, the FDA has similar listings for interchangeable biosimilars in an FDA Purple Book . In Europe, policies for automatic substitution of medicines are considered outside the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA); despite one shared medicines regulator, generic drug substitution is mandatory in 13 countries, voluntary in 14 and forbidden in five . In Australia, the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule lists drugs with both A-flagging and B-flagging . To gain A-flag status, a drug developer must submit evidence of bioequivalence or therapeutic equivalence to the Australian medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration . The lack of A-flagging does not necessarily reflect a lack of safety or efficacy, as often these are drugs approved in an earlier regulatory era . B-flagging indicates that these brands are also equivalent, but that it is not known if there is equivalence between brands marked 'a' and brands marked 'b' . Biosimilars are typically approved for most, if not all, the indications of the originator brand, but without a need to provide clinical trial data using the biosimilar in all those indications . This extrapolation may be made by the provision of relevant scientific data that demonstrates biosimilarity: physicochemical data, structural analysis, in vitro function, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data and some clinical data . The clinical study is likely to involve the most sensitive patient group/study endpoint(s), selected in discussion with regulators . Therefore, at launch, the comparability of a biosimilar with its reference product may have been demonstrated in only one of the reference product's indications . Further data may be required in order to demonstrate comparability if, for example, the drug has multiple sites of action, particularly if these have different relevance in different indications or if there are differences between indications in terms of efficacy, safety or immunogenicity . Although clinical data are an important part of the regulatory review for a biosimilar, comparability with the reference drug based on non-clinical studies is an inherent part of the biosimilar pathway . If the biosimilar medicine is 'essentially the same' as the reference medicine, then it will behave clinically the same way in all indications . The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) indicates whether indications have been approved on the basis of extrapolation or data from comparative clinical studies . Extrapolation for biosimilars in oncology will be critical in reducing the costs of development of follow-on biologics . By reducing the clinical trial requirement of drug regulation from proving activity in each approved indication to demonstrating equivalence in the most sensitive indication, trial requirements could be five times lower for a biosimilar; see Table 5.1 . Even then, confirmatory clinical trials still represent 70% of the costs of biosimilar development and a large part of the drug development timeline . Note that, despite the approval of an extrapolated indication for a biosimilar by Europe's regulator, this may not be available in all countries because of individual national patent laws . This is why one biosimilar approved at a European level may be marketed as bioidenticals with several brand names in individual European countries, with each bioidentical drug having approval for only a subset of the originator drug indications . Biosimilars in the USA may also carry a 'skinny' or limited label in which not all of the drug's approved indications are approved for one biosimilar agent (for example, rituximab) . ","Switching between biological drugs is a key mechanism for driving down costs. 'Interchangeable' has different meanings in the USA and Europe. In the USA, interchangeability is the automatic substitution of prescriptions at a pharmacy level, whereas in Europe it refers to a physician-led decision, often at the level of the medicines formulary committee. European regulators support the safety of biosimilar switching as part of an annual tender process. In Europe, individual countries may have patent laws that prevent the extrapolation of indications for biosimilars, even if the indication has been approved by the European Medicines Agency. Similar regulations allowing for limited indications because of patent protection are also occurring in the US market."
9781910797587,chp10,"Surgery is often the final stage of treatment for many patients with arthritis . The aim of surgical procedures is to reduce pain and improve function; these procedures involve techniques that . preserve or restore joint surfaces . replace joints with artificial implants . fuse joints (arthrodeses) . Patient selection . Each case must be assessed individually, and should include an analysis of the patient's . functional limitations . general health . This chapter provides a general overview of a number of relatively common procedures . Osteotomy involves incision with possible excision of bone to correct a joint deformity . This procedure is generally reserved for younger patients, and even children, in an attempt to prevent or reduce premature OA . High tibial osteotomy of the knee may be useful in younger patients with medial compartment OA and early-stage radiographic disease . Total knee or hip replacement . Knee and hip replacements are amongst the most commonly performed surgical procedures . The indications for joint replacement usually include moderate-to-severe pain that is unresponsive to non-surgical measures and radiographic evidence of severe OA structural damage . With modern techniques, 90% or more of hip and knee replacements function 10-20 years after surgery (risk of revision surgery of 1% per year), and approximately 90% of patients will get a good reduction in pain after joint replacement . People referred for surgery should understand both the benefits and risks of the particular procedure . These complaints are more common in knee replacements . Postoperative expectations . More recently, next-day discharge and even same-day outpatient surgery has become common . There remains much debate among joint replacement surgeons about postoperative restriction of movement and functional limitation . Postoperative joint dislocation is uncommon, but patients need to be aware that certain positions and movements may need to be avoided . Joint-conserving surgery . As experience grows with joint-conserving surgeries, they may well offer opportunities to patients who are too young to be considered for joint replacement surgery . Unicompartmental arthroplasty of the knee involves replacing of one half of the joint (medial or lateral) whilst preserving the other half . Replacement of the medial compartment of the knee is most common . Benefits of this procedure compared with total joint replacement include a smaller surgical incision, shorter length of stay in hospital and quicker rehabilitation . Long-term outcome studies, and joint registry data in particular, demonstrate decreased survivorship after partial knee replacement compared with total knee replacement . Femoral head resurfacing involves replacement of the surface of the femoral head without removal of the neck of the femur . Although this procedure is still being performed, the incidence of resurfacing arthroplasty of the hip has fallen to a small percentage of what it was just 10 years ago . Tissue engineering . Surgery for other OA joint sites . Whilst surgery is most commonly performed for OA of the knee or hip joints, other joints may also benefit from surgical intervention . Hand surgery . OA of the trapeziometacarpal joint is a common reason for hand surgery . This joint can be fused to eliminate motion from the problem joint, or it can be reconstructed . Sometimes a joint replacement implant is inserted, and ligament reconstruction may also be performed . Such procedures have few complications and high rates of pain relief . Foot and ankle surgery . First metatarsophalangeal joint OA can be improved with cheilectomy (removal of osteophytes) or arthrodesis . Surgical options for OA of the ankle joint include joint fusion and joint replacement surgery . Joint replacement has the advantage of preserving some movement at the talocrural joint, but has a higher failure rate . Fusion may be equally effective in relieving pain if there is adequate movement in the neighboring joints to compensate for the fixed talocrural joint, and has fewer complications . Shoulder surgery . Shoulder replacement has experienced the most rapid increase in frequency of any joint replacement procedure, and is the most common surgery for shoulder arthritis . It does, however, involve a prolonged rehabilitation and recovery period . Other options include joint fusion or hemiarthroplasty, where the humeral head is replaced but the glenoid surface is preserved . Debridement and synovectomy procedures can be performed arthroscopically . ","Surgery should be considered only when appropriate non-surgical treatment approaches have been exhausted. Hip and knee replacement surgery is well established and may be one of the most effective therapies for these joints. Other surgical techniques include joint preservation and joint fusion but currently are not widely adopted in the setting of severe hip or knee osteoarthritis. Appropriate education, advice and rehabilitation should be provided, both preoperatively and postoperatively, for people undergoing surgery."
9781908541703,ch_3,"Moreover, the clinical trials process, which is essential to increasing our understanding of cancer, is all about risk . Three definitions form the basis of risk assessment . risk or odds . consequence or harm . Risk is a measurement of likelihood, or how often an event takes place . Explaining the concept of risk . People have some sense of the total effect of a specific risk . The event risks are constantly changing . Thus, when explaining the concept of risk to a patient, there are a number of points worth considering . Set risk in context by comparing the risk of breast cancer with that of trauma or heart disease: for example, for non-smoking women, the 10-year risks of death from breast cancer and heart disease are similar until the age of 60 (typically <= 1%) . Make the distinction between risk and consequence (see below) . Explain that risk is a proportional quantity (Figure 2.1 - see text for full figure description) . Explain that all interventions, including doing nothing, involve a trade-off of risks . This is not peculiar to breast cancer risk but reflects the fundamental difficulty in truly understanding the meaning of probability . The risk reduction can be presented two ways . as a proportion of the treatment population, sometimes called the absolute benefit, calculated as the risk without treatment minus the risk with treatment, in this case 82.8 - 74.2 = 8.6% . Again, the risk reduction can be presented two ways . Consequence or harm represents the severity of the effect of the risk event should it happen, which also carries a negative connotation . The total effect of a given risk is the product of the risk and the consequence . There is an important corollary to the notion that no risk exists in isolation . Conceptually, the proper approach to the assessment of risk would be to sum the product of all possible risks and their consequences . A small proportionate advance against a high-frequency risk may be of greater consequence than a large advance against a rare risk . The risk in 'real terms' . Describing the risk of developing breast cancer as 1 in 10-12 is true, yet unhelpful, because this figure is the cumulative lifetime risk . It is important to explain what any increase in relative risk means in real terms . Yet if she is 30 years old her risk doubles to 2/1000/year or 2% in a decade, which might seem insignificant against the other risks of living in a modern urban society . Furthermore, any increases in the relative risks, particularly due to family history, are not distributed symmetrically throughout a woman's lifetime, but tend to occur before the age of 60, after which the risk levels are not dissimilar to the higher risk at that age . Early data suggested that the breast cancer risk of women who carry mutations could be as high as 85%, but more recent data from Europe indicate that the risk is of the order of 50% . Treatment of early breast cancer . Proportional risk is perhaps the most important concept to arise from the many trials of systemic (adjuvant) therapy for early breast cancer . Each type of treatment reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence by a relatively constant proportion . Thus, in premenopausal women, chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence by 33% and oophorectomy by about 25%, while in postmenopausal women tamoxifen reduces the risk by about 40% . Thus, the benefit for a given woman in absolute terms depends on both the effect of treatment on the relative risk and the underlying individual risk factors . Fundamental to interpreting estimates of benefit is the understanding that the proportion being calculated relates to the number of adverse events, not the number of individuals at risk . If adjuvant chemotherapy produces a relative risk reduction of about 30% then, in absolute terms, the patient gains 30% of the 10% risk of recurrence, which is about 3% . On the other hand, if the same woman has four nodes involved, her 10-year risk of recurrence is about 50% . First, the data from which these recommendations derive are generally specific for the risk of breast cancer; competing adverse risks, including the toxicity of treatment, are not considered . Thus, if the risk of an adverse event is 25%, then 1 in 4 of those who receive the treatment will experience the effect . Clearly, the greater the risk of recurrence the more likely people will be willing to accept toxicity . ",Risk is a poorly understood concept - it has negative connotations when in reality it is neutral. Risk measures the likelihood that an event will take place. Risk is a proportional quantity; change in risk can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. Consequence represents the severity of effect of an event. Decision-making involves balancing of risks and considering trade-offs.
9781910797082,ch05,"Patients with mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis comprise the majority of those requiring treatment . In general, most of those who remain adherent to their topical therapy can be managed successfully . A large number of different topical preparations are available (Table 5.1); topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs are considered first-line therapy for most patients . Previous therapy . Sometimes expectations are unrealistic; if the patient was hoping for a cure, disappointment will ensue if the psoriasis relapses off therapy . Always ensure that the treatment duration has been adequate and the patient has adhered to the treatment plan . Local side effects and poor cosmetic acceptability are the most frequent reasons for patient dissatisfaction with previous therapy . Choice of formulation and type of therapy will depend on both patient preference and the site/pattern of psoriasis . Patient motivation . Some patients are unlikely to apply therapy more than once a day on a regular basis; others may be willing and able to spend a significant amount of time applying treatments . However, other patients would find this unacceptable . Such variations in patient acceptability should be taken into account when prescribing . Topical corticosteroids . On stopping therapy, rebound and a more inflammatory form of psoriasis may develop . Despite these hazards, corticosteroids form an integral component of topical therapy for chronic plaque psoriasis . These include . applying the agent once daily . Side effects, safety and cosmetic acceptability . Topical corticosteroids are popular with patients, and remain first-line therapy in the USA, because of their immediate efficacy and cosmetic acceptability . Local side effects include . masking of local infection (rarely a problem in psoriasis) . rapid relapse or rebound of psoriasis on stopping therapy . Rarely, patients may exhibit sensitivity to the corticosteroid molecule itself . The events that contribute to the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin D analogs in psoriasis include . However, treatment with topical corticosteroids alone carries a significant risk of skin atrophy, tachyphylaxis and rebound psoriasis on stopping therapy . Recent studies have shown that combination therapy with a corticosteroid and calcipotriol can be used to circumvent these problems . An advantage of this preparation is that once daily application is as efficacious as twice daily, thus making for better patient adherence . Local skin irritation occurs in up to 20% of patients using calcipotriol, but only rarely requires withdrawal of therapy . Coal tar . Coal-tar 1% cream is probably as effective as a mild steroid . In practice, coal tar is rarely used alone . However, there are no studies demonstrating any superior efficacy over corticosteroid alone . Use of these forms of therapy requires significant patient motivation and time, and supervision by a trained dermatology nurse . Coal tar is also widely used in combination with phototherapy (see Chapter 6) . Coal-tar products have a distinctive smell, which some patients find unpleasant, and poor cosmetic acceptability . To date, long-term studies of patients with psoriasis treated with coal-tar products have not shown an increased incidence of cancer . Dithranol (anthralin) . These actions may reduce the epidermal hyperproliferation seen in psoriasis . Dithranol is extremely effective in psoriasis . These effects are dose-related, so therapy should be initiated at very low concentrations . Few studies have compared tazarotene with other topical therapies . The drop-out rate for patients using tazarotene was higher than for those using the corticosteroid . Topical therapy for other forms of psoriasis . Combining tazarotene with corticosteroids reduces this atrophy and produces more sustained results . Patients must remain under very close supervision throughout therapy . Flexural sites, the face and genitalia are particularly vulnerable to the local side effects of corticosteroids and irritant products . Facial psoriasis . Side effects include burning and stinging . Mild-to-moderate corticosteroids combined with topical antimicrobial agents may be given as eardrops, if necessary . Nail psoriasis is difficult to manage, and topical agents are of very limited benefit . ","Approximately 70% of patients (those with mild or moderate disease) can be managed using topical therapy alone. Time spent detailing the practicalities of topical therapy with patients is crucial to achieving a successful therapeutic outcome. A wide variety of topical therapies is available; topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs, or a combination of both in a single preparation, are considered first-line therapy for most patients. Efficacy and cosmetic acceptability are key determinants of patients' adherence to therapy. Consideration should be given to the body site being treated, since this influences which active ingredient and formulation to prescribe."

Programs that focus on enhancing patient self-care activities, reduce HF and all-cause hospitalizations but have no effect on mortality . In a Cochrane review of 25 studies involving more than 8000 patients, telemonitoring significantly reduced mortality and HF rehospitalization . General non-pharmacological management may be as important as the prescription of HF-specific medications . The majority of HF care is conducted in the home by either the patient and/or the caregiver . Non-adherence to HF management plans can be related to patient and/or caregiver misconceptions and lack of knowledge . Self-care involves active participation in the maintenance and management of HF . In order to promote increased adherence for patients with HF, the following are recommended . a strong relationship between the healthcare team and patients . Symptom recognition . Weight monitoring, and fluid and sodium management . The maintenance of a normal blood volume is paramount in the management of HF . The management of volume overload in HF patients frequently requires intravenous diuretics and modification to fluid and sodium intake . If there is no change in status the patient should be encouraged to seek the assistance of the healthcare provider or HF nurse . There is no evidence to suggest fluid limitation is useful in patients with mild-to-moderate HF . Multiple factors contribute to physical deconditioning in patients with HF .

Obesity can increase the risk of developing HF or worsen symptoms . Saturated fat intake should be limited in all patients with HF and especially those who have concomitant coronary heart disease . Subclinical or clinical malnutrition or cardiac cachexia is a common problem in patients with HF and contributes to weakness and fatigue . Patients should receive advice on healthy eating to maintain optimal nutrition . Excessive alcohol intake can be a cause of HF . It has the potential to increase the risk of arrhythmias, increase blood pressure and add to the fluid burden of the HF patient . Such problems adversely affect the quality of life of the patient and their partner . There is, however, little evidence related to sexual activity in patients with HF and it has been suggested that sexual activity is likely to be safe . Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common complaint in patients with HF . Therapy should start with optimization of HF . Sildenafil is not currently recommended for patients with severe HF (class III-IV symptoms) and is contraindicated if the patient is using a nitrate preparation . The prevalence of depression in patients with HF is significantly higher than in age- and sex-matched controls; approximately 20% of patients with HF also have depression . SSRIs can increase sodium levels, so patients should be monitored during active treatment . Immunization has no protective effect in younger patients . Yearly influenza vaccination and vaccination against pneumococcal diseases should be undertaken for patients with symptomatic HF . Travel for patients with HF is possible but complex, and preparation is the key . The driving rules for patients with HF vary between countries and clinicians should refer to national guidelines (see Further reading, page 147) . In general, patients with a commercial driving license and symptomatic HF are banned from driving . Exercise or other functional testing may be required depending on the likely cause of the HF . The resulting hypoxia could have negative cardiovascular consequences in patients with HF . Significant hypoxia may have a deleterious effect on patients suffering from LV dysfunction . However, in patients with HF, pulmonary vasoconstriction may help protect the pulmonary microvasculature from increased pressure . No changes in blood pressure or dyspnea were noted in patients with NYHA class II HF who were tested during a simulated 7-hour flight . Patients with HF are at moderate risk of DVT/venous thromboembolism (VTE) while travelling by air . Compression stockings have been shown to reduce risk in the non-HF population . Prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin may be considered in patients with severe HF on long intercontinental flights . ","General non-pharmacological strategies, including self-care education, treatment adherence, symptom recognition, weight control, sodium and fluid management and healthy lifestyle choices are as important as heart failure (HF)-specific medications. Patients with HF appear to benefit from exercise as much as others, with a documented improvement in quality of life and a tendency towards reductions in morbidity and mortality. Patients with a private driving license are generally restricted from driving only if they have advanced or uncontrolled HF; those with a commercial driving license are banned from driving until further testing. Most patients who have had an episode of acute HF should be able to fly, if stable, in 6 weeks. There should be no restriction for patients with chronic HF, although those with NYHA class III or IV should consider airport assistance and request the availability of in-flight oxygen. In general, there is no convincing evidence that electromagnetic interference, cosmic radiation or vibration have an important effect on the function of pacemakers or implantable cardiac defibrillators."
9781912776696,hh-4,"Common endpoint types are . time to event . Continuous endpoints are measured on a continuum of possible values over time: for example, a change in bone mineral density or blood pressure . Time to event . Duration of response is an endpoint that is measured from the time of first response to progression . Summary statistics provide a quick and simple description of a set of data values . Usually, the sample's average (mean), middle (median) or most common (mode) value is used . The mean is the arithmetic average, id est the sum of all values divided by the number of values . The mean is also a good measure of comparison for samples with count endpoints, but these are usually calculated as means per unit of time to account for different observation periods for different patients . The median is the middle value when the data values are placed in order from smallest to largest . The mode is the most common value (see Figure 1.1) . Comparing the means of binary endpoints makes no sense . Standard deviation (SD) is a measure of patient-to-patient variability . The SD is the average distance of all data values from the mean . Sample and population . Treatment A is better than treatment B . Treatment B is better than treatment A . There is no evidence for a difference between treatments . In Example 1.2, the conclusion drawn is that treatment A is better than treatment B . By extrapolating from the sample to the population, it can be concluded that treating the population with treatment A will produce a better outcome, on average, than treating the population with treatment B . Different symbols for the statistics of interest are used when considering the complete population . These parameters represent the true values in the population as a whole . Sampling variation . Patients respond differently to treatments . In Example 1.2, the treatment difference was 4.7 mmHg . The observed treatment difference in a study is only ever an estimate of the true difference: in no sense is the result the true difference that would be obtained if the complete population was studied . If the trial above was conducted 100 times, 100 values for the difference in the treatment means would be obtained . The SD associated with those 100 values is known as the SE . It is a measure of the inherent variability in the statistic being calculated . If the observed treatment differences are similar over 100 trials, the SE will be small, indicating little variability in the outcome . The SE is an important measure, as it is used to calculate confidence intervals and p -values . As discussed above, the precise value for treatment difference can never be obtained, only an estimate of its value . However, an interval (a range of values) can be constructed around that estimate within which the true population value is likely to lie . The 95% confidence interval (CI) contains the true population value 95% of the time . The 95% CI for a treatment difference is given by . Observed difference - 2 x SE to Observed difference + 2 x SE . Hypothesis testing . To test for superiority, id est to demonstrate that treatments are different, the null hypothesis (H) is that the treatment effects (exempli gratia the mean effects) are equal . where µ is the mean value for treatment A and µ is the mean value for treatment B . Two-sided and one-sided p -values . The p -values discussed above are two-sided p -values as they detect differences in either direction, id est treatment A is better than treatment B or treatment B is better than treatment A . where θ and θ are the true response proportions for treatment A+B+C and treatment B+C, respectively . As discussed above, treatment effects can be expressed as differences between two means or differences between two proportions . Interpreting OR and RR values . An OR of 1 corresponds to equal treatment effects . Likewise, an RR of 1 corresponds to equal treatment effects . Statistical testing . For comparison of two treatment means for continuous or score endpoints, the appropriate test is the two-sample t -test . Normal versus non-normal data distribution . The Mann-Whitney U -test takes the ranks of the data points in the two groups combined and compares the mean rank in treatment group 1 with the mean rank in treatment group 2 . ","The type of statistical method used to analyze trial data depends on the type of endpoint being measured. Common endpoint types are continuous, score, binary, ordered categorical, count and time to event. Summary statistics provide a simple descriptive value for a data sample, which enables comparison of data sets. The mean (arithmetic average) is the most common measure used for continuous and score data with a normal or symmetric distribution. The median is the preferred measure for data with a skewed distribution. Proportions are compared for binary and ordered categorical endpoints. The standard deviation is a measure of patient-to-patient variability. The standard error is a measure of the extent of sampling variation. A 95% confidence interval is a range of values within which the true population value lies 95% of the time. The null hypothesis usually states that treatment effects are equal. The alternative hypothesis is that they are not equal. These hypotheses give two-sided p -values. One-sided p -values can be obtained when looking for differences only in one direction. The p -value is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates whether to accept the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis. For two-sided testing, a p -value <= 0.05 shows that there is statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis, id est there is a statistically significant difference between the treatments. The odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) are used to express the difference between binary endpoints. OR > 1 or RR > 1 indicates that the odds or risk of an event occurring, respectively, are higher in the treatment group. The two-sample t -test is used to analyze data with a normal or approximately normal distribution. Skewed data sets can be transformed (exempli gratia by log) before analysis with the t -test, or analyzed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U -test."
9781910797556,chp4,"Although myasthenia gravis (MG) is a very treatable disease in most patients, approximately 10-15% have very difficult-to-control disease . Given the fluctuations in severity of symptoms in patients with MG, there are inherent difficulties in assessing baseline disease severity and response to treatment . Electrophysiological studies, disease severity rating scales and patient-reported outcome measures are all tools with which disease activity and response to treatment have been measured in MG . Measuring antibodies . Intuitively, the measurement of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titers serves as an attractive biomarker to discern disease activity and response to treatment in patients with MG . However, it is generally accepted that there is no reliable correlation between serum AChR antibody titers and clinical severity in generalized MG . A recent study using a commercial assay noted a high positive predictive value but a low negative predictive value when correlating titers with several validated outcome measures in MG . Better prognostic biomarkers for MG are needed to more sensitively determine which treatments might work better for specific patients, to better assess the response to treatment over time and for use in clinical trial design in studies of MG . Measurement of jitter on single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) has shown promise as a useful biomarker of disease activity in MG (see page 25 -) . One recent study found that jitter is a sensitive measure of disease severity in MG; absolute or percentage change in mean jitter from one electrophysiological study to another in a given patient has a potential role as a biomarker . Clinical rating instruments . Several clinical rating instruments have been developed to measure disease severity and quality of life, in patients with MG . The quantitative MG score (QMG) is the best studied objective outcome measure in MG, and it has been used in many drug trials in MG . It is a severity score, determined from measurement of 13 objective items (Table 4.1), with measures varying between 0 (normal) to 39 (maximum severity) . The MG activities of daily living score (MG-ADL) is a simple eight-point questionnaire, designed to complement the QMG, which enquires about common symptoms reported by patients with MG (Table 4.2) . No specialized training is required to administer the scale, which can be completed in less than 10 minutes . The MG composite scale (MGC) consists of test items that measure symptoms and signs of MG, with weighted response options to highlight aspects of weakness that may be more serious such as bulbar and respiratory function . It was devised using individual test items taken from existing MG-specific scales based on their performance during two clinical trials of mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of MG . The MGC consists of a combination of physician-measured signs and patient-reported symptoms (Table 4.3) . The MG quality of life 15 scale (MG-QOL15) . MG-QOL15 is a 15-item MG-specific self-administered scale, the test items of which address MG-specific psychological well-being and social functioning . It can also be used to follow an individual patient's response over time to assist in assessing the degree of disease severity and to determine the efficacy of treatment, controlling for other potential confounding factors . In addition, like the other scales discussed, the MG-QOL15 has served to assist in following groups of patients with MG over time in clinical trials . Both scales take less than 5 minutes to administer . The MG impairment index (MGII) was recently developed, importantly taking into account patient input in construction of the scale . Using this patient-centered approach, the scale aims to measure the impairments that are judged to be most relevant by patients, particularly those that may be triggered by activity or that fluctuate and might not be easily assessed during a clinic visit . Like the MGC, however, several objective examination items were also incorporated into this scale . The PIS should be determined by a clinician skilled in the evaluation of patients with MG since it is based on careful clinical evaluation, taking into account patient-reported symptoms and signs . Monitoring treatment response . The frequency of monitoring will depend on the patient's response to therapy and fluctuations in disease activity . When patients with MG are deemed to be refractory to conventional treatment, aggressive treatments may be needed to improve quality of life, reduce morbidity and prevent life-threatening crises and death . Development of new treatments should be evaluated for these patients in the future . ","Electrophysiological studies, disease severity rating scales and patient-reported outcome measures are all tools with which disease activity and response to treatment can be measured in myasthenia gravis (MG). There is no reliable correlation between serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titers and clinical severity in generalized MG; better prognostic biomarkers for MG are needed to better assess response to treatment over time. Measurement of jitter on single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) may be a useful biomarker of disease activity in MG. Absolute or percentage change in mean jitter from one electrophysiological study to another has a potential role as a biomarker provided the parameters of the study, such as time of day and time after medication, are kept the same. The quantitative MG score, which can be completed in 20-30 minutes and requires no specialized equipment, is the best studied objective outcome measure in MG. It is recommended for use in all prospective studies of therapy for MG. Other useful tools for assessing response to treatment include the MG activities of daily living score (MG-ADL), MG composite scale (MGC), revised MG quality of life 15 scale (MG-QOL15R), MG impairment index (MGII) and MGFA assessment of post-intervention status (PIS)."
9783318066685,ch5,"Gene editing is the manipulation of the genetic material of a living cell or organism by the disruption, deletion, correction or insertion of a DNA sequence . Following their identification, these endogenous DNA repair mechanisms have been utilized for the purposes of gene editing . The crucial requirement is the introduction of DSBs specifically and precisely at target genomic sites of interest . The MN gene-editing platform utilizes homing endonucleases, such as I- Cre I and I- Sce I, but re-engineers them to target novel specific genomic sites . The use of MNs for gene editing has shown promise in various studies . Nevertheless, the exploitation of this technology has been restricted, mainly as a result of the high degree of protein engineering required to generate MNs with novel target specificity . Zinc finger nucleases . Multifinger arrays, comprising multiple ZF domains linked in tandem, can be generated with novel and unique genomic target specificities . The nuclease domain of the Fok I restriction endonuclease can function independently from its DNA-binding domain and be fused to ZF domain assemblies . This allows the synthesis of programmable chimeric endonucleases with novel DNA-binding specificity - ZFNs . A disadvantage of ZFNs is that the targeting of new sites requires a high level of protein engineering, which makes it challenging for non-specialists to utilize the platform . Transcription activator-like effector nucleases . The TALEN system utilizes transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas . Individual TALEs recognize DNA bases with a simple one-to-one cipher determining binding specificity - one type of TALE binds to only one DNA base . Each highly conserved TALE repeat binds a specific single DNA base pair, with two hypervariable amino acid residues conveying specificity . Four TALEs specific to different DNA bases can be coupled together in various orders to target diverse but particular DNA sequences . On this basis, novel DNA-binding proteins, with custom DNA-binding specificity, have been engineered by linking modular TALE repeats into long arrays . Subsequently, as with ZFs, TALEs have been fused to the Fok l restriction endonuclease domain, generating programmable TALENs that function as pairs for the introduction of DSBs . The TALENs system can be 'programmed' by engineering the TALE repeat sequence-specific targeting region . TALENs have been used to efficiently trigger both the NHEJ and HDR pathways in human cells . A further strength is the comparative ease of engineering new arrays when compared with ZFNs and MNs . Target diseases . Potentially, the systems described in the preceding pages can be used in gene therapies for the genetic manipulation of cells to treat a wide range of diseases . Following the introduction of site-specific DSBs by any of the programmable nuclease systems described, various types of genomic alterations can be exploited as prospective therapies, utilizing either the endogenous NHEJ or HDR DNA repair machinery . These gene-editing approaches can disrupt, delete or correct genetic sequences that cause disease, as well as insert exogenous therapeutic DNA sequences (Figure 5.3) . Disruption of gene targets has been achieved by the induction of NHEJ and generation of indels at a targeted DSB site to shift the reading frame and 'knock out' the gene . Other potential targets for the gene knockout approach for disease treatment are essential genes for, and those conferring virulence or antibiotic resistance to, human pathogens; these may serve as an alternative to current antibiotic and antiviral treatments . Deletion of large genomic sequences, even at multiple megabase sizes, can be achieved by the simultaneous generation of two DSBs flanking the target . Disorders where the removal of large genomic sequences may have therapeutic benefit are prospective targets for this approach . HDR can be induced for precise and efficient gene correction of disease-causing mutations by targeted generation of a DSB along with the supply of an exogenous DNA repair template . Such a repair template should have homology to the break site and the correct sequence in place of the mutant . In addition, large DNA sequences, such as therapeutic transgenes or missing exonic sequences, flanked by arms of homology can be inserted into specific target sites using a donor template via DSB-induced HDR . For example, attempts utilizing this method have been made to develop HIV therapies combining CCR5 gene knockout with gene insertion of anti-HIV factors . ","Engineered endonucleases can be designed to target virtually any DNA sequence of choice using bioinformatics tools. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages associated with each type of endonuclease. The endonuclease-mediated double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA is repaired by two mechanisms: efficient but imprecise non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or inefficient but precise homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ and HDR mechanisms can be exploited to repair loss-of-function mutations or disrupt gain-of-function mutations. Ex vivo and in situ in vivo applications of gene editing are being tested in the clinic, with a number of systemic in vivo trials starting."
9781910797662,ch04,"Tests for urinary markers of urothelial malignancy have recently become commercially available, although tests for other urinary markers are still at the laboratory stage . Bladder tumor antigen (BTA) stat ® test is performed on unmodified (unbuffered) urine using a similar method to pregnancy tests, and results are available within 5 minutes . The second-generation BTA stat test detects a different protein from that detected by the original test, and has better sensitivity but similar specificity . The test, which can be performed at the time of cystoscopy, is claimed to be approximately twice as sensitive as cytology, and is particularly effective for detecting the low- and intermediate-grade tumors that cytology misses . Some reports indicate that the BTA stat test may be more useful than cytology; however, this opinion remains controversial . Trials will determine the role of the BTA stat test and whether it can indeed reduce the use of cystoscopy . BTA TRAK ® is a quantitative test that measures the same protein as that detected by the BTA stat test . The level of tumor-associated protein appears to correlate directly with increasing stage and grade of tumor . This test may therefore allow serial follow-up of patients, and indicate response to therapy and prognosis for recurring disease . This test measures a nuclear matrix protein (NMP) secreted by some bladder tumors . NMP22 is present in transitional cell tumors and can be detected by immunoassay . The test has to be performed in a laboratory . They may also be useful in dictating the frequency of cystoscopy for recurrence in patients with known bladder cancer . Current consensus is that none of the tests alone is sufficiently sensitive to replace cystoscopy in diagnosing or excluding urinary bladder cancer . The upper tracts (ureter and renal pelvis) should be imaged in all patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer . It has 69% sensitivity and 97% specificity for upper-tract tumors . As radiological imaging cannot sufficiently evaluate the bladder, cystoscopy is a required part of the evaluation for all patients . If a patient is found to have low-grade bladder cancer on biopsy, no further imaging is required . However, if muscle-invasive disease is present, staging with chest, abdominal and pelvic CT is necessary . Cystoscopy is required in all patients in order to evaluate the bladder . Diagnostic cystoscopy may be omitted if a bladder tumor is obvious on cross-sectional imaging; however, most urologists perform the procedure in order to inform surgical management, and it allows the patient to be informed of the likely diagnosis of bladder cancer . When a bladder tumor is identified by imaging or cystoscopy, the next step is to perform a transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) under general anesthesia using a rigid cystoscope . All visible papillary disease should be completely resected in the case of a probable NMIBC . Site-directed biopsy of remote normal-appearing mucosa is indicated only for high-grade tumors . Cytological examination of exfoliated cells is part of the hematuria evaluation for all patients . When a bladder tumor is diagnosed, cytology is useful to determine the grade as, by definition, positive cytology denotes high-grade malignant cells . Cytology is relatively insensitive in low-grade disease . Note that cytological evaluation of urine may be compromised if performed soon after urinary tract instrumentation . Transurethral resection of the tumor(s) is the mainstay of both diagnosis and initial management . However, extensive resections of large invasive tumors may serve no useful purpose, because cystectomy may be needed shortly . Deep biopsy at the juncture of the tumor and the muscular wall may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of muscle involvement . Small, obviously low-grade papillary and superficial tumors do not warrant such biopsies, however . Biopsy should be performed under the following circumstances . multiple papillary tumors . tumors that appear solid but are resectable . bladders with erythematous areas that may represent CIS . if chemoradiation with bladder conservation is being considered . to determine whether the prostate/bladder neck is free of CIS in patients for whom orthotopic bladder reconstruction is planned after cystectomy . ","The investigation of a patient with suspected bladder cancer should include urinalysis, cross-sectional upper-tract imaging and cystoscopy. Expert pathological review of biopsy specimens is critical to determining appropriate treatment. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) is used to stage invasive disease. Urinary markers are not yet sufficiently sensitive for diagnosis but may be useful in following up patients with superficial disease."
9781910797310,chp1,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women in the USA and worldwide . In Europe, lung cancer in women is set to overtake breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer-related mortality . Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for the other 15% . Tobacco smoke is the most important cause of lung cancer . The number of cigarettes smoked, but more importantly the length of time that patients have smoked for, is proportional to the risk of developing lung cancer . Evidence from the landmark 1964 Surgeon General's report estimated that an average male smoker had a nine- to tenfold increased risk of developing lung cancer compared with a 'never smoker' . For heavy smokers (more than 25 cigarettes per day) the risk is at least 20-fold . Ex-smokers who have quit for more than 15 years show an 80-90% reduction in their risk of lung cancer compared with persistent smokers . Approximately 1 in 9 smokers develop lung cancer . Individual susceptibility to developing lung cancer is affected by genetic predisposition and other environmental factors . Many occupational exposures increase the risk of developing lung cancer (Table 1.1) . Patients with a first-degree relative with lung cancer have a 50% increased risk of developing lung cancer . The effect is greatest in those with a sibling with lung cancer and is seen regardless of smoking status . Genome-wide association studies have shown that a major susceptibility locus on chromosome 6q (6q23-25p) is associated with increased lung cancer risk . Smoking increases the risk further . It is postulated that mutations in these genes influence lung cancer risk by increasing vulnerability to nicotine addiction . Targeting genetically high-risk individuals for intensive smoking cessation and screening programs may be the focus for future lung cancer prevention strategies . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with lung cancer risk . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is also associated with a sevenfold increase in lung cancer risk . A meta-analysis of diabetic patients has shown an increased lung cancer risk, especially in women . Previous malignancy . Lung cancer is frequently seen in survivors of previous malignancies, particularly other smoking-related malignancies . Patients who have had radiation therapy for thoracic malignancies (exempli gratia lymphomas) are at increased risk of lung cancer; smoking further increases the risk . Patients with HIV infection have consistently been shown to have increased rates of lung cancer and are diagnosed at an earlier age . A systematic review by the World Cancer Research Fund found 'probable' evidence that greater levels of fruit, and to a lesser extent vegetable consumption, are inversely associated with lung cancer risk . A recent Cochrane review found no evidence that vitamin D supplementation had any effect on lung cancer risk . There is only weak evidence to suggest that high physical activity can reduce the risk of lung cancer . The evidence for a protective effect of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) on lung cancer risk is inconsistent and limited to case control studies . In around 70% of cases, patients with lung cancer present to secondary care with symptomatic, advanced, incurable disease . Although mass screening of high-risk asymptomatic patients has the potential to detect disease at an earlier stage, randomized trials using chest X-ray (CXR) have not shown a reduction in lung-cancer mortality . Challenges to lung cancer screening are concerns over false positives, complications during diagnostic work-up, patient anxiety and screening cost . Advances in lung cancer screening are likely to involve refining the target population by identifying high-risk groups using risk prediction models such as the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP v2) risk model to identify people with a 5% or greater 5-year risk of developing lung cancer . Verified risk assessment tools (exempli gratia the Brock model) have been shown to be more accurate than clinician assessment at predicting risk of malignancy . For high-risk nodules (> 10% risk of malignancy) greater than 8 mm diameter (or 300 mm volume) a fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan can help assess risk of malignancy . High-risk nodules identified on PET should be considered for image-guided or excision biopsy depending on patient fitness and preference . Lower-risk nodules can be followed up with interval LDCT (see page 10) . ","Tobacco smoke exposure accounts for 90% of all lung cancers. Smoking prevention and cessation represents the major target for prevention of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The National Lung Screening Trial showed that low-dose CT screening of high-risk individuals reduced the risk of lung cancer-related mortality by 20%. The management of solitary pulmonary nodules is dependent on their risk stratification, evidence of growth on interval imaging (ideally using volumetric measurement) and patient comorbidities and choices."
9781910797471,ch09,"Between 30% and 50% of patients with acute HF are readmitted within 6 months, although 50% of these readmissions are due to comorbidities, often associated with advanced age, rather than existing HF . Prognosis of HF in individual patients is challenging as a number of independent variables must be considered, including symptoms, severity, etiology and type of HF . Outcomes are poor when the intensity of HF treatment is low and the patient does not adhere to the medications prescribed . Markers of poor prognosis . Initial assessment in patients with HF should include a review of the prognosis but, importantly, a search for reversible factors contributing to disease progression (Table 9.2) . If any of these problems are identified, prompt and comprehensive treatment should improve HF symptoms, in many cases arrest disease progression and improve prognosis . Palliative care in end-stage heart failure . Palliative care improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness . The quality of life of patients with advanced HF refractory to optimal pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies can be very poor and comparable with that of patients with terminal malignancies, with a case-fatality rate of 75% over 5 years overall . In practical terms advanced HF can be divided into three distinct stages . chronic disease management . terminal care . Chronic disease management strategies include education, monitoring, prevention and effective therapy (see earlier chapters) . They are used to prolong life, prevent HF hospitalization and provide symptomatic relief . Intervention should be delivered using the protocols of locally available HF management programs . Patients and their families (carers) should be fully informed about the nature of the disease including treatment and prognosis, with regular monitoring and appropriate review . Palliative and supportive care may begin following readmission to hospital with HF . A careful review of the patient's symptoms and all the available treatment options should be performed by the specialist in consultation with the patient's family practitioner and a palliative care specialist, using robust clinical identifiers of poor prognosis (Table 9.4) . If the patient assessment indicates the need for palliative care, management should shift to symptom control (Table 9.5) . Time should be set aside to discuss the prognosis, course of the illness and palliative-care strategies in detail with the patient and carer . A program of care individualized to the needs of the patient and their family is extremely important . Palliative-care strategies should build on, rather than replace, multidisciplinary programs of care that optimize advanced HF management . Properly applied, they can cut the overall cost of care by reducing the amount of time patients spend in acute-care settings . An advance care plan is often documented and the ways of managing future clinical deterioration discussed with the patient . Carers should be included in the management plans . Advanced health directive . Recognizing that the outcomes of resuscitation in patients with advanced HF are dismal, individuals should be empowered to express their treatment preferences even when unable to speak for themselves . The existence and process of obtaining such a legal document should be discussed with the patient and their carers early in the course of advanced HF . As the patient's condition deteriorates, the healthcare team should discuss any changes to the goals of medical therapy with the patient and family . This inevitably will include review of the current medical therapy and termination of non-essential drugs . Automatic implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) have become a common therapeutic option in suitable patients with severe HF . In these circumstances, the patient's quality of life should be paramount, and in many instances deactivation of the device may need to be discussed . To prepare patients and their families for such meetings, many physicians explore these issues at the time of implantation and continue to monitor the patient's status during follow-up visits . If progression to advanced HF becomes clear, it is suggested that discussion regarding deactivation of the ICD function should take place . Terminal care continues as the patient presents with intractable HF, with resting symptoms, poor appetite, weight loss, slow mental activity and low blood pressure with end-organ failure (exempli gratia kidney failure) . Therapy for symptom control should continue . The patient's resuscitation status should be reviewed with the patient and carer, and documented . ","Heart failure (HF) has a poor prognosis with an annual mortality of 25-50% depending on severity of symptoms and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Poor prognostic signs include impaired renal function, marked prolongation of QRS, hypotension and hyponatremia. The search for reversible factors is always indicated. The model of palliative care for advanced HF needs to be very flexible, individualized to the needs of the patient and their family. Good communication skills are the key to effective palliative care delivery. Primary care, cardiology and palliative care teams should work in collaboration to deliver an effective phase-specific treatment in advanced HF. End-of-life planning and decision making are essential and should be discussed early in the process."

It can also be added if the patient's acne has not improved significantly after 3-6 cycles of a contraceptive containing drospirenone . The dose can be increased if the patient has no significant breast tenderness or headache . Response in acne may take up to 3 months, as with other hormonal therapies . Lower doses can also be effective in acne . acnes within 4-8 weeks of starting treatment . Isotretinoin is indicated for patients with severe forms of acne such as nodular or conglobate acne, acne at risk of permanent scarring and moderate acne that is resistant to adequate courses of standard therapy with systemic antibacterials and topical therapy . European guidelines recommend isotretinoin as first-choice therapy for severe acne in both sexes . There are a variety of approaches to therapy with this drug . Longer treatment periods are sometimes required . Although these are usually mild, they can be severe and uncomfortable for the patient . The highest dose tolerated by the patient was then continued until the end of the treatment . At the end of an adequate course of treatment, acne will have cleared in 70-80% of patients, and in the remainder the acne is usually rendered much more sensitive to standard first-line treatments . Recurrence occurs in up to 45% of patients who stop treatment too early, particularly young patients and those who received a low dosage . The number of patients with moderate acne who are treated with isotretinoin because of an inadequate response to standard therapy has significantly increased in the past few years . By continuing treatment for at least 1 month after clearance, one study reported a comparable relapse rate to patients with severe acne receiving 120-150 mg/kg . Side effects . A negative pregnancy test must be obtained from female patients of childbearing potential 1 month before initiating therapy, monthly during therapy and 5 weeks after stopping therapy . Patients should be advised to use both a hormonal and barrier contraceptive . Pseudotumor cerebri is a potential rare side effect, which may occur in patients receiving oral isotretinoin . Other rare side effects of isotretinoin include headaches and fatigue . ","Systemic antibiotics remain useful therapy for inflammatory acne. Antibiotic-resistant Propionibacterium acnes is an emerging problem, and prescribing should take this important factor into account. Antiandrogen hormonal therapy may be helpful in female patients. Oral isotretinoin should be considered in patients with severe scarring acne and those who have relapsed or are not responding to conventional therapy. Oral isotretinoin is teratogenic; careful monitoring is mandatory. Mood changes, depression and suicidal ideation have been described in patients taking isotretinoin, but the drug has not been shown to be the cause; nevertheless, patients should be informed of the possibility."
9781908541796,chapter5,"The aggressive B-cell lymphomas (also known as high-grade B-cell lymphomas) include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (see page 80) . Treatment aims to provide a cure . Relapse is associated with a poor prognosis . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . Typically, the cells are large (Figure 5.1) and express B-cell markers . Importantly for treatment, most DLBCL express CD20, which is the target for rituximab . The most common finding is sheets of large cells, which stain with the B-cell markers CD19, CD79a and CD20 . Clinical presentation . Approximately 30% of patients have underlying indolent B-cell lymphomas . DLBCLs are aggressive, but approximately 50% are curable with combination chemotherapy . Management of DLBCL, as with all lymphomas, starts with staging (see Chapter 4) . Although outcome is partly dependent on the extent of disease at presentation, treatment is usually with combination chemotherapy, such as R-CHOP, regardless of clinical stage . Staging investigations include . low risk . low-intermediate risk . high-intermediate risk . high risk . The standard treatment for DLBCL is six courses of R-CHOP given every 21 days . However, the difference in high-risk patients was only of borderline significance (48% vs 39%; P=0.062) . Subsequent trials extended this observation to younger patients . Refractory disease . Treatment according to subtype . Patients with aggressive subtypes of DLBCL such as c-Myc -positive DLBCL, which has a high cell proliferation rate, tend to fare poorly with standard treatment compared with those who have c-Myc -negative disease . Patients who are in complete remission can be followed up in an outpatient clinic . Most centers see their patients every few months during the first 2 years when the chance of relapse is highest . Patients can probably be seen less often after 2 years provided they remain free of disease . Many centers now discharge patients after 5 years . Relapse or progressive disease . The prognosis for patients who relapse after treatment is generally poor, with only 20-30% of patients rescued with salvage/relapse protocols . Most patients destined to relapse will do so in the first 2 years after initial treatment . The following salvage/relapse regimens are used . CNS involvement is a rare but devastating complication of DLBCL . Patients with involvement of two or more extranodal sites together with a raised LDH are at particular risk of relapse in the CNS . or disease that involves the facial bones and surrounding structures . This area of lymphoma management is controversial, but most centers invoke some form of prophylaxis for patients thought to be at risk of CNS involvement . Burkitt lymphoma . It can often be cured with aggressive sequential chemotherapy . Burkitt lymphoma is probably the most aggressive tumor affecting humans . Every cell is undergoing cell division, leading to potentially devastating presentations with huge tumor burdens . Burkitt lymphoma associated with HIV . Clinical presentation . Many patients present with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, but the disease is almost always widespread and should be treated as such . Occasionally, patients will present with florid leukemia . The large tumor bulk often seen in these patients is reflected in very high levels of LDH in some cases . Burkitt lymphoma requires treatment with high-dose sequential chemotherapy . Effective treatment regimens expose the malignant and rapidly dividing cells to longer periods of chemotherapy than would be achieved with simple CHOP . Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma . Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma is a rare aggressive locally invasive lymphoma that presents in young adults and more commonly in women . Mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma presents a fairly distinct immunophenotype . Studies have found that primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma has a favorable outcome compared with DLBCL . ","The commonest aggressive B-cell lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Most DLBCL express CD20, which is the target for rituximab; approximately 50% of DLBCL are curable with R-CHOP. Patients who relapse require salvage chemotherapy and, if chemosensitive, will benefit from high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell rescue. Burkitt lymphoma and the c-Myc -positive DLBCL subtype have high proliferation rates and should be treated with sequential chemotherapy incorporating central nervous system prophylaxis."
9781910797150,ch02,"Types of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting . Five categories are used to classify CINV (Figure 2.1) . Nausea and vomiting may occur any time after the administration of chemotherapy, but the mechanisms appear different for CINV that occurs in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy compared with CINV that occurs 1-5 days after chemotherapy (Table 2.1) . Acute CINV is nausea and/or vomiting that occurs within the first 24 hours of chemotherapy administration . It can start within 1 or 2 hours of chemotherapy being administered and can last for several hours, with maximal intensity 5-6 hours after drug administration . The incidence (see page 19), severity and quantity of acute emesis and/or nausea varies depending on several treatment-related factors including the emetogenicity and dosage of the chemotherapy (see Chapter 4) and a number of patient-related factors (see Risk factors below) . Delayed CINV is arbitrarily defined as nausea and/or vomiting that develops more than 24 hours after chemotherapy administration . Delayed CINV is typically associated with the administration of cisplatin, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide and can occur days 2 to 7 after chemotherapy . It is more common in those who experience acute emesis/nausea . Other predictive factors include the dose and the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agent (see Chapter 4), patient sex and age, and protection against nausea and vomiting in previous cycles of chemotherapy . For cisplatin, which has been most extensively studied, delayed emesis reaches peak intensity 2-3 days after chemotherapy administration and can last up to a week if not treated . Breakthrough CINV is vomiting and/or nausea that occurs within 5 days of chemotherapy despite appropriate guideline-directed use of prophylactic antiemetic agents . This type of CINV usually requires immediate treatment or 'rescue' treatment with additional antiemetics . Refractory CINV is vomiting and/or nausea that occurs after chemotherapy in subsequent chemotherapy cycles when guideline-directed antiemetic prophylaxis and/or rescue treatment have failed in earlier cycles . Patients who experience CINV may develop a conditioned response known as anticipatory nausea and/or vomiting before the administration of chemotherapy in future chemotherapy cycles . This is attributed to the adverse memory of previous CINV . Incidence rates for this type of nausea and vomiting range from 10% to 45%, with nausea occurring more frequently . Anticipatory CINV can be triggered by a variety of tastes, odors, sights, thoughts or anxiety associated with the chemotherapy treatment . It is more challenging to control and treat than acute or delayed CINV . Risk factors . Risk factors for CINV include features of the treatment itself as well as a number of patient characteristics . Treatment risk factors . The potential for CINV may be influenced by the following features of the chemotherapy being administered . the emetogenicity of chemotherapy agents (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2, pages 54-7) . the doses of chemotherapy administered (see Table 4.3, page 59) . the combination of chemotherapy agents . Patient characteristics also influence the potential for CINV (Table 2.2) . These patients should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen available based on the international antiemetic guidelines (see Chapter 4) . Incidence in high-risk patients . Despite the use of guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics, CINV can occur with relatively high frequency in high-risk patients (20-25% acute, 50-70% delayed, 50% breakthrough and 30% refractory) . Patients who are scheduled to receive their first course of chemotherapy should be individually evaluated for their specific risk factors and prescribed appropriate antiemetics (see Chapter 7) . Treatment effectiveness . The use of antiemetic agents, as recommended by international guidelines, has been shown to prevent emesis in approximately 50-70% of patients receiving either highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy . The prevention of nausea has been much less successful with currently approved agents . New agents and new combinations of agents are necessary to adequately prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea . Although the onset and duration of symptoms usually points to chemotherapy as the cause, other potential aggravating factors that may cause nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer should be considered (Table 2.3) . ","The different types of CINV are classified according to the time interval at which nausea and vomiting occurs in relation to the administration of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy agents vary in their emetogenicity; for example, cisplatin has high emetogenic potential and causes CINV in almost all patients who do not receive antiemetic prophylaxis. Important individual patient characteristics contribute to the risk of developing CINV. Despite guideline-directed antiemetic prophylaxis, CINV can occur with relatively high frequency in high-risk patients (20-25% acute CINV, 50-70% delayed CINV, 50% breakthrough CINV and 30% refractory CINV). The guideline-directed use of antiemetic agents has been shown to prevent emesis in approximately 50-70% of patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The prevention of nausea has been much less successful with currently approved agents."
9781910797433,ch06,"Only those found to have stage I grade 1 disease after comprehensive staging are not considered for any adjuvant therapy . Patients with stage I grade 2 disease are sometimes excluded from adjuvant treatment, and the number of cycles prescribed is sometimes reduced in such cases . At least 6 cycles of chemotherapy are routinely recommended in patients with stage II disease and beyond (Figure 6.1) . Adjuvant approaches that are considered to be within current standards of care include . 'dose-dense' chemotherapy: a platinum agent administered intravenously every 3 weeks with a weekly taxane . weekly platinum plus taxane intravenous therapy . neoadjuvant chemotherapy . standard chemotherapy with the addition of bevacizumab . The choice of therapy depends on the physician, and is often tailored to the characteristics of the patient . The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is the current standard of care for first-line chemotherapy in ovarian cancer . Adjuvant versus neoadjuvant therapy . As shown in Figure 6.2, the first treatment decision for patients with ovarian cancer is the timing of surgery . The advantages of this approach include . removing the symptomatic tumor . avoiding the theoretical concern of possibly inducing resistant clones by exposing large-volume tumors to chemotherapy . However, other clinicians support the routine use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereby chemotherapy is started after the diagnosis is established by biopsy, and surgery is performed after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy have been administered . Two landmark Phase III trials have shown that interval cytoreduction after initial chemotherapy is a viable option in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer . The experimental group received platinum-based neoadjuvant therapy, followed by interval debulking surgery and subsequent adjuvant chemotherapy; the control group received primary debulking surgery followed by at least 6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy . The second study (CHORUS) assigned 276 patients to primary surgery and 274 to primary chemotherapy . Median OS was 22.6 months in the surgery group compared with 24.1 months in the chemotherapy group (HR for death 0·87 in favor of primary chemotherapy; 95% CI 0·72-1·05) . Grade 3/4 postoperative adverse events and deaths within 28 days of surgery were more common in the surgery group than in the chemotherapy group (adverse events: 24% versus 14%, p = 0.0007; deaths: 6% versus < 1%, p = 0·001) . The most common grade 3/4 postoperative adverse event in both groups was hemorrhage (3% versus 6% in the surgery and chemotherapy groups, respectively) . Overall, 49% of women receiving primary surgery and 40% of those receiving primary chemotherapy had a grade 3/4 chemotherapy-related adverse event, mostly uncomplicated neutropenia (20% and 16%, respectively) . The authors concluded that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not inferior to primary debulking surgery, and that administration of chemotherapy before surgery is an acceptable standard of care for women with advanced ovarian cancer . Choice of adjuvant therapy regimen . Dose-dense regimens . However, some investigators have explored a 'dose-dense' approach, whereby higher doses are administered over a shorter period of time . A large Phase III randomized trial showed superiority for this dose-dense approach using the weekly paclitaxel schedule . Neuropathy and hair loss were reduced in the dose-dense or weekly approach . More recently, the GOG262 study, which explored the dose-dense approach versus 3-weekly paclitaxel with the option of bevacizumab administration, showed no advantage in terms of PFS with dose-dense therapy; however, in a post hoc analysis of the group who opted not to receive bevacizumab (approximately 15% of the population), there was a statistically significant difference in PFS favoring dose-dense chemotherapy . Concomitant anti-angiogenesis treatment . Intraperitoneal chemotherapy . Increased toxicity is an important concern in patients receiving IP chemotherapy . patient characteristics (age, performance status, comorbidities, etc . Future trials exploring long-term efficacy and toxicity in addition to patient-reported outcomes, such as quality of life, are likely to further clarify the value of each regimen . In addition, future trials will examine novel combinations of targeted agents with traditional chemotherapy . ","Most patients with ovarian cancer present at advanced stages of disease, and thus require chemotherapy. The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is the standard of care for the front-line treatment of ovarian cancer. Options for adjuvant therapy include standard chemotherapy, dose-dense chemotherapy and intraperitoneal treatment. A key component in the choice of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy is the ability to cytoreduce, ideally to 'no gross residual tumor'. Women who have a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to less than 1 cm (ideally to no visible disease) should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among the current standards of care, the choice of therapy is generally based on a number of considerations, including patient characteristics, physician preference and regulatory status."
9781910797297,chp5,"Survival may also be worse with increasing age, which may reflect reduced innate immunity . Incidence also increases with age . Most patients with MF present with early-stage disease characterized by a long disease course but substantial morbidity (pain, pruritus, scaling), and cosmetic disfigurement may be considerable . Thirty percent of patients with MF and all those with Sézary syndrome (SS) present with advanced-stage disease, and in addition 25% with early MF will progress to advanced disease . Staging alongside identification of the good/poor prognostic factors will enable more aggressive subtypes that require more aggressive medical intervention to be identified and treated appropriately . The revised TNMB staging system . The Mycosis Fungoides Cooperative Group staging system was developed in the 1970s and was the preferred staging system for over 25 years . It provided prognostic information, but there were inconsistencies; for example, median survival in stage IIB was worse than that for stage III, and patients with folliculotropic patch/plaque (stage IB) MF had a worse prognosis than those with tumor-stage disease (stage IIB) . This revised staging introduced a blood classification (B0-2) alongside the conventional tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) categories . The TNMB system uses tumor (T1-4), nodal (N0-3), metastasis (M0-1) and blood (B0-2) classification to produce nine stages from IA-IVB and provides prognostic information (see Table 5.1) . Stages IA-IIA are considered early-stage disease and IIB-IVB advanced stage . Patients with early-stage disease tend to have a favorable prognosis of more than a decade and are managed with skin-directed therapy or a 'wait and see'/'expectant' approach . Patients with late-stage disease tend to have an aggressive clinical course and typically need systemic therapy . Cutaneous lymphomas other than MF/SS are classified separately using a TNM system; however, this staging system has not been validated prospectively for prognosis . 'Skin scoring' . The current T class does not reflect the skin tumor burden . A crude distinction between stage T1 and T2 disease is dependent on involvement of more than 10% of body surface area, while T4 is defined as more than 80% involvement . In T3 there is no minimum body surface area involvement and the presence of one tumor of more than 1 cm diameter defines disease . Use of the modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) provides additional information to staging in MF/SS . While there are always problems with any type of scoring system, the mSWAT score allows disease tumor burden to be accurately recorded to assess responses to treatment, and is useful in clinical trials . Patient survival according to stage of disease was reported in a recent London cohort of more than 1500 patients . Early-stage disease (IA-IIA) had a long median survival of 16-35 years and 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) of 89-98% (Table 5.2) . Signs in early-stage disease that indicated a better prognosis in this and other studies included presenting at a young age, poikiloderma, hypopigmentation and the association of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) . A large international multicenter study of 1275 patients with advanced-stage MF/SS reported survival of 63 months, with 2- and 5-year survival rates of 77% and 52%, respectively . The median overall survival for patients with stage IIB disease was 68 months; patients diagnosed with stage III disease had slightly better survival than patients with stage IIB disease, although patients diagnosed with stage IV disease had significantly worse survival (48 months for stage IVA and 33 months for stage IVB) . This study tested ten candidate prognostic markers (stage, age, sex, cutaneous histological features of folliculotropism, CD30 positivity, proliferation index, large cell transformation, white blood cell/lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and presence of identical T-cell clone in blood and skin) with the aim of developing a prognostic index that would identify advanced-stage patients at risk of progression . Four independent prognostic markers were found for worse survival: stage IV disease, age greater than 60 years, large cell transformation and increased LDH . This prognostic model may be used to stratify patients with advanced-stage disease who require more aggressive treatments . ","Mycosis fungoides (MF) can be categorized according to nine stages, from IA to IVB. Stages IA-IIA are considered early-stage disease and have a good prognosis, while stages IIB-IVB are advanced stage disease and progress rapidly. Early-stage lesions of the skin include patches and plaques. Advanced-stage skin lesions include tumors and erythroderma. Some patients with early-stage disease will have near-normal life expectancy, while advanced-stage survival is 1-4 years. Poor prognostic indicators for survival in MF include increasing age, raised lactate dehydrogenase, lymph node involvement and large cell transformation in the skin."
9781908541703,ch_6,"how far the tumor has spread . The goals of treatment can be to . achieve cure for the individual patient . Meta-analysis has clearly shown that local treatment does indeed affect distant control . For every four recurrences prevented locally at 5 years, one life is saved at 15 years, although this ratio is likely to be higher in low-risk patients . Local and systemic therapies are not necessarily used sequentially, but are mixed to maximize benefit and minimize risk according to the needs of the individual patient . Rationale for local treatment . Local treatment for breast cancer consists of surgery and radiotherapy, which aim to remove the cancer, stop its spread and reduce the likelihood of local recurrence within the breast, chest wall or axillary nodes . Primary surgery has long been the first treatment step . to reduce the size of the tumor before breast-conserving surgery in patients who are borderline for breast conservation . Surgical treatment of primary cancer . The aims of surgical treatment for primary breast cancer are to . achieve cure in patients in whom the disease is confined to the breast . try to stop any (further) metastatic spread from the primary tumor . The most commonly used mastectomy procedures are total mastectomy and axillary clearance . Simple mastectomy . Modified radical mastectomy . This allows easy removal of the axillary lymph nodes without greatly increasing the amount of tissue removed . Subcutaneous mastectomy . Skin-sparing mastectomy . Radiotherapy is not essential after such surgery unless there are other indications . Mastectomy is safe and most patients recover well . The most common complication after surgery is wound infection . With adjuvant radiotherapy, survival following conservative procedures is comparable with that achieved with mastectomy . tumor close to the nipple . more than one tumor . Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy . In this trial, all patients will receive whole breast radiotherapy . While excellent cosmetic outcome is an important objective of breast-conserving surgery, 'improving' breast shape should not be an objective during treatment of cancer unless the patient was already considering cosmetic surgery on the breast before she was diagnosed with cancer . Choice of operation should be discussed fully with the patient so that a considered decision can be made . Patient satisfaction appears to be similar with simple lumpectomy or therapeutic mammoplasty . Treatment of regional lymph nodes . Is axillary clearance necessary if only one or two sentinel nodes are positive? The Z-11 trial randomly allocated patients to receive either complete axillary clearance or no further surgery . Radiotherapy to intramammary nodes . It should be remembered that the technique has been tested mainly in patients with clinically negative axilla . The temptation to use the technique in every case should be avoided . When discussing axillary surgery with the patient, the following issues need to be discussed . Reconstructive surgery . Breast reconstruction following mastectomy is becoming increasingly popular, though currently only about 5% of patients undergo such surgery . The aims of reconstructive surgery are to . Notwithstanding these data, it is not inappropriate to discuss breast reconstruction with patients during discussions about mastectomy . silicone gel implants . Tissue expanders . Even in this situation, the safety of additional operations in breast cancer patients is not proven . Radiotherapy is considered mandatory for most patients undergoing conservative surgery, and is considered appropriate for women at high risk of recurrence after mastectomy with . a large primary tumor, particularly if the tumor is poorly differentiated . Radiotherapy provides highly effective local control, preventing local recurrence in more than 80% of those treated . This has prompted the 'faster radiotherapy for breast cancer patients' trial that is testing whether 1 week of therapy can be as good and without side effects . Targeted intraoperative radiotherapy is used immediately after local excision of early breast cancer . The first series that used TARGIT was started in 1998 and accrued 300 patients . These patients received TARGIT, as well as external-beam radiotherapy . It concluded that local control was non-inferior to conventional radiotherapy given over several weeks . Furthermore, the omission of whole breast radiotherapy did not increase axillary recurrence in this trial in which over 90% of cases had undergone sentinel node biopsy . ","Mastectomy and lumpectomy/wide local excision plus radiation are therapeutically equivalent for most women. Given adequate information, women can choose equally between mastectomy and breast conservation approaches. Breast reconstruction is viable and can be offered as an immediate or a delayed procedure. In the future, selected patients may be able to avoid the 3-6 weeks of conventional postoperative radiotherapy by receiving a single dose of intraoperative radiotherapy during lumpectomy."
9781908541727,ch02,"Red eye is one of the most common eye symptoms your patients will complain of . You must be able to recognize the severity of a red eye (that is, distinguish between a 'good' and 'bad' red eye), as outlined below . 'Bad' red eye . 'Bad' red eye is defined as one red eye (rarely bilateral) of unknown cause with one or more of the 'five Ps', as detailed in Table 2.1 . 'Good' red eye . 'Good' red eye is diagnosed when one or both eyes are red, but . both eyes are otherwise completely normal on examination . You can assess these patients for treatment yourself, or refer non-urgently to an ophthalmologist . However, you should refer any patient with 'good' red eye if the eye has not improved within 2 weeks, or if it turns into 'bad' red eye at any stage . Prescribing eye drops . There will be numerous occasions when you are challenged with a decision to treat a patient's eye condition with medication or to refer to an ophthalmologist . (It is difficult to make these decisions and monitor the eye condition without an ophthalmic slit-lamp . 'Safe' topical treatment . Don't ever prescribe the following eye drops . two 'good' red eyes . Diseases that present as 'bad' red eye . For the conditions described in this section, urgent treatment by an ophthalmologist can often save the patient's sight . Patients are usually young or middle-aged adults who present with one or more of: blurred vision (although vision can be normal early on), red eye (also mild in early cases), eye pain and photophobia . This disease can only be diagnosed by testing the eye's intraocular pressure with a tonometer . Do not confuse this condition with the more common chronic glaucoma, in which there is no eye redness or pain, the patient is almost always asymptomatic and eye pressure is usually below 30 mmHg (see Chapter 3) . There is usually eye pain or foreign body sensation; however, in herpetic dendritic ulcers the eye becomes numb (Figure 2.3), so even a large ulcer may not cause discomfort . Red eye, mildly or severely blurred vision, and photophobia are common . Scleritis is inflammation of the normally white sclera (eye wall) (Figure 2.5) . Patients complain of aching pain, which is often severe and can wake the patient at night . Vision can be normal or blurred . Endophthalmitis is a severe infection of the intraocular contents, which usually occurs within days or weeks of eye surgery . Diseases that present as 'good' red eye . Obviously it is never good to have a red eye, but the conditions listed below are annoying rather than dangerous . However, 'bad' red-eye diseases sometimes present like this early on, so it is important to follow these patients and refer them immediately if their condition persists or deteriorates . Bacterial conjunctivitis almost always affects both eyes, although it can be briefly unilateral . The eyes are red, gritty and sticky, with a pus-like discharge (Figure 2.7) . Warn the patient that the condition is contagious . Viral conjunctivitis is often caused by one of the common cold viruses, and patients often, but not always, have recently had a viral upper respiratory tract infection . Warn the patient that the infection is highly contagious until the redness has subsided . Warn the patient that they may need to use the drops for several weeks before they notice any improvement . However, subconjunctival hemorrhage is a benign condition that does not harm the eye . No treatment is necessary, but you will need to warn the patient that the condition could take weeks to resolve fully . This disorder is very common among elderly patients, and in younger patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . The eyes often look completely normal or are mildly red . Refer routinely if these lubricating treatments do not help . Blepharitis is chronic inflammation of the eyelids, which often causes secondary eye irritation, burning and foreign body sensation . The eyes themselves may look normal or slightly red . Patients with blepharitis also often have dry eyes, so prescribe lubricating eye drops as well . ","If a patient presents with a red eye of unknown cause, with one or more of the 'five Ps' (see page 22 ), they have a 'bad' red eye. Refer all patients with 'bad' red eye immediately and urgently - emergency treatment can often save the patient's sight. Do not prescribe any treatment for a 'bad' red eye. Underlying causes of 'bad' red eye include acute glaucoma, iritis, infective corneal ulcer, scleritis and endophthalmitis. If a patient presents with one or two red eyes, but without pain, photophobia or blurred vision, and the eyes are otherwise normal on examination, they have 'good' red eye/s. You can treat these patients yourself; however, they should be referred if they do not begin to improve within 2 weeks, or if their condition worsens. Underlying causes of 'good' red eye/s include bacterial, viral and allergic conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, episcleritis, dry eyes and blepharitis. The only eye drops you should prescribe without an ophthalmologist's opinion are artificial tears, antibiotics (for bacterial conjunctivitis) or mast-cell inhibitors (for allergic conjunctivitis). Do not prescribe steroid eye drops without advice from an ophthalmologist, as they can exacerbate infections, and cause cataracts and glaucoma."
9781910797273,chp6,"These treatments induce prolonged depletion of B-cell precursors, while sparing mature plasma cells . Their mechanism of action in multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown, but they may have an effect on B-cell trafficking into the central nervous system (CNS) and, indirectly, on T-cell responses . Rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have dramatically suppressed MRI activity in Phase II and III (ocrelizumab) studies compared with placebo . Three Phase III trials of ocrelizumab (Opera I and II and Oratorio) are complete and have confirmed its high efficacy in relapsing MS and new-found efficacy in primary progressive MS . To date, no safety concerns have emerged in the lower-dose MS trial populations, but trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus have been discontinued because of an excess of opportunistic infections and related deaths at higher doses . Despite promising results in Phase II trials in patients with relapsing remitting MS, a Phase II/III trial of rituximab in 439 people with primary progressive MS did not show efficacy . The trial investigators have suggested that better patient selection (exempli gratia younger patients with signs of inflammation in the brain) may improve outcomes . In addition, a Phase I/II trial of intrathecal rituximab in 27 people with secondary progressive MS was stopped early because of disappointing mid-trial results . Trials in MS are ongoing . The mechanism of action in MS is unknown, but a regulatory effect on the immune system, mediated by NK cells, has been postulated . A larger Phase III trial (DECIDE) has been completed in which daclizumab again demonstrated significant reduction of disease activity in relapsing remitting MS compared with interferon beta (IFNbeta)-1a: a 45% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with the comparator was reported in more than 1800 patients . A second Phase III trial is under way and will be completed in 2019 . Additional Phase III trials are under way to establish the efficacy of laquinimod and define a potential place for this agent in MS treatment . Stem cell therapy . The application of stem cell therapies to MS is perhaps more frequently raised by patients with the condition than their neurologists . However, both conventional (hematopoietic) and novel stem cell approaches (Table 6.1) offer potential new therapeutic avenues for MS, especially in patients whose disease is refractory to current disease-modifying treatments . The Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) study has shown the highest rate of NEDA (no evidence of disease activity) - 76% - in any trial to date, opening up the possibilities of changing the clinical course of MS . In Phase III randomized controlled trials of AHSCT, early studies in MS indicate a reduction in relapse rate of more than 90% compared with pretreatment levels of disease activity . The technique was reserved for patients with aggressive disease who had failed to respond to other treatments, and recent trials showed higher efficacy in patients earlier in their disease course . There is no evidence that immunoablative therapy will be efficacious in gradually progressive forms of MS . Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation . Although there have been only a few dozen patients in open-label studies so far, early data suggest that these cells may have an ameliorating effect on inflammation in patients with MS . Promoting repair has been an unexplored sphere of MS therapy . Initiated in 2013, the first multinational Phase II trial of anti-LINGO-1 antibodies in patients with acute optic neuritis has shown an effect on promoting nerve repair following optic neuritis . Ultimately, therapies that successfully promote remyelination and repair may be applicable across the spectrum of MS subtypes, including progressive forms of the disease . Mastinib has completed a positive Phase IIb study in patients with primary and secondary progressive MS, the results of which are reported to include improvement in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (see pages 54 -) . A Phase III trial in this population is now in progress, and it may prove to be an oral treatment option for this more rare type of MS . Multiple S1P receptor inhibitors are in Phase III development . S1P receptor products in Phase III studies include ponesimod, siponomod and ozanimod . ","A greater understanding of MS pathogenesis, from genetic susceptibilities and mechanisms of immune-mediated tissue injury through to the molecular basis of impaired tissue repair, has facilitated the development of new treatments for the disease. The spectrum of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) available to the MS clinician is expected to significantly expand over the next 5-10 years. Therapies being investigated include novel small-molecule immunomodulators, targeted immune-directed monoclonal antibodies, hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem-cell therapies, re-engineering of previous MS medications and molecules that promote remyelination and repair. Treatments such as autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be appropriate for the treatment of patients with highly active relapsing disease that has not responded to other DMTs, or as an inducing agent to 'reset' the course of MS. Laquinimod may have a novel mechanism of action that targets innate immune cells; it appears to affect disability progression and brain volume loss more than relapse rate. Anti-LINGO antibody is the first remyelination-promoting therapy to reach Phase II clinical trials in optic neuritis. Treatments that overcome molecular obstacles to remyelination may complement immune-directed therapies for MS in the future. Progressive MS may soon have a number of therapeutic options; the first is likely to be ocrelizumab. Ocrelizumab may soon receive FDA approval as the first DMT for progressive MS."
9781912776207,ch8,"This should, in turn, aid the development of novel precise mechanistic-based treatment strategies . Tissue-based molecular studies . NGS research studies have identified distinct mutational signatures in AITL and Tfh-related lymphomas, and recurrent mutations in other PTCL subtypes (see Chapter 2) . However, most studies have used targeted NGS or WES, providing only a limited view of the PTCL genome . Integrated multiomic analysis . The biology of PTCL is likely to extend beyond aberrations in the genetic sequence . The integration of sequencing data with multiomic analysis is likely to be critical in identifying vulnerabilities for drug targeting . Such analysis will be particularly relevant for PTCL cases in which current sequencing strategies do not detect a recurrent mutation . Challenges to molecular studies . Moreover, studies in other cancers have demonstrated significant intratumor heterogeneity, suggesting that single-site biopsies may fail to capture the global tumor mutational composition, representing a major barrier to genomic-driven treatment strategies . Blood-based sequencing assays . A potential solution to many of the challenges of tissue-based molecular studies is to use peripheral blood as a source of tumor DNA . Tumor DNA may be released into the circulation by dying cancer cells, or actively secreted . Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) offers a non-invasive way to determine tissue mutational status, assess global tumor heterogeneity and track tumor evolution in real time through serial sampling . The use of ctDNA in PTCL is being studied in several countries . Single cell analysis . Bulk analysis generates an average profile of the whole cell population, including malignant and non-malignant cells, which does not adequately capture the complexity of a tumor and risks missing treatment-resistant subclones that will ultimately germinate relapse . However, technological developments enabling single cell analysis are allowing researchers to deconvolute bulk tumors and analyze cancers with greater resolution and accuracy (Figure 8.1) . Single cell RNA and DNA sequencing can determine cancer evolution, provide insight into tumor heterogeneity and segregate and characterize stromal cells . Given that bulk sequencing of PTCL cases to date has been relatively insensitive, single cell analysis is likely to significantly advance our understanding of PTCL biology . Advances in the treatment of PTCL have been significantly hampered by the paucity of relevant preclinical models . Only a relatively small number of PTCL cell lines are available, many of which are poorly characterized and are of limited value to preclinical testing . There is also a lack of genetically engineered mouse models that faithfully reflect human PTCL . Recent initiatives generating patient-derived xenograft PTCL models may facilitate discoveries into PTCL biology and the development of novel treatment strategies . Novel treatment strategies . A plethora of new drugs are being developed, including monoclonal antibodies against T-cell receptors, cytokines, and chemokines, small molecular inhibitors that target key T-cell pathways, and agents that reverse epigenetic dysregulation . Disease rarity poses significant challenges, however . Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy represents a novel treatment strategy that may prove transformative across PTCL subtypes, as in other hematologic malignancies . Peripheral blood T cells apheresed from patients are engineered to express a modified antigen receptor that recognizes a cancer target (Figure 8.2) . Upon engagement with the target cell, activation of CAR T cells triggers cytotoxicity of the cancer cell . An alternative approach is to develop CAR products against the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRB) . Peripheral T cells express two isoforms, TCRB1 and TCRB2, broadly evenly, but PTCL is clonally either TCRB1 or TCRB2 . There is also uncertainty about tumor escape mechanisms . Current research in specific PTCL subtypes . A recent study has provided further support for two major biological and prognostic subgroups based on cell of origin: PTCL-GATA-3 and PTCL-TBX21 (see page 21) . Alternatively, PTCL-NOS can be divided from B cells and dendritic cells by microenvironmental signatures . The cell of origin has been identified as an intraepithelial innate lymphoid cell, a recently described heterogeneous immune subset . This insight is likely to precipitate further research and identify new drug targets . ","Next-generation sequencing has identified distinct DNA mutations in AITL and Tfh-related lymphomas, and recurrent mutations in other PTCL subtypes. Whole-genome studies should provide further insight across all PTCL subtypes. The integration of gene sequencing and multiomic analysis should help to identify vulnerabilities beyond aberrations of genetic sequences for drug targeting. The use of needle biopsies in patients with PTCL yield limits samples for molecular studies. However, circulating tumor DNA from peripheral blood may be an alternative. Patient-derived xenograft PTCL models may facilitate the development of new treatments and increase our understanding of PTCL biology. Given the high rates of chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes for most patients with PTCL, novel precision medicine strategies are needed. A plethora of new drugs is in development, including monoclonal antibodies against T-cell receptors, cytokines and chemokines, small-molecule inhibitors, and agents that reverse epigenetic dysregulation."
9781910797587,chp07,"Providing patients with information about osteoarthritis (OA) and its treatment is an essential first step . Rheumatology societies in most countries provide easy-to-read brochures or booklets on OA that can be given to patients at consultations . Some data suggest that both individualized education strategies and group education may improve patient symptoms . For example, patients who present with knee pain who have difficulty putting on shoes and socks, may have referred pain from the hip, and hip pathology should be considered . As might be expected, these programs have small effect sizes on physical outcomes, but moderate effects on psychosocial outcomes in OA . The benefits of exercise may be mediated through different routes, including increased strength and endurance, weight reduction, more accurate proprioception and joint position sense, improvement in comorbidities and reduction in anxiety or depression . Numerous studies have examined the benefits of exercise for OA of the knee and a few studies have assessed the benefits of exercise for OA of the hip . On balance, these studies show that therapeutic exercise brings about a moderate reduction in pain and some improvement in function, although the nature of the exercise differs between studies . It appears that benefits arise from individual programs and group classes and from exercises performed at home . Not surprisingly, the benefits of exercise may not be sustained for more than a few months if the exercises are not continued; it is therefore important to consider not only patient adherence but also the longer-term use of strategies such as an intermittent overview by a physical therapist to encourage ongoing exercise . Organizations such as the Arthritis Foundation in the USA and Arthritis Care in the UK provide a range of individual and group programs geared toward people with OA . Exercise for OA patients may take two main forms . Patients may not be able to undertake aerobic fitness training until they have sufficiently strengthened local muscles . A range of effective exercises is available to help reduce OA knee symptoms, including both strengthening exercises and aerobic walking . Such exercises should be tailored to the individual . It should be noted that patients with fixed-flexion deformities of the knee will have difficulties with exercises . One simple exercise for quadriceps strengthening is demonstrated in Figure 7.1 . The patient lies on a flat surface and bends up the non-exercising leg (to take some strain off the lower back and hips) . The knee to be exercised is extended fully and pushed down toward the bed or supporting surface . The patient can be asked to pull their toes back at the same time, which adds a hamstring stretch to this exercise . With the knee fully extended the patient then lifts the leg for a count of 10-20 seconds . For patients who are this weak, another helpful exercise may be walking laps in a swimming pool . This exercise may also be helpful for hip pain (due to true hip OA or trochanteric bursitis), where weak quadriceps will contribute to abnormal biomechanical load . walking laps in a swimming pool . cycling on an exercise bike, although this may be limited by the degree of patellofemoral disease . Recent work suggests that the combination of dietary weight loss and an exercise class can result in significant long-term reduction of pain and improvement in physical function in patients who are overweight . Other work suggests that barefoot mechanics (achieved through barefoot or thin-soled walking shoes) may improve joint loads in OA while thick, 'supportive' shoes may actually increase such loads, although the effects on OA symptoms at the knee or the foot have not been well investigated . A recent Cochrane review supports this view, concluding that there is inconclusive evidence for the benefits of bracing for pain, stiffness, function and quality of life in the treatment of patients with medial knee OA . A splint for the first carpometacarpal joint may be useful in patients who have OA at the base of the thumb . It is well documented that individuals with OA use large amounts of complementary (often over-the-counter) medications, with up to 40% of subjects reporting use in some studies . No good clinical trial evidence exists to support the use of these therapies for OA, and little is known of their potential toxicity . There remains significant controversy regarding the role of these medications in OA management . Many randomized controlled trials have compared glucosamine with placebo in patients with OA of the knee and/or hip . Despite many myths about the effects of diet on joints, there is no good evidence for any effects beyond those mediated by obesity . ","Education, self-management and exercise are important components of treatment. Muscle strengthening if weak and then aerobic exercises are the key to good management. Use of proper footwear, and weight reduction in overweight individuals, will reduce biomechanical loading of joints and improve symptoms. Use of aids such as a walking stick or devices to aid everyday activities (exempli gratia for opening jars) can also help symptoms and improve participation. The effects of many non-pharmacological therapies are difficult to discern because of differences in study designs and heterogeneous outcomes."
9781908541727,ch09,"Diseases of the eyelids are most commonly age-related abnormalities of eyelid position, or benign eyelid lumps . Rarely, however, serious disease can present as an eyelid abnormality . You can treat patients with the following conditions yourself, but refer them if the problem persists or worsens . Routine referral is appropriate for patients with other eyelid problems (exempli gratia ectropion) . Eyelid redness and swelling . It is essential to differentiate orbital cellulitis from preseptal cellulitis . By contrast, preseptal cellulitis is an infection in front of the orbital septum of the eyelid skin, and is harmless provided it does not progress to orbital cellulitis . Orbital cellulitis . A patient with eyelid redness and swelling plus one or more of the signs shown in Table 9.1 has orbital cellulitis (Figure 9.1) until proven otherwise . Patients with suspected orbital cellulitis require urgent admission for intravenous antibiotics (and sometimes surgery) . Preseptal cellulitis usually starts with an infected pimple or stye . Eyelid swelling (edema) without redness can occur in allergic reactions, anaphylactic reactions and nephrotic syndrome . Eyelid redness without swelling, in which the eyelid margins are red but without any marked eyelid swelling, is most commonly caused by chronic blepharitis (see pages 30 and -) . Abnormal eyelid position or function . Corrective surgery is possible . The lower lid hangs away from the eye and can cause chronic irritation and watering . Patients with ectropion should be referred routinely for corrective surgery . Entropion, in which the lower eyelid is turned in, is also usually due to age-related changes in the lid (Figure 9.5) . If severe, this can cause a corneal ulcer . Blepharospasm is an intermittent or constant eyelid spasm that results in too much eyelid closure . All these patients should see an ophthalmologist to rule out an ocular or neurological cause for the spasm . Many patients benefit from botulinum toxin injections to relax the contracting muscles . Skin rashes around the eye . The skin around the eyes is susceptible to most rashes that can occur elsewhere on the skin . A vesicular rash (often severe) appears on half the forehead and scalp; the rash sometimes affects the eyelids (Figure 9.7) . If the rash involves the tip of the nose, there is an increased incidence of eye involvement . Other periorbital rashes . Patients may develop contact allergic rashes to eye drops or makeup . Inflammatory lumps . It usually presents as a chronic, painless, non-tender nodule deep in the eyelid tissue (Figure 9.8) . On some occasions it may present as a red, tender swelling, especially if there is superadded infection . Chalazia are usually associated with blepharitis, which should also be treated . Do not prescribe antibiotic drops, ointment or tablets; these treatments will not work, as the lesion is not usually infected . External hordeolum is a hordeolum of hair follicles that usually has its leading edge pointing externally to the eyelid . The patient develops a tense, red, often painful swelling just inferior to the medial end of the lower eyelid (Figure 9.10) . It is the most common malignant eyelid tumor . Squamous cell carcinoma usually appears as a raised, red and scaly skin lesion, sometimes with central ulceration . It is the second most common malignant eyelid tumor but ten times less common than a BCC . Melanoma is usually a dark, flat or raised lid lesion, often with irregular margins (Figure 9.11b) . Inflammatory lumps usually have a fairly rapid onset, are usually red and/or tender, and may fluctuate in size over several days or weeks . Tumors, on the other hand, usually grow gradually and do not tend to be red or tender . Any type of skin tumor can develop in the eyelid skin; you should suspect a malignant tumor if a lid lump progressively enlarges, changes in appearance, causes loss of eyelashes or persists despite medical and even surgical intervention . ","Refer urgently (the same day), patients with one or more of:- acute unilateral or bilateral eyelid swelling with red eye and proptosis (possible orbital cellulitis)- any of the other signs of orbital cellulitis (see pages 79 - )- preseptal cellulitis in a child, or in an adult if it does not settle with the use of oral antibiotics- acute onset of unilateral or bilateral ptosis with double vision, unequal pupils, body muscle weakness or problems with breathing or swallowing (possible myasthenia gravis or partial third nerve palsy from aneurysm or tumor)- herpes zoster ophthalmicus (shingles around the eye)- new-onset seventh nerve palsy of any cause. Refer within 1 week, any patient with suspected eyelid skin cancer, or entropion with eyelashes abrading the cornea. - acute unilateral or bilateral eyelid swelling with red eye and proptosis (possible orbital cellulitis) - any of the other signs of orbital cellulitis (see pages 79 - ) - preseptal cellulitis in a child, or in an adult if it does not settle with the use of oral antibiotics - acute onset of unilateral or bilateral ptosis with double vision, unequal pupils, body muscle weakness or problems with breathing or swallowing (possible myasthenia gravis or partial third nerve palsy from aneurysm or tumor) - herpes zoster ophthalmicus (shingles around the eye) - new-onset seventh nerve palsy of any cause."
9781912776153,chp3,"In all of these situations, syncope is usually of considerable concern to the patient and may result in sequelae such as injury, restriction of driving, or even death . What is syncope? . Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness), and presyncope is defined as a sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness but do not actually do so) . Patients often use the term 'dizzy spell', which covers a multitude of etiologies, including vertigo and postural symptoms; a detailed history of what the patient actually feels is mandatory . Features that may help to clarify if blackout has a cardiac cause are detailed in Table 3.1 . Patients are usually lucid quickly after an episode . Syncope is much more common than epilepsy . Recurrent presyncope (the sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness) is common and may culminate in syncope over time . In some cases, symptoms may occur over many years before a diagnosis is made . Syncope in patients with known structural heart disease, particularly impaired left ventricular (LV) function, carries a significantly worse prognosis with an increased risk of sudden death . Syncope may be due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or intermittent advanced heart block . These patients require urgent cardiological investigation . Patients with cardiac syncope often do not remember the loss of consciousness and therefore only consider that they have had a fall . Further investigations will help to ascertain whether the blackout has a cardiac cause . Clinical history . The clinical history remains of critical importance . The patient, and others present at the time of the syncope, can provide important details about the circumstances of the syncope . the time of day of the syncope . whether syncope occurred at rest or during exertion . whether syncope occurred following micturition . whether the patient had any symptoms preceding the syncope, such as palpitations, dizziness, sweating, or an aura . whether the fainting episode occurred suddenly or gradually . whether the patient injured themselves at the time of syncope . Non-invasive testing . Cardiac monitoring at the time of syncope remains critical to exclude or confirm a cardiac arrhythmia . However, in the majority of circumstances there was no monitoring of the rhythm at the time of syncope, and there are no tracings available to review . Thus, the work-up of the patient who has had an episode of syncope is initially directed at determining if there are any cardiac abnormalities . The positive yield of monitoring will depend upon the frequency of syncopal episodes . Newer smartphone and smartwatch applications will ultimately provide new means for patients to record their heart rhythm at nearly all times . Tilt-testing is now infrequently performed in the evaluation of syncope, and is mostly performed in centers evaluating patients with profound autonomic causes of syncope . Syncope associated with advanced heart block requires permanent pacing, and remains a worldwide daily presentation in the physician's office or in the emergency room . For patients with neurological causes of syncope, whether vascular or due to a seizure, the neurologist will plan for appropriate treatment . In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, id est the common faint or vasovagal syncope, a frequent clinical problem, treatment and prevention of syncope can be challenging and frustrating . Nowadays, permanent pacing is performed infrequently but still has a therapeutic role in subsets of patients with syncope . Pharmacological approaches include the use of drugs to treat hypotension, such as midrodine directed at vasodepressor syncope or anticholinergic agents directed at cardioinhibitory syncope . There have been reports of performing cardiac ablation of ganglionated plexuses in these patients to avoid permanent pacing and reduce or eliminate recurrent episodes of syncope by reducing cholinergic tone . Table 3.4 details which patients should be referred and how urgently . Take a detailed history of the circumstances of the episode from the patient and, if possible, from a witness . Determine whether there were prodromal symptoms such as nausea, sweating or lightheadedness suggestive of vagally mediated syncope . Determine whether there are any associated cardiac abnormalities . ","Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness or TLoC). Syncope can be benign, such as vasovagal (neurocardiogenic), although it may still be disabling for some patients with recurrent fainting spells. Syncope can also be serious with a potentially fatal outcome, such as ventricular arrhythmias or heart block. Recurrent presyncope (the sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness) is common and may culminate in syncope over time. Syncope in patients with known structural heart disease, particularly impaired left ventricular function, carries a significantly worse prognosis with an increased risk of sudden death. The differential diagnosis is complicated by the fact that patients with cardiac syncope often do not remember the loss of consciousness and therefore only consider that they have had a fall. Always try to find a witness to the incident. Instances of sudden unheralded blackout without prodromal symptoms and with brief loss of consciousness are almost certainly cardiac in origin. Syncope with or without palpitations requires prompt referral."
9781908541680,ch_7,"For our ancestors, physical activity was a vital element of life, for hunting and to avoid being hunted . Leisure time is also more high-tech and sedentary . An estimated 75% of adults get less physical activity than they should . One study showed that 56% of men and 52% of women believed they were sufficiently active to benefit health, whereas only 36% and 24%, respectively, achieved even moderate activity . Even when metabolically normal, obese subjects tend to be at increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases . Physical activity must be reintroduced to our lives - by scheduled exercise for those who enjoy and can maintain it, or by increasing the amount and quality of activity during the daily routine, or ideally both . Risks of inactivity . Inactivity, for example prolonged sitting, carries a risk irrespective of bodyweight . Benefits of physical activity . Physical activity is an integral and essential part of any long-term weight management program . improves fitness decreases cardiometabolic risk . helps sustain weight loss maintains weight after initial 5-10% loss . A study carried out among Boston policemen showed minimal difference in weight loss with diet alone compared with diet plus exercise, but the group that exercised sustained weight loss in the long term . It is difficult to lose weight by physical activity alone but exercise reduces the adverse effects of overweight and obesity even if weight is not lost (Table 6.1) . Increasing physical activity is as beneficial to general health as giving up smoking . Maximum benefits come from a combination of resistance and aerobic activity . The waist circumference of someone who becomes fitter by increasing levels of activity will decrease, although their weight may change little . Encouraging patients who exercise . Individuals who attempt weight loss by physical activity alone should be congratulated on increased fitness, and should be encouraged to monitor their waist circumference; otherwise they may become frustrated and demoralized by lack of change in weight or body mass index (BMI) . Recommended levels . While many country-specific recommendations exist, the World Health Organization recommends 45-60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on most days to prevent unhealthy weight gain, and 60-90 minutes per day to lose weight or prevent weight regain after substantial loss . At least 10000 steps per day (as monitored on a pedometer) are recommended for health, and 15000 to lose weight or maintain weight loss . Extra activity can be undertaken at home, in the gym, park, sports field or shopping center, as long as it is additional activity, preferably enjoyable, and likely to be maintained in the long term to avoid rebound weight gain . Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, people who wish to improve their personal fitness further, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by doing more than the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity . Reducing sedentary behavior and increasing incidental activity . Individuals with sedentary occupations should ensure that periods of sitting are broken at least every 30 minutes by at least standing for an equivalent or even greater period of time and where possible some form of activity for a brief period . Desks that allow people to stand and work, or even walk and work are available and such behaviors confer health benefits . Strategies to increase incidental activity are shown in Table 6.2 . Individual tailoring . It is important to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual, setting realistic goals . Any increase in activity level, however small, is important, and induces an almost immediate improvement in insulin sensitivity . Long-term medical conditions may affect a person's ability to achieve meaningful levels of activity, and appropriate advice must take this into account . The US Surgeon General's report recommends wheeling oneself in a wheelchair for 40 minutes as being a reasonable level of activity for health benefits, whereas a patient with lower-limb orthopedic problems may be advised to perform low-impact activities, or even arm exercises alone . Elderly patients often suffer from low muscle mass (sarcopenia), so increased physical activity of any degree and particularly with a resistance component should be vigorously promoted for anyone with severe physical limitations . Gortmaker calculated that the risk of overweight is increased 4.6 times in children who watch more than 5 hours of television per day . The UK National Audit Office has produced some recommendations to prevent childhood obesity . at least 2 hours' physical activity a week for all pupils . broadening the range of activities schools offer to encourage young people to participate in different forms of physical recreation . ","Physical activity is a key component of weight management and is important for maintaining weight lost by any method of treatment. Physical activity is beneficial regardless of weight loss, as it reduces cardiometabolic risk, insulin resistance and cancer risk. Although the amount of weight loss induced by exercise alone may be disappointing, there are beneficial changes in fat distribution and body composition. An increase in physical activity can be achieved by modifications to the daily routine; multiple short bouts are just as beneficial as the equivalent amount of activity performed in one session. Some aerobic activity that leads to shortness of breath each day provides additional benefit, and some resistance exercise should also be included."
9781910797693,chp7,"There are several considerations when prescribing a biosimilar . The name of drug to be dispensed - to enable tracing of the drug used by a patient in the event of an adverse drug reaction (ADR), for example, it is important to know the brand name and batch number . Differences in the available administration devices and relevant patient support . Available doses and presentation packs . Switching a patient's medication . The term switching is used in this context to mean changing a patient's treatment at the clinical level, so the decision by the clinician - in discussion with the patient- to prescribe a biosimilar in place of the originator biologic . (This contrasts with substitution, which occurs at pharmacy level; see page 65 . The concept of switching a patient from one brand of a drug on which they have been established to another brand of the same drug is crucial to biosimilar usage . The demonstration of comparability with the originator biological provides clinicians with the confidence to switch a patient to a biosimilar . In one published study of patients receiving growth hormone, 98 patients from a cohort of 130 were switched from an originator brand to a biosimilar; 15 reported non-serious adverse drug reactions (mainly injection site discomfort) . The term 'interchangeable' has different meanings in Europe and the USA in the context of biosimilars, with the potential to cause confusion . In Europe, 'interchangeable' is a scientific and medical term that means changing one medicine for another that is expected to achieve the same clinical effect in a given clinical setting and in any patient, on the initiative, or with the agreement of, the prescriber . However, it is not a legal term . In the USA, by contrast, 'interchangeable' is a strictly legal term for a subclass of biosimilar drugs that have been approved for automatic substitution by a pharmacist without the agreement of a clinician (and included in the FDA 'Purple Book') . For this reason, the EMA cannot determine how changing between reference medicine and biosimilars is achieved . These will be the same drugs already approved through the standard biosimilars pathway but supported by post-approval clinical data which demonstrates that switching does not compromise safety or efficacy . Product drift over time means that no biologic drug can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . Switching from a reference drug to a biosimilar is argued to carry a risk to the patient in that introducing a new version of the drug that may have differences in tertiary structure could affect efficacy or safety, including concerns about immunogenicity . However, the counter-argument is that this will happen anyway: if the patient remains on the same brand, variation will occur . Naming biosimilar medicines on prescriptions . Biosimilars, like small molecule generic drugs, share the same international non-proprietary name (INN) as the reference drug . This is because, as the EMA says, a biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the same active substance . However since biosimilars are not yet approved as suitable for automatic substitution at a pharmacy level, using the INN alone for prescribing will be insufficient . In some countries, the prescriber may have to specify that the drug may not be substituted at pharmacy level . Rules on counterfeit drugs also require the batch number to be recorded . Thus, if patients are switched to a new injection device, the potential for patient error or poor adherence should be managed . Generic drugs are usually considered so similar that most nations with well-resourced and technically competent regulators permit substitution by pharmacists, without the intervention of the prescribing clinician . In the context of biological/biosimilar drugs, the term substitution similarly refers to the dispensing of a different biosimilar product from the brand prescribed by the clinician . However, NHS England states that it is inappropriate to automatically substitute biologics at pharmacy level (id est to dispense a product other than the one prescribed) . Given that the originator biologic and biosimilar share the same INN, clinicians are advised to use brand names when prescribing biologics/biosimilars, in order to limit the risk of automatic substitution at the pharmacy level . Within the EU, legal restrictions have been developed to prevent automatic substitution . Patient information . It is good practice to keep patients informed of treatment changes . Authoritative information about biosimilars for patients is available from the European Commission in seven languages, which can may be adapted if national equivalents are not yet available . ","Patients may be started on a biosimilar or switched from an originator biologic. The decision to prescribe a biosimilar in place of a biologic is a clinical one, and has long been practiced with the epoetins and recombinant growth hormone. The demonstration of compatibility with the originator biological provides clinicians with the confidence to switch to a biosimilar. Switching does not require any dosage modification, although patients may need to be taught how to use a new injection device. The prescription should state the brand name and international non-proprietary name of the biologic or biosimilar, and in some countries the prescriber must indicate that substitution is not permitted. Substitution of a biologic with a biosimilar at pharmacy level is not permitted in the EU. The batch number must also be recorded. Clinicians' concerns that switching risks problems with immunogenicity are unfounded; indeed, numerous medicines agencies have concluded that biosimilars licensed in the EU are interchangeable and that switching would not be expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. Furthermore, microheterogeneity in the originator biologic means that a patient is exposed to slightly different molecules over the course of treatment."
9783318066241,ch7,"Pathogenesis and natural history of infected pancreatic necrosis . Bacterial DNA has been isolated in blood from almost 20% of patients with AP . Viable bacteria may colonize pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrotic tissue, leading to infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) . Together with the development of persistent OF, IPN is the most serious complication of AP . Symptomatic collections: clinical manifestations and diagnosis . Symptomatic collections can be divided into symptomatic sterile collections and infected collections . As acute peripancreatic fluid collections are usually sterile (they very rarely become infected), the term IPN is used here to refer to infected collections . Symptoms due to collections usually begin in the late phase of AP (beyond the first week after disease onset) . Infected pancreatic necrosis is rare in the first week after disease onset . According to a cohort study, the median time to diagnosis of IPN was 26 days after disease onset . IPN should be suspected in cases of necrotic collections associated with new-onset SIRS or OF after the first week from disease onset, or if pre-existing SIRS or OF fail to improve after the first week . In this clinical scenario, if other possible sources of infection are ruled out, IPN is present in approximately 80% of patients . Gas in peripancreatic collections on imaging (Figure 7.4) strongly suggests IPN, and has been described in 42% of patients undergoing intervention for suspected infection . A definitive diagnosis of IPN requires a positive Gram stain or culture of the necrotic tissue obtained through fine-needle aspiration (FNA), minimally invasive drainage or surgery . Drainage of symptomatic collections . The management of symptomatic collections is summarized in Figure 7.5 . Indications for drainage . Generally speaking, sterile symptomatic collections can be managed conservatively . Only 1 in 10 patients or fewer with sterile necrotic collections require drainage due to symptoms, compared with almost all patients with IPN (see Table 7.1) . The method for draining the collection, once the decision is taken, is similar to that for IPN (see Figure 7.5) . Now, minimally invasive methods for drainage are available, so obtaining a definitive diagnosis is less important . The ESGE guidelines recommend against routine percutaneous FNA in patients with suspected IPN, stating that its use should be restricted to cases with a suspicion of infection but with unclear clinical/imaging signs . In most cases direct drainage for diagnosis and treatment is encouraged when IPN is suspected and other sources of infection (central-line infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, Clostridium difficile infection, etc . Timing of drainage . Invasive treatment during the first 4 weeks of disease should be avoided if possible . Percutaneous drainage would be the treatment of choice during the first 4 weeks after disease onset, but should be used only in unstable patients (exempli gratia those with uncontrolled sepsis) . All other patients should wait until the collection is mature before drainage is attempted . Drainage techniques . Open necrosectomy . Two large-bore surgical drains are placed in the collection via the incision and the skin is closed between the drains . Evidence-based selection of drainage technique . Before 2010, the standard treatment of necrotic collections (all IPNs and those symptomatic collections refractory to conservative treatment) was open necrosectomy . In 2010, the group published a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a step-up approach versus open necrosectomy for patients with IPN . The step-up approach comprised a first step of percutaneous or endoscopic transgastric drainage . If there was no clinical improvement after 72 hours and if the position of the drain (or drains) was inadequate or other fluid collections could be drained, a second drainage procedure was performed . In the trial, 88 patients with IPN were randomized to either the step-up approach or to open necrosectomy . The step-up approach was associated with lower rates of . In addition, 40% of patients who received the step-up approach avoided surgery altogether . Currently, therefore, the endoscopic step-up approach seems to be the first-choice method for drainage . Choice of stent for endoscopic drainage . ","Symptomatic collections can be divided into symptomatic sterile collections and infected collections. Bulky sterile collections may become symptomatic or clinically relevant because of pain and/or compression of adjacent structures. Infected pancreatic/peripancreatic necrosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Sterile symptomatic collections are mostly managed non-invasively. Drainage is indicated in infected collections or in symptomatic sterile collections that persist despite initial conservative treatment. Currently, initial endoscopic drainage (plus/or percutaneous drainage in collections distant from the digestive tract) followed if needed by endoscopic necrosectomy seems the treatment of choice to drain collections. Video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement is a good alternative to endoscopic necrosectomy. Open necrosectomy should be avoided if possible."
9781908541796,chapter2,"Any cancer can be considered as a process characterized by unregulated cell division, cell growth and impaired cellular maturation . This does not mean it is hereditary, but rather is due to the accumulation of a number of acquired genetic changes that cause the transformation of a normal cell into a malignant cell . The genetic changes result in either over- or underexpression of the genes involved . The unmutated form of an oncogene found in normal cells is called a proto-oncogene . Tumor suppressor genes . When these genes are functioning, they prevent malignant transformation . The two copies of the tumor suppressor gene may be inactivated by different processes . Molecular mechanisms altering gene function in lymphomas . This silencing of a suppressor gene results in upregulation of cell signaling and subsequent uncontrolled activation of the cell cycle . This would promote cancer formation in the affected cell . There are two types of lymphocyte . The T lymphocyte (or T cell), which has the T-cell receptor (TCR) as its antigen receptor . IgM and IgD are produced by B cells before they have encountered antigen, whereas after antigen exposure the immunoglobulin can switch to any of the classes mentioned above . Each lymphoma arises from a single abnormal lymphocyte . Genetic changes within the lymphocyte lead to an accumulation of cells, every one of which has arisen from a single cell (a clonal population) . Different types of lymphoma are thought to exist as a result of genetic changes in lymphocytes at different stages of their life cycle . Lymphocyte life cycle . Both B and T lymphocytes arise from a common lymphoid progenitor cell in the bone marrow . B-cell development occurs in two stages . antigen independent . antigen dependent . The earliest recognizable cell in the B-cell lineage is called the pro-B cell . This matures to produce the pre-B cell, which expresses immunoglobulin internally within the cytoplasm (along with a receptor on the surface called the pre-B-cell receptor) . This in turn develops into the immature B cell, which expresses intact immunoglobulin (IgM or IgD) on the surface of the cell . B cells then travel via the bloodstream to the spleen where they undergo further development (in the form of transitional B cells) to result in mature (though still antigen naive) B cells . There are two forms of mature B cell: the follicular B cell and the marginal zone B cell . Marginal zone B cells mostly exist at the spleen and mucosal sites . Within the germinal center, specialized follicular dendritic cells present the foreign antigen of the invading microorganism to B cells (Figure 2.3); if the B cells recognize the foreign antigen they are rescued from cell death by the intervention of T cells, allowing a population of B cells to survive that are capable of recognizing foreign organisms and producing antibodies that attack them . Two molecular events take place during this phase . Mutations that result in a lower affinity immunoglobulin molecule lead to cell death by apoptosis . Class switch recombination switches the class of immunoglobulin expressed by the cell, thereby changing the effector functions the antibody is capable of mediating . Most B cells that enter the germinal center die by apoptosis . T-cell maturation occurs in the other primary lymphoid organ, the thymus . The formation of a TCR is analogous to that of an immunoglobulin molecule in a B cell . Mature T cells can be broadly classified into two types . cytotoxic T cells, which, as their name suggests, can kill cells infected with microorganisms . The two cell types can be recognized by the presence of a specific molecule on their cell surface: helper T cells express CD4 whereas cytotoxic T cells express CD8 . Normal lymph-node architecture . Primary follicles are composed of resting B cells . This is the structure in which antigen is presented to B cells by follicular dendritic cells; the B cells then either proliferate or die by apoptosis, depending on the affinity of their immunoglobulin receptor for the antigen (see page 19) . Secondary follicles also have a mantle zone composed of resting B cells that have not yet encountered antigen . Alongside the cortex lies the paracortex, which is predominantly composed of T cells . ","Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. Lymphocytes are formed in an antigen-independent stage in the bone marrow (and thymus for T cells) but need an encounter with antigen in secondary lymphoid tissue to develop further. The different types of lymphoma probably arise from different stages of the lymphocyte life cycle. Lymphomas arise because of several complex genetic changes involving activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes."
9781910797662,ch08,"Principles of immunotherapy . Tumor cells express antigens that provide variable levels of distinction from normal tissues . These antigens are taken up and processed by antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells . Processed antigen is then presented to cells of the immune system, including T and B cells . The immune system recognizes and responds to these antigens, particularly through the development of cytotoxic T cell antigen-specific responses and development of immunologic memory . Cytotoxic effector T cells migrate to the site of the cancer and attack cells expressing the antigen . These processes evolved to facilitate recognition of intracellular pathogens such as viruses, and the immune system uses the same processes to recognize and eliminate tumor cells . Many tumor cells are eliminated before clinical evidence of cancer emerges, and some tumors live in equilibrium with the immune system until another event disturbs this equilibrium in one direction or the other . However, tumor cells adapt and evolve through natural selection to evade the immune system . Our growing understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying immune processes has led to new approaches to manipulation of the responses . The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis has also been a key target, described in more detail below . However, not every tumor type responds, and not every patient with a potentially responsive cancer will benefit . PD-1 axis . Clinical development in bladder cancer is currently focusing on agents that interfere with the PD-1 axis, particularly the PD-1 receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) . PD-1 is a cell surface 'checkpoint' that has an important role in regulating the recruitment and activation of T cells . Overexpression of this receptor by tumor cells has been reported in several solid tumors, including bladder cancer . Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 receptor affects the immune response to cancer cells in two ways . In the lymph nodes, overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor-infiltrating immune cells can prevent the priming and activation of new cytotoxic T cells, and subsequently prevent recruitment of these immune cells to the tumor . Within the tumor microenvironment, up-regulation of PD-L1 on dendritic cells leads to deactivation of cytotoxic T cells . Blockade of the PD-1 axis removes the inhibition of effector T cells, promoting cellular cytotoxicity (Figure 8.3) . Expression of PD-1 is low in non-cancerous tissue so the effects of PD-1 are largely confined to the tumor site . Furthermore, therapies that act on PD-1 have the potential to reset tumor-related alterations in the immune system while leaving normal peripheral tolerance to self-antigens unaffected . PD-1-targeted immunotherapies . Occasionally patients demonstrate remarkable responses, which can be prolonged . Responses cannot be reliably predicted using existing tissue-based assays of PD-L1 or other available markers . Prediction of response . The identification of biomarkers, and therefore tests, that predict response to treatment has not been a priority in pharmaceutical drug development . The FDA simultaneously approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells to help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with atezolizumab . However, the subsequent Phase III IMvigor 211 study did not confirm these findings . Variation in PD-L1 expression . Importantly, PD-L1 expression is both dynamic and sporadic: it probably changes over short periods, and PD-L1 is not necessarily expressed by all cells . Tissue PD-L1 expression has reasonable positive predictive value, in that cancers that are positive for PD-L1 expression are generally more likely to respond to PD-1-targeted therapies . However, cancers that do not appear to express PD-L1 may still respond to therapies targeted at the PD-1 axis . First-line studies . This approval was based on data from a cohort of 119 patients in the IMvigor 210 trial . The Keynote-052 Phase II trial examined the activity of pembrolizumab as first-line treatment in 'cisplatin-ineligible' patients . Pembrolizumab may be a reasonable alternative for first-line therapy in less-fit and cisplatin-ineligible patients . Adverse effects of immunotherapy . ","Five immunotherapies have recently been approved for the second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, and two have also been approved in the first-line setting. There is good evidence that second-line treatment after cisplatin-based chemotherapy is generally well tolerated, efficacious, and can confer a survival advantage. First-line treatment is also efficacious, particularly in patients less likely to tolerate cytotoxic chemotherapy. So far there is no strong evidence that immunotherapies targeted at the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis differ substantially in terms of efficacy or toxicity. A survival benefit has been shown with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy but not atezolizumab (likely a reflection of the study design); however, survival data from the trials of the other immunotherapies are not yet mature. Combination strategies are being explored; these may be more active than monotherapies but are likely to be more toxic and more costly. Current tissue-based programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) assays do not reliably predict response or lack of response to PD-1-targeted therapy. The management of advanced and metastatic bladder cancer will evolve as the results of further trials emerge."
9781908541178,ch_7,"Therapeutic choices depend on both the chronicity and severity of the pain being treated . The first 4 weeks of acute low back pain are generally managed by the primary care physician . For a few patients with a painful radiculopathy not adequately relieved by RICE treatment, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may provide some measure of pain control . Depending on the patient's pain tolerance, the choice of medication becomes the next, and for severe pain the most urgent, therapeutic decision . Although a few patients may request no medication, for almost all patients appropriate analgesic medication is the first priority . Opioids are not uncommonly needed for short-term pain control, and intermittently (on an as-required basis) for patients with subacute low back pain . The decision to administer opioid analgesia to patients with chronic pain is more complex . Chemically induced pain with inflammation tends to be more persistent and less position-dependent than mechanically provoked pain . Oral corticosteroids have the greatest benefit in those with radicular leg pain . Muscle relaxants can also be effective for chronic low back pain when muscle tightness limits motion . Because psychological factors influence a patient's ability to cope with pain, effective pain relief should not only address the physical discomfort of low back pain, but also the psychopathology and pain-related psychological stress . Psychiatric and skilled pain management assistance is often indicated for patients with intractable pain . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not usually helpful in controlling low back pain, except in patients with both low back pain and unipolar or bipolar depressive mood disorders . the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire . Bending, twisting and lifting are the most common activities that precipitate low back strain and pain . Back first, back flat, back straight, back last . Some of the maneuvers that are performed most often during the day can impose strains on the back and exacerbate pain . Similarly, sitting down requires the patient to stand with the back of the legs in contact with the chair . Stocking-donner devices can also help to minimize bending, twisting and pain . therapeutic exercises are beneficial for chronic, subacute and postsurgical low back pain . continuation of normal activities is the only intervention with benefits for acute low back pain . It is widely used for treatment of a variety of musculoskeletal disorders, including low back pain . It was not possible to fully control for all confounding factors, and the outcome did not support a benefit for TENS treatment in chronic low back pain . TENS can be used by an individual with chronic low back pain to return to work . Under the patient's control, it can be used as needed to decrease pain while in the work setting . v) or patient education . Six treatments over a 2-week period are usually sufficient to determine if acupuncture can provide any pain control for an individual patient . As with all low back pain therapies, however, there are both strong advocates and disappointed consumers of acupuncture treatment . Therapeutic exercises . For the patient in pain, those exercises that can offer some relief and progressively restore, or at least maintain, function are therapeutic . Williams flexion exercises have for many years been the gold standard of exercises for low back pain patients . For most low back pain patients, they remain a good, basic conditioning exercise program . The role of the abdominal muscles in providing back support during lifting activities is still controversial, and for many patients attempting to do a sit-up exercise can be painfully difficult . McKenzie back extension exercises . After shift correction, the patient performs the back extension exercises which are intended to help maintain the centralized disc . Back-reconditioning exercises are part of a multidisciplinary treatment program for chronic low back pain . Exercises are graded depending on the level of pain, and the patient is cautioned to stop if any of them cause pain . Sample programs for patients with moderate pain or mild pain are given in Tables 4.4 and 4.5, and Figures 4.8 - 4.24 . Other forms of back-reconditioning exercises, such as core stability exercises, can also be useful . Another useful set of exercises are shown Chapter 7, Back maintenance exercises . A broad spectrum of therapeutic options is available for the treatment of low back pain . In all phases of low back pain management, the patient must be given the responsibility and the tools to self-manage the disorder independently . ","Pain management during the acute first 4-week phase of low back pain should consist of RICE (rest, ice, corset/brace, exercise) unless 'red flags' are present. No X-ray or laboratory investigation is indicated unless 'red flags' are present. Treatment will depend on assessment of pain severity (severe, moderate, mild, minimal). Multidisciplinary treatment should be strongly considered in chronic pain management. Medications during the acute phase can include paracetamol (acetaminophen), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants. Short-term opioids for severe pain can also be considered. The visual analog scale (VAS) for measuring pain is very helpful. Bed rest is rarely indicated, but restful postures and ergonomic considerations to promote comfortable ambulatory activities should be encouraged. Graduated and progressive home reconditioning along with pain control measures is indicated. Spinal manipulation once or twice weekly for up to 4 weeks may be helpful for acute low back pain. Evidence for the benefits of manipulation for chronic low back pain is lacking. Acupuncture may be helpful. A trial of six to eight treatments should help determine acupuncture efficacy. Corsets are of equivocal benefit for acute pain management and should be limited in their use."
9781912776726,ch6,"IDH inhibitors . It is also being evaluated for the treatment of several IDH1 -mutant solid tumors, including glioma . Phase I data in 35 patients with non-enhancing glioma (grade II and III tumors) have shown ivosidenib to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities . While the 6- and 12-month PFS rates with ivosidenib were 32.0% and 21.9%, respectively, none of the patients who received placebo were progression free for 6 months or more at data cut-off . The selective BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib has been investigated in a multicohort study that included 24 patients with glioma, including six with glioblastoma . All had received temozolomide and two had received bevacizumab . In patients with malignant diffuse glioma, the best response was a partial response; five patients had stable disease, which persisted for more than 1 year in two patients . Immune checkpoint inhibitors . Immune checkpoint inhibitors bind to and inhibit these molecules so that T cells can once again identify and attack cancer cells . Promising data reported with immune checkpoint inhibitors in other cancers have prompted their evaluation in glioblastoma . Patients received a presurgical dose of nivolumab, followed by postsurgical nivolumab . No obvious clinical benefit was substantiated following salvage surgery, but two of the three patients treated with nivolumab before and after primary surgery remained alive 28 and 33 months later (median overall survival [OS] is approximately 15 months) . However, a recent Phase III study (CheckMate-498) of nivolumab with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with MGMT -unmethylated glioblastoma failed to meet its primary endpoint of improving OS . It may be that the timing of immunotherapy administration is an important factor when treating glioblastoma, or that there is a select population of patients that derive benefit, which is, as yet, unidentified . Other immunotherapies . Proteosome inhibitors . Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to exert anti-tumor activity, including reducing glioblastoma cell viability . Following its successful assessment in Phase I trials in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, marizomib is now being investigated in a multicenter randomized controlled open-label Phase III superiority trial . The study aims to enrol 750 patients . The primary objective is to compare OS in patients receiving marizomib in addition to standard of care (temozolomide/radiotherapy, followed by temozolomide) with patients receiving standard treatment only . The study is accompanied by a translational research program . Patient enrolment started in June 2018 (clinical trial information: NCT03345095) . The vaccine contains the patient's own dendritic cells, pulsed with the patient's tumor lysate or peptides (obtained during surgical resection) . Once the vaccine has been administered back to the patient, intradermally or subcutaneously, it activates T cells to cross the blood-brain barrier and target glioblastoma cells . Vaccination-related side effects include redness and itching at the site of injection . An autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine is being trialed across 80 centers in four countries in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma . All enrolled patients underwent surgery and standard of care chemoradiotherapy (see page 47) before receiving the vaccine (n > 232) or placebo (n > 99) . The optimal timing of vaccination has yet to be determined, but it is thought that vaccination at the same time as treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy may increase the chemosensitivity of the tumor . Tumor-treating fields . The study included 695 patients with glioblastoma that had been resected or biopsied and who had completed radiochemotherapy . Gene therapy . Patients are then treated with the oral compound veledimex, 20 mg, in capsule form, which activates IL-12 production . In patients who also received low-dose steroids (>= 20 mg dexamethasone), the median OS was 17.8 months versus 6.4 months in patients who received high-dose steroids (< 20 mg dexamethasone) . ","Novel therapeutic management approaches for patients with glioblastoma are needed, but the selective targeting of oncogenic mutations that has transformed the therapeutic landscape in other cancers has yet to be exploited in the treatment of glioblastoma. The need to penetrate the blood-brain barrier is a complicating factor. Ivosidenib, a small-molecule IDH inhibitor, vemurafenib, an inhibitor of BRAF V600E, and marizomib, a pan-proteosome inhibitor, are currently in early trials in patients with brain tumors. Dendritic cell immunotherapy is emerging as a promising addition to the multimodal treatment of glioblastoma. The final survival results of a large Phase III trial are awaited. The use of drug-induced interleukin-12 gene therapy is currently being evaluated in patients undergoing resection for recurrent high-grade glioma."
9781908541406,ch_7,"This can be achieved by inhibiting the activity of plasmin by aprotinin, or tPA by tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) . Tranexamic acid and EACA are synthetic lysine-containing amino acids . They have recently been found to reduce bleeding following trauma or surgery in a wide range of clinical settings . Tranexamic acid and . Also, dose adjustment is required in patients with moderate or severe renal failure . In the absence of a structural lesion in the uterus, tranexamic acid may reduce menstrual loss because fibrinolytic activity is high in the endometrium . If these fail, or are contraindicated, oral tranexamic acid, 1 g three times daily, can reduce bleeding by 30-50% if taken during the first few days of menstruation . The stomach lining has a high concentration of fibrinolytic enzymes and there is some evidence that tranexamic acid reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeding . Bleeding in the urinary tract . This fibrinolytic activity in urine, however, tends to exacerbate any tendency to bleed, such as after prostatectomy or if a bladder polyp is present . In these circumstances, tranexamic acid inhibits urokinase and can reduce bleeding from the bladder . To avoid this complication, the bladder can be irrigated and then tranexamic acid or EACA instilled to provide local inhibition of fibrinolysis . Trauma-induced bleeding . The Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH)-2 study demonstrated that if tranexamic acid was given to bleeding trauma victims blood loss was reduced and there was a 1.5% reduction in mortality . As a result of this very large study, tranexamic acid should be considered for all major trauma patients . Fibrinolytic inhibitors reduce bleeding and the consequent need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing complicated cardiac surgery . There is evidence of benefit in a wide range of other elective surgical procedures traditionally associated with bleeding, including spinal fusion and total knee replacement surgery . Enthusiasm is tempered, however, by the risk of thrombosis, especially in patients with a history of myocardial infarction or stroke . Tranexamic acid or EACA may also be used to help prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia who require minor surgery . Bleeding disorders . In most patients with congenital (exempli gratia hemophilia) or acquired bleeding disorders, the appropriate way to manage bleeding or potential bleeding (exempli gratia after surgery) is to raise the plasma level of the deficient clotting factor . Tranexamic acid has a well-defined role in patients with bleeding disorders after dental extraction; it should be given orally in a dose of 15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 10 days and can also be used as a mouthwash (50 mg/mL) in the immediate postoperative period . Previously it had a place in cardiac surgery, where it was of proven benefit in reducing blood loss . However, recent studies have demonstrated that a proportion of patients develop severe renal failure following its use . By raising the level of these clotting factors desmopressin is particularly useful for treating patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease, especially when therapeutic levels are only required for a short period (Figure 5.2) . For example, to cover dental surgery or other minor surgery the level of the deficient factor need only be raised to about 50% normal for 4-6 hours . Further doses can be given after 4-6 hours, but the response is usually diminished (tachyphylaxis) . It is important to note that desmopressin also releases tPA; therefore, the concomitant administration of tranexamic acid or EACA is often considered . Desmopressin also has a place in the treatment of other congenital bleeding disorders (exempli gratia platelet storage pool disorder) and some acquired conditions (exempli gratia renal failure; see Chapter 9) . Desmopressin should be used with caution . Desmopressin should not be given to patients with clinical evidence of atherosclerosis because of the risk of thrombosis when raising the VWF/FVIII levels . Their effectiveness is variable, depending on the extent and location of the wound and the intensity of bleeding . ","Tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) are useful for the management of hemorrhage following trauma and surgery in many different clinical settings. Tranexamic acid or EACA should not be given to patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or those who may be bleeding from the upper urinary tract. Desmopressin will often provide effective hemostatic therapy in mild hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease and some platelet disorders. A fibrinolytic inhibitor may be given concomitantly to inhibit the activity of the released tissue plasminogen activator. The antidiuretic effect of desmopressin lasts for 24 hours and can lead to clinically significant water retention and hyponatremia. It should not be given to those with atherosclerosis because of the risk of precipitating a thrombosis. Topical agents provide local hemostasis, but those that contain animal proteins or are prepared from human blood convey risks of antibody formation and infection transmission."

A systematic review of RCTs suggests that while antidepressants reduce the severity of chronic back pain, they do not improve functional status . Untreated depression reduces the positive effect of all back pain treatments . Invasive treatment .

Osteoporosis produces chronic pain due to fractures . For patients with acute or chronic pain, the treatment of pain and functional limitations should be the first priority . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatment for mild to moderate pain secondary to a stable fracture . If pain persists, an opioid should be added . Non-pharmacological treatment . Vertebroplasty has recently been introduced for treatment of patients with osteoporosis who have acute or chronic pain following vertebral fracture .

Exercise reduces pain and disability in patients with osteoarthritis of the hip or knee . The role of acupuncture for the treatment of osteoarthritis is not clear . Pain due to rheumatoid arthritis . Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by joint pain and inflammation that may progress to joint destruction . Meta-analysis of RCTs has confirmed that NSAIDs are effective in decreasing pain and the number of tender joints, and improving function in rheumatoid arthritis . Systematic reviews of RCTs that have evaluated SAARDs have confirmed their effectiveness in reducing pain intensity and decreasing the number of painful and swollen joints . Non-pharmacological treatment . Education and behavioral therapies . A systematic review of the literature has concluded that patient education is effective in reducing pain and improving function in rheumatoid arthritis . Acupuncture has not been found to be of use for the treatment of pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis . ","When the etiology of low back pain is apparent, it is most often a musculoskeletal abnormality of the lumbar spine; however, low back pain may also be referred from visceral pathology. Chronic low back pain is a complex biopsychosocial process that cannot be explained on purely anatomic, biomechanical, neurophysiological, immunologic, inflammatory or neurochemical grounds. Symptomatic therapy can be initiated without imaging tests in adults under 50 who lack 'red flags' - history of major trauma, cancer, or signs or symptoms of systemic disease, tumor, immunocompromise, fracture, abscess, progressive and severe neurological loss, or cauda equina syndrome. For patients over 50 and those whose findings suggest systemic disease, plain radiography and simple laboratory tests can almost completely rule out underlying systemic disease. CT or MRI should be reserved for patients over 50 and those with 'red flags' (see above). Exercise has moderate utility in the prevention or treatment of chronic back pain. Pregabalin has small to modest analgesic efficacy. Massage, spinal manipulation and acupuncture provide small-to-moderate short-term benefits. There is insufficient evidence to support the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of chronic low back pain, particularly in light of the increased risks for gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events. Epidural steroid injections produce small-to-moderate short-term pain relief. Antidepressants reduce pain severity but do not improve function. Integrated treatments that address the salient biopsychosocial factors perpetuating disability appear to have the best chance of returning disabled persons to a functional quality of life."
9781908541468,ch_7,"Hypertension is the most common chronic disease in the Western world; by the age of 60 years, over 50% of the population will have developed high blood pressure (see . Fast Facts: Hypertension) . Hypertension is even more common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); by the time patients develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), over 80% have elevated blood pressure, and hypertension accounts for approximately 20% of all cases of kidney failure . After the age of 60 years, most of the population either has hypertension or is at risk of developing it . Hypertension associated with parenchymal kidney disease represents a potent vicious cycle; it is both a consequence of CKD and a cause of progressive kidney damage . Evidence from many studies shows that treatment of hypertension is crucial to slowing progression of renal disease, particularly among those with significant albuminuria (> 1 g/24 hours) . Since hypertension is a common chronic condition, the evaluation and treatment of comorbidities associated with hypertension should be an integral part of management . Blood pressure should be measured using the correct size of cuff, with the patient at rest in the correct position, either seated or supine (see Fast Facts: Hypertension) . In most patients, urine protein measurement is a useful indicator of kidney involvement . In patients with CKD, treating hypertension is important in slowing disease progression and in reducing cardiovascular risk . In patients with ESKD, the focus should be directed towards reducing cardiovascular morbidity . Patients with albuminuric CKD (> 500 mg albumin/24 hours) require aggressive management of blood pressure, with a target of less than 130/80 mmHg . In young women with hypertension of recent onset, fibromuscular renal artery disease should be excluded . Patients unlikely to have a positive response (and perhaps all patients) should receive aggressive medical therapy to control blood pressure, together with statins and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) . Hypertensive emergencies are situations in which an immediate reduction in blood pressure is required in order to prevent or treat acute, progressive, target-organ damage . Diabetic nephropathy . Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of ESKD in Europe and the USA . Its prevalence is increasing as patients with diabetes are living longer and the complications of diabetes are better controlled . ESKD secondary to diabetes mellitus is seen in 45% of patients in the USA, compared with 15% in the UK . Patients with early disease have incipient nephropathy and without specific interventions may progress to overt or clinical albuminuria over a period of 2-10 years . Most patients will also develop hypertension, which initially manifests as the absence of a nocturnal dip in blood pressure, but later becomes sustained hypertension . The mortality of patients with diabetic nephropathy is higher than in other patients because of a four- to eightfold increase in the rate of cardiovascular complications . Type 2 diabetes . All patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened for incipient or established diabetic nephropathy, because microalbuminuria is present at diagnosis in approximately 25% of patients . Type 1 diabetes . Apart from glycemic control, the other major factor determining progression through diabetic nephropathy is hypertension . Prevention and treatment . Aggressive intervention in patients with either incipient or established nephropathy has been shown unequivocally to prevent progression of renal disease . Overwhelming evidence implicates hypertension as a major risk factor in the progression of diabetic nephropathy . Hypertension usually appears during the microalbuminuric phase of disease, although in type 2 diabetes it may result from other causes, such as renovascular disease . Both systolic and diastolic hypertension accelerate the progression of diabetic nephropathy . Aggressive management of hypertension reduces the progression of diabetic renal disease . Angiotensin blockade should be the first-line therapy, but most patients will require multiple drugs . Many studies have shown that in diabetic (and non-diabetic) patients with kidney disease, angiotensin blockade can reduce the level of albuminuria and the rate of progression of renal disease to a greater degree than other antihypertensive agents . As a high proportion of patients progress from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy and subsequently to ESKD, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are recommended for all patients with microalbuminuria . ","Hypertension is both an important cause and a consequence of renal disease. Blood pressure targets are less than 130/80 mmHg or lower in the presence of albuminuria (> 500 mg/day) and less than 140/90 mmHg in the absence of albuminuria. Pregnant women with significant renal impairment are likely to have hypertension, pre-eclampsia and premature labor. For optimal renal protection in patients with chronic kidney disease, angiotensin blockade with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is recommended. Medications, particularly antihypertensive agents, require careful review in pregnant women with renal disease. The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is microalbuminuria, which can be tested by an increased albumin:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample (> 2.5 mg/mol in men or 3.5 mg/mol in women). All patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened for incipient or established diabetic nephropathy, as microalbuminuria is present in about 25% of patients at diagnosis. Microalbuminuria is rarely present at diagnosis in type 1 diabetes; these patients should therefore be screened at the onset of puberty or 5 years after diagnosis, then annually. The major risk factor for development of diabetic nephropathy is hyperglycemia. Aggressive intervention in patients with incipient or established nephropathy unequivocally prevents progression of renal disease. Treatment strategies for diabetic nephropathy include aggressive glycemic control, angiotensin blockade, blood pressure control, protein restriction and smoking cessation."
9781910797426,ch02,"The signs and symptoms of pancreaticobiliary diseases are usually non-specific . It is usually intense and steady . It may be gradual and associated with anorexia and weight loss . Pruritus is the unpleasant sensation of itching associated with biliary obstruction . The physical examination is complex and dependent on the suspected diagnosis . An abdominal exam is important as it may reveal palpable masses in the right upper quadrant, or an enlarged gallbladder, due to obstruction by stones or a tumor . Multiple tests with variable sensitivity and specificity are used for the differential diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary diseases . These can highlight a possible cause for suspected biliary or pancreatic diseases . As the signs and symptoms of pancreaticobiliary diseases are non-specific, imaging is key to the diagnosis and management of patients . Imaging can clarify the presence and site of obstruction, as well as a possible cause in patients with cholestasis . Transabdominal ultrasound provides morphological information of the gallbladder, as well as the intra- and extrahepatic biliary tracts and pancreas . The accuracy for gallbladder diseases (especially for gallstones) reaches close to 100% but the technique is examiner dependent . Transabdominal ultrasound is used in patients with obstructive jaundice to show the level of obstruction (dilated intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts) and the possible cause; nonetheless, the specificity is quite low for the differential diagnosis of stones in the common bile duct (CBD) compared with cholangiocarcinomas or pancreatic tumors larger than 2 cm . Computed tomography and CT cholangiography can be used in patients with intra- or extrahepatic obstruction, although their accuracy in determining the cause of obstruction seems to be lower than for other imaging tests . Multidetector helical CT and MRI are the methods of choice for the initial cross-sectional examination of the pancreas, including the evaluation of acute and chronic pancreatitis and early detection and staging of pancreatic tumors . MRI is an exciting but expensive method that is useful for identification of pancreaticobiliary tumors . For some indications, such as evaluation of pancreatic cystic tumors, some clinicians prefer MRI because of its improved accuracy and detection of pancreatic cysts . MRI has the added advantage over CT of not exposing patients to ionizing radiation; however, due to claustrophobia, MRI is not possible in a number of patients and EUS has to be used instead . MRI can be supported with MRCP sequences that allow for high-accuracy examination of the bile ducts and pancreatic duct for diagnosis of stones and tumor masses . MRCP has replaced endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) as a diagnostic method and is also used as a screening method for the selection of patients that require therapeutic ERCP . EUS can detect CBD or gallbladder stones (microlithiasis) and therefore offers useful information in patients with suspected acute biliary pancreatitis or acute idiopathic pancreatitis . Detection of CBD stones using EUS is high (95%) compared with MRCP, thus avoiding invasive procedures and aiding the selection of patients for therapeutic ERCP . EUS has at least a similar accuracy with MRCP in the detection of CBD tumors and allows EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), which is followed by cytological or microhistological examination of the sampled material . Furthermore, EUS enables early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and the assessment of patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis by combining the evaluation of parenchymal and ductal criteria such as stones, duct dilation and/or the presence of pseudocysts . EUS has a higher sensitivity than other imaging modalities and facilitates the diagnosis of small pancreatic masses less than 2 cm . In addition, tissue diagnosis by EUS-FNA gives this type of imaging a distinct advantage over other cross-sectional methods . In experienced hands EUS is also used for therapeutic indications in pancreaticobiliary diseases . This makes both diagnosis and therapy of pancreaticobiliary diseases possible in one procedure . The method is used in selected patients with either retained stones or unclear stenoses suspected of malignancy . Bile leaking and bleeding are complications seen in up to 10% of patients . The method is now entirely used for therapeutic purposes since other less invasive and risky imaging modalities can be used for diagnostic purposes . ","The symptoms and signs of pancreaticobiliary diseases are usually non-specific. Imaging tests with varied diagnostic performance, technical success, complications and cost efficacy are used to confirm the presence, location and possible cause of pancreaticobiliary diseases."
9781910797105,ch03,"The development of agreed, reliable definitions of the diagnosis has been crucial to epidemiological research . Since the late 1990s, how we think about the geographic distribution of schizophrenia has changed . How common, how global? . The incidence of schizophrenia is the number of new cases, expressed either annually or as lifetime risk . The prevalence of schizophrenia is the total number of cases, either at a particular point in time (point prevalence) or over a particular period (exempli gratia lifetime prevalence) . Incidence studies of epidemiological samples show that there are approximately two new cases of ICD schizophrenia, or approximately one new case of DSM schizophrenia, per 10000 population each year . Schizophrenia exists in all cultures in all countries . Until relatively recently, it was believed that incidence rates were similar around the globe, based on results from large-scale studies carried out by the World Health Organization . A fivefold difference in incidence rates around the globe is now known to exist, with higher rates in developed countries than in developing countries . The incidence of schizophrenia is slightly more common in men, with a male:female ratio of 1.4:1 . Men are also more likely than women to develop enduring negative symptoms . Season of birth has been found to correlate with the development of schizophrenia: a well-replicated finding is that people who develop schizophrenia are about 8% more likely than the general population to have been born in late winter or early spring (January to March in the northern hemisphere; July to September in the southern hemisphere) . An alternative explanation is an alteration in the normal seasonal pattern of conceptions (slightly higher in summer) in parents carrying a schizophrenia gene . It has been recognized since the 1990s that rates of psychosis are higher in ethnic minority groups . In the UK and Europe, rates of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are higher in several ethnic groups, particularly black people from Africa and the Caribbean . Overall, global studies have shown that rates of schizophrenia in all migrant groups are twice those found in native populations . City life and schizophrenia . It has long been known that rates of schizophrenia are higher in urban than in rural areas . Early surveys seemed to show that this was due to the drift of people into urban areas after the illness started, rather than to higher rates of new cases in cities . However, large studies have confirmed that new cases arise more commonly in cities, with the rates being proportional to the degree of urbanization . This appears to be an unexpectedly large effect . The relative risk for large-city dwellers compared with that for rural residents is only two- to threefold (see Table 5.2, page 44) but, because much of the population lives in cities, the proportion of schizophrenia that can be explained by this factor is about one-third . Being brought up in a city appears to be the critical factor, and the risk increases the more childhood years spent in an urban environment . The factors associated with city life that lead to this higher incidence remain to be clarified . The data suggest that those with a genetic vulnerability are most at risk of the effects of urban upbringing . Course, outcome and mortality . The best-designed outcome studies are those that prospectively follow a cohort of consecutive first-episode patients, ideally from a defined geographic area, for at least 5 years . However, such studies are rare . Clues to long-term outcome can be gleaned from demographic factors and from the pattern of the first episode . Mortality in people with schizophrenia is increased threefold, and life expectancy is reduced by about 15 years, compared with the general population . This effect can be partially attributed to a tenfold increase in suicide rates: young men in the first 3 years of their illness are most at risk . However, much of the increased mortality is due to the deleterious effect of poor diet, obesity, smoking and lack of exercise, all of which are more common among the population with schizophrenia . Longitudinal studies of isolated, subclinical psychotic experiences show incidence and prevalence rates of about 3% and 8%, respectively, which are 10-100 times higher than the rates for full psychotic disorders . The peak age of onset is in adolescence and the symptoms are transient in most cases . One school of thought is that these experiences represent part of the phenotype of schizophrenia or at least psychosis (Figure 3.3), and that a proportion of these individuals may progress to 'prodromal' symptoms, as described in Chapter 12 (pages 110 -), and of these a further proportion will develop schizophrenia . ","The incidence of new cases of schizophrenia is 1-2 per 10000 population per year. The condition exists in all countries and cultures, but incidence and prevalence rates vary markedly. Rates are higher in ethnic minority groups. Onset is usually in early adult life; 20% will recover completely. Urban environments in childhood appear unexpectedly important in causing schizophrenia. Life expectancy in people with schizophrenia is 15 years less than the general population, mainly because of increased cardiometabolic disease."
9781908541994,ch01,"Acne (acne vulgaris) can affect all age groups, including neonates, infants, prepubescent children, adolescents and mature adults . However, the disease is most prevalent and most severe in adolescents; it is present to some degree in 85% of all teenagers . Once regarded as a transient disease of puberty, acne now starts earlier and lasts longer (Figure 1.1) . The earlier onset of acne mirrors an earlier average age of puberty, but the reasons for persistent acne are not clear . Pre-adolescent acne . Acne before the onset of puberty is not common . Descriptive terms used for acne in pre-adolescent children are generally based on age; a recent classification of acne in children based on expert consensus included five subtypes according to age: neonatal, infantile, mid-childhood, pre-adolescent and adolescent . However, the distinction between pre-adolescence and adolescence by age can be challenging, so the term prepubertal acne is frequently used . In addition, defining acne by age does not necessarily identify children that are at risk of treatable forms of virilization . Neonatal acne may present at birth or shortly afterwards, up to 28 days . Neonatal acne usually settles spontaneously and leaves little in the way of scars . This disorder usually presents in the first 3 weeks of life; the prevalence in newborns, as described in the literature, varies considerably from 10% to 66% . Comedonal lesions are not usually seen . It has been postulated that NCP develops in association with Malassezia sympodialis and M . NCP does not normally require treatment as it is a self-limiting disorder that usually heals without scarring in 1-3 months . Infantile acne is seen more rarely than neonatal acne but is often misdiagnosed . Infantile acne typically presents after 6 months . Most cases resolve by the age of 5 years but occasionally some lesions remain as a continuum until puberty . A history of a sibling with infantile acne may be notable, and a family history of severe acne is not uncommon . Patients with infantile acne may develop a resurgence of their acne as teenagers, and parents should be advised accordingly . The central cheeks are frequently affected, and lesions embrace a combination of inflamed papules/pustules with open and closed comedones . The presentation is usually more widespread than neonatal acne . A study of 29 patients with infantile/juvenile acne seen in a specialist center over 25 years demonstrated a median age of onset of 9 months; the disease was mild in 24%, moderate in 62% and severe in 14% . The acne was predominantly inflammatory in 59% . Five patients (17%) were left with scarring . Acne conglobata (see pages 24-5) can present in infants, resulting in severe inflammatory cystic lesions, sinus tract formation and significant scarring . Mid-childhood acne presents between the ages of 1 and 7 years . Acne developing within this age range should always raise the suspicion of androgen excess and the need for further investigation . Prepubertal acne usually presents with comedonal lesions with or without some inflammatory papules . Lesions are frequently located in a mid-facial distribution and may precede any other signs of maturation . The development of acne in childhood along with premature adrenarche may be an initial sign of polycystic ovary syndrome or metabolic syndrome . Acne occurs earlier in females than males, reaching peak severity in females at about 17 years, compared with 19 or 20 years in males . Moderate to severe acne was present in 24% of boys and 11% of girls . Adult female acne is seen more commonly in dermatology clinics than adult male acne . Although acne is a universal condition, studies suggest a link between geographic environment and prevalence, with an intrinsically lower prevalence in people living in rural locations than those living in urban environments . Acne in patients over 40 years of age may be a product of modern urban lifestyles . Affected sites . The first site to be affected is usually the face, but later the trunk is significantly involved in about 30% of patients . In some patients, acne may be localized to one site such as the chin or forehead, or upper part of the back or chest; in others, all sites are equally affected . Examples of facial acne can be found in Chapter 3 . ","Acne (acne vulgaris) typically occurs around adolescence. Acne can present in the neonate, and may persist beyond adolescence in susceptible individuals. Patients with infantile acne may experience resurgence at puberty. Midfacial comedones in prepubertal acne correlate with relatively worse prognosis. There may be a link between geographic location and the prevalence of acne, with lower prevalence of acne in rural compared with urban populations."
9781908541024,ch_12,"The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial . The etiology of sporadic brain tumors is unknown, but environmental factors are suspected . Most patients with a family history of primary brain tumors have a hereditary disease that is known to be associated with such tumors, such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, familial polyposis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome . However, some patients do not have any underlying or obvious hereditary disorder that would predispose them to primary brain tumors, but nevertheless give a striking history of these tumors in first-degree relatives . Usually, the tumors are found to be high-grade gliomas . Most cases of confirmed familial cancers are multigenerational, and affected individuals are younger than average for the tumor . However, brain tumor families who do not have one of the recognized hereditary diseases usually involve parent-child and sibling-sibling cases; it is rare for more than two generations to be involved . These observations suggest that familial exposure to an environmental toxin or ionizing radiation may account for the clustering of primary brain tumors in these families . Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate patient surveillance for another occult brain tumor or associated disease, for screening family members, and for genetic counseling . Most patients presenting with primary brain tumors will, however, be sporadic cases and the etiology will remain unknown . Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 3500 . Diagnosis requires the presence of two or more of the following features . optic nerve glioma . characteristic osseous lesions . a first-degree relative with neurofibromatosis type 1 . The major neoplastic neurological manifestations of this disorder are optic nerve glioma, astrocytoma and glioblastoma . Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 40 000 . The gene responsible for this disorder, NF2, is located on 22q12 . two of the following . Some patients experienced improvement in hearing as well . Further research is warranted before this treatment can be recommended for patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 .

The major neoplastic neurological manifestation is hemangioblastoma of the CNS; there are no non-neoplastic neurological manifestations (Figure 11.3) . Neoplastic neurological manifestations include subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and retinal giant cell astrocytoma . Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which there is an increased risk of multiple tumors developing in children and young adults, including breast cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas and primary brain tumors . at least one first-degree relative with any tumor before age 45, or . Neoplastic neurological manifestations of the disease are glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, low-grade astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor . There are no non-neoplastic manifestations . The incidence of this syndrome is unknown . Diagnosis requires the coexistence of primary brain and colon tumors . There are two distinct syndromes . The neoplastic neurological manifestations of the syndrome are glioblastoma and medulloblastoma; there are no non-neoplastic manifestations . Tumor-like cysts . They are midline tumors that arise from fetal neural and ectodermal tissues . These lesions typically present in childhood . Patients who are experiencing symptoms should have the cyst resected; often, an endoscopic approach is used to achieve safe removal . It is safe to follow asymptomatic patients radiographically . They can arise in either the sellar or suprasellar region, with 70% of these cysts bridging these two compartments . Neurenteric cysts are congenital epithelial cysts that occur in the spinal canal or posterior fossa . Brain tumor syndromes and tumor-like cysts . ","There are several syndromes associated with an inherited predisposition to a variety of brain tumors. However, the vast majority of brain tumors are not inherited. Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate surveillance of individuals at high risk of developing an occult brain tumor or associated disease and for genetic counseling. Recent advances in the molecular biology of familial brain tumor syndromes have suggested new therapies that have the potential to dramatically change the manifestations of these diseases. Cysts are common imaging findings; location, imaging characteristics and other features may help to establish the most likely diagnosis. Dermoids and epidermoids are benign congenital lesions that typically produce symptoms as they gradually increase in size. Total or subtotal resection is the treatment of choice. Colloid cysts should be resected using modern microneuro-surgical techniques."
9781908541086,ch_4,"The highest age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence rate was 8.3 per 100000 person-years in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, using an extensive case-finding approach during the period of 1935-1989 . Sex differences . Eating disorders are far more prevalent among women . The UK's Royal College of Psychiatrists states that girls and women are ten times more likely than boys and men to suffer from anorexia . In the Rochester study the overall annual age-adjusted incidence was 14.6 women per 100000 inhabitants . For men, the overall age-adjusted incidence was 1.8 per 100000 inhabitants . Age groups affected . In the same study in Rochester, 69.4 in 100000 15-19 year-old girls had anorexia, which made it the third most frequent disorder among teenage girls in the USA . Time analyses showed that the incidence of anorexia in women decreased from 16.6 per 100000 person-years in 1935-1939 to 7 per 100000 in 1950-1954, but then increased to 26.3 per 100000 in 1980-1984 . In Europe, the incidence of anorexia seems to have been rather stable since 1970 . Studies of at least 1000 girls and young women (aged 10-23 years), including face-to-face interviews, have shown the overall prevalence of anorexia to range from 0.1% to 0.9% . Among adult women, the lifetime prevalence of anorexia ranges from 0.3% according to a narrow clinical definition to 3.7% according to a broad clinical definition . In a meta-analysis, the 1-year prevalence rate of anorexia in the community was calculated as 0.37% in young females . The peak age of onset of anorexia is between 13 and 15 years of age . Thus prevalence and incidence are particularly high among 15-25-year-olds, who constitute approximately 40% of all identified cases (Figure 2.1) . Personality characteristics and eating disorder psychopathology are unique in this population and the course of the disorder in this group is particularly severe . Ethnic differences . Anorexia has long been considered as a disorder affecting mainly young women from middle to high economic classes in wealthy countries . While the disorder continues to be more prevalent in Western industrialized nations of white ethnicity and in middle- to upper-class women, there is an increasing diversity of those affected in terms of socioeconomic status and ethnicity, including African, Asian and Indian groups . In the USA, significant differences in the prevalence of anorexia were found by race in a geographically and economically diverse community sample of white and black 19-24-year-old women; none of the black women was found to have had anorexia (Figure 2.2) . Only a few incidence studies of bulimia have been conducted, with an annual incidence rate of 13.5 per 100000 person-years in Rochester, USA, and 6.6 per 100000 person-years in the UK . Sex differences . As with other eating disorders, bulimia has a much higher prevalence in women than in men . The reported lifetime prevalence of bulimia ranges from 1.0% to 2.8% among women, and is about 0.5% among men . The male to female prevalence ratio for bulimia is 1:5 . However, the disorder may be increasingly affecting male athletes and performers . Age groups affected . The condition is less frequently found in teenagers than in adult women . Ethnic differences . Bulimia is more commonly found in Western industrialized nations, specifically in populations that are of middle- and upper-class socioeconomic status . Nevertheless, in the past decade, populations of young African, Latino and Asian women have also been adversely affected as bulimia has reached more diverse populations . In the US community sample of women aged 19-24 years of age described above, the odds of detecting bulimia in white women were six times that of black women (see Figure 2.2) . Other eating disorders . Epidemiological studies show that even in individuals who do not match the criteria for a specific eating disorder, patterns of 'disordered eating' are highly prevalent . 'Eating disorders not otherwise specified' (EDNOS; see 1 . iii) are probably more common than classic eating disorders in young people . In both adolescents and adults, atypical eating disorders (EDNOS) account for more than 50% of cases in the community and in eating disorder treatment clinics . ","Eating disorders are more common in women than men, but disordered eating is increasingly being seen in male athletes and performers. Both anorexia and bulimia are more prevalent in Western industrialized nations of white ethnicity and in middle- to upper-class women, but the disorders are now affecting more diverse populations in terms of ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Bulimia is more common in adults than teenagers, while anorexia is more common in adolescent girls. Disordered eating is probably more common than classic eating disorders in adolescents and young adults."
9781908541062,ch_6,"There are no pathognomonic clinical or laboratory features of RA, and there are a number of potential differential diagnoses (Table 5.1) . The diagnosis of RA rests on the presence of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features . A tree algorithm can also be used to classify RA (Figure 5.1) . The most common joints to be affected by RA at presentation are the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP)joints of the hands, and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints of the feet . In addition to pain and swelling, early morning stiffness of affected joint areas is highly characteristic . Range of joint motion is restricted by synovitis of both the joints themselves and the tendon sheaths . While this is the most common presentation of RA, there are many other possibilities . The disease can affect any synovial joint, and larger joints such as the elbows, shoulders or knees may also be involved . Unusual symptoms reflect the involvement of joints such as the crico-arytenoid joint of the larynx, with resultant hoarseness . The picture of established RA is changing as a result of effective therapies being used earlier in the disease . Thus, the signs may be similar to those of early disease, although more joints generally become affected as the disease becomes established . Subluxation and ulnar deviation at the MCP joints, and subluxation at the wrist are also characteristic features of established RA . In the feet, the subtalar joint and talonavicular joint are more commonly affected than the ankle joint itself . Disease of the MTP joints and associated tendons results in splaying and clawing of the toes, followed by subluxation . In established RA, there is significant muscle wasting around affected joints . RA can affect the cervical spine at any level, leading to various sequelae . More commonly, synovitis of the apophyseal joints at lower cervical levels leads to subluxation and spinal cord compression . Entrapment neuropathies are also common causes of pain, neurological symptoms and muscle wasting in RA . Extra-articular features . Most extra-articular features of RA occur in RF-positive individuals with severe active joint disease . In particular, corneal 'melts' frequently arise in elderly patients with minimal inflammatory joint symptoms . There is no obvious explanation for this paradox, which emphasizes the importance of regular and systematic review of RA patients by a specialist throughout the course of their disease . Systemic features . These are usually subcutaneous and occur most commonly overlying pressure points . Nodules often improve with effective treatment of RA, but methotrexate may worsen nodulosis in some patients despite improvement in articular disease activity . Lymphadenopathy is also associated with active RA and may coexist with systemic features such as fever and weight loss, raising the possibility of lymphoma . It is important to distinguish disease-related changes in these test results from abnormalities induced by therapies . Active RA is often associated with anemia . In common with other inflammatory conditions, thrombocytosis may occur in active RA, secondary to IL-6-mediated megakaryocyte stimulation . In Felty's syndrome, patients with RA develop splenomegaly with features of hypersplenism (pancytopenia in the peripheral blood) . Chest disease . Lung involvement is common in RA, with pleural disease being present in up to 50% of postmortem examinations . In a community-based study, 6% of RA patients developed symptomatic interstitial lung disease within 10 years of disease onset . However, one study reported that 19% of unselected RA patients had alveolitis on high-resolution CT scan . The most common ocular complication of RA is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eyes (xerophthalmia) . Raynaud's symptoms are common in the general population but have an increased prevalence in patients with RA and other connective tissue diseases . Leg ulcers may also be vasculitic in RA (Figure 5.7) . Osteoporosis is a common and underdiagnosed complication of RA . Clinical features . The pathological and etiologic heterogeneity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is reflected clinically, and RA can be difficult to diagnose in its earliest stages . ",Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a variety of articular and extra-articular manifestations. The RA spectrum ranges from mild easily controlled disease to progressive destructive disease with organ- and life-threatening extra-articular complications. Extra-articular disease activity does not always parallel joint inflammation. Patients require close and regular monitoring by a specialist clinician to treat their joint disease and also to promptly diagnose and manage extra-articular manifestations.
9781910797006,ch04,"Similarly, sequential measures, which track changes in lung function, may also be more sensitive indicators . Serial measures in at-risk individuals can demonstrate loss of function even if the measurements themselves are still in the normal range . Diagnosing COPD using spirometry . Spirometry is the most robust test of airflow limitation in patients with COPD . Classification of severity . Patients with COPD typically show a decrease in both the FEV and the FEV :FVC ratio (the latter being a more sensitive measure of early airflow limitation) . Several approaches have been adopted that combine various features into a single measure of COPD severity . This can take 15 seconds or more in a patient with severe airway obstruction . The test reproducibility is an excellent measure of the effort exerted by the patient and the quality of the test . In assessing FEV, the following points should be remembered . If patients have taken a bronchodilator, results may be improved from 'baseline' . Patients should be sitting in an upright position . Although repeated measurements of PEF can replace measurement of FEV, single measurements are not as useful as the variation is so high . Bronchodilator reversibility testing . The main objectives of a bronchodilator reversibility test in COPD are . The use of bronchodilator testing in patients with COPD is limited by the variability of the FEV measurement itself, and by the fact that, by definition, patients with COPD may have only a small degree of reversibility, which is often within the error of the measurement . Daily variations in airway smooth muscle tone may affect the response to bronchodilators in patients with COPD . Treatment of patients with COPD with bronchodilators is guided by clinical response, not by spirometry . In patients with COPD, bronchodilator reversibility testing or small changes in FEV over time are predictive of disease progression or response to treatment . Specialized lung function tests . DLco values are normal in asthma, but below normal in many patients with COPD . capillary blood volume . This will underestimate alveolar volume in patients with severe COPD . Oximeters can also be used to measure changes in oxygenation during acute exacerbations . Exercise tests . Patients with COPD have the same oxygen consumption for a given workload as normal individuals . In many patients with COPD, expiratory airflow is limited within the tidal volume range . Decline in oxygenation with exercise is generally monitored by measurement of percutaneous oxygen saturation . Three principal forms of exercise test are performed in COPD: progressive symptom-limited exercise, self-paced exercise and steady-state exercise . Other tests may be used in special circumstances . Progressive symptom-limited exercise tests require patients to maintain exercise on a treadmill or a cycle until symptoms prevent them from continuing . A change in 30 meters over the 6-minute test may indicate a significant change in clinical status . This assessment is seldom required in patients with COPD . They are useful in some cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain and in assessing patients for surgery . Assessment of breathlessness . The score is the distance along the line that the patient has marked . The SGRQ has been most validated in COPD . The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was developed using rigorous psychometric methods to measure health status . These measurements can be useful in evaluating patients with breathlessness or exercise intolerance that is unexplained by the severity of the lung function abnormality, as well as patients with suspected peripheral muscle weakness . Patients with COPD become increasingly hypoxemic during sleep, particularly during rapid eye movement sleep . Other assessments . In patients with severe COPD, identifying polycythemia is important since it predisposes to vascular events . Anemia is now recognized to be more common than previously thought and may affect over 25% of patients with COPD . The presence of anemia indicates a poor prognosis in patients with COPD receiving long-term oxygen treatment . Routine ECG is not required in the assessment of patients with COPD, and is an insensitive technique in the diagnosis of cor pulmonale . It is often difficult to differentiate some patients with chronic asthma from those with COPD, and it is often assumed that asthma and COPD coexist in these patients . ","Spirometry is the most important measurement in COPD and is essential for diagnosis. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are recorded in absolute values (liters) and also as a percentage of the predicted values for the individual depending on age, height, sex and ethnic origin. An FEV over 80% of the predicted value is considered to be normal. This does not exclude the presence of disease. A post-bronchodilator FEV :FVC ratio below 0.7 indicates chronic airflow limitation and is a diagnostic criterion for COPD. A standardized technique must be employed in spirometry assessment. It is critical that the expiratory flow trace reaches a plateau to prove that the patient has reached the FVC. Reversibility testing to bronchodilators is useful in differential diagnosis to distinguish those with marked reversibility indicative of asthma. There is no standard assessment of reversibility; generally, however, an improvement in FEV of both 200 mL and 12% over the baseline is interpreted as a positive result. Peak expiratory flow rate is not the best assessment of airway obstruction in COPD and may underestimate the degree of airway obstruction. Further tests of lung volumes and the diffusing capacity in the lung for carbon monoxide may be helpful in some cases."
9781908541901,ch_4,"At presentation, cardiac biomarkers may be normal or elevated . In this scenario, the keys to optimizing patient outcomes in ACS are . accurate initial diagnosis . appropriate risk stratification . The Levine sign, in which a patient places a clenched fist over the chest while describing the pain, is classically seen in patients with MI . Useful questions to ask the patient about their chest pain include . How severe is it? . The neurological examination should focus on the level of patient alertness and any evidence of stroke . Patients with ACS frequently exhibit anxiety and restlessness, diaphoresis and skin pallor . Body temperature is likely to be normal in patients with UA but elevated during MI . An abnormal cardiac examination will be observed more often in patients with MI than in those with UA . ST-segment deviation . ST-segment depression of 0.2 mV or more carries about a sixfold increased mortality risk . ST-segment depression combined with transient ST elevation identifies an even higher-risk subgroup . ST-segment elevation of 0.1 mV or more in at least two contiguous leads indicates acute MI in 90% of patients . Other tests, although not usually performed on a routine basis, may help to identify patients at greatest risk of arrhythmic death . Markers of myocardial injury . Elevated circulating levels of these substances are a hallmark of MI . They are therefore a useful indicator in patients at high risk of ACS and are helpful in guiding therapies . Markers of inflammation . In most studies, hsCRP greater than 3 mg/L was associated with cardiovascular risk . Markers of neurohormonal activation . Therefore, these markers lack specificity to either include or exclude patients with ACS . Natriuretic peptide levels usually increase after the initiation of ACS, with peak levels observed hours after the ACS episode, gradually decreasing days later . Persistently elevated levels in the days and weeks after an ACS episode may identify patients with a high risk for cardiovascular death or heart failure, even in the setting of a normal ejection fraction . Markers of acute endogenous stress . In contrast to conventional cardiac biomarkers that reach their peak levels 14-16 hours after the onset of symptoms, a rapid increase in copeptin levels following ACS may help in faster diagnosis and treatment of ACS patients . However, because these measurements are affected by age, weight, race and various medications, their value as an independent risk marker for ACS patients is limited . ischemic symptoms . ECG changes indicative of ischemia (ST-segment elevation or depression) . Pathological findings of an acute MI . The patient may or may not remember previous symptoms . At present, its clinical utility is greatest in patients with an intermediate probability of ACS . Those with no more than two variables are considered to be at low risk (Table 2.6) . The GRACE risk score . In the GRACE risk model, eight variables are used to predict whether a patient will die or have a MI in the hospital or in the next 6 months . GRACE uses variables derived from a registry of consecutive ACS patients, rather than patients in randomized trials (as in other scores) with specific inclusion-exclusion criteria . Application of risk scores . Optimizing patient outcomes . The timing of catheterization in the hemodynamically stable patient with UA/NSTEMI depends upon the assessment of risk . Therefore, proper initial diagnosis and risk stratification are critical to optimize patient outcomes in ACS (Figure 2.2) . Bleeding risk . Invasive and non-invasive management strategies for ACS reduce the recurrence of ischemic events, but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding . Clinical and therapeutic factors associated with an increased bleeding risk are shown in Table 2.9 . Many of the characteristics associated with a heightened risk of bleeding are the same for ischemia . Bleeding risk scores . The score is divided into: very low risk (<= 20); low risk (21-30); moderate risk (31-40); high risk (41-50); and very high risk (> 50) . It has relatively high accuracy for estimating bleeding risk by incorporating admission and treatment variables (Table 2.10) . The ACUITY risk score identified patients at increased risk for non-CABG-related bleeding and subsequent 1-year mortality . ","Clinical recognition of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) requires a careful assessment of the clinical presentation and history, application of appropriate imaging techniques and measurement of biomarkers. A patient's symptom description is a critical diagnostic step, and typical symptoms such as chest heaviness, oppression and retrosternal burning are important angina symptoms. A 12-lead ECG should be performed and reviewed by an experienced clinician in all patients with suspected ACS within 10 minutes of first medical contact (id est on first contact with emergency medical services either outside or in hospital). If the likelihood of ACS is high but the 12-lead ECG is normal, a 17-lead ECG may be performed to reveal 'true posterior' ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Early risk stratification is strongly recommended. Optimal risk stratification requires a multivariable approach. Clinical validated risk-stratification models such as the TIMI or GRACE risk scores are useful for assisting in management strategies and timing of invasive treatment in patients with suspected ACS. Invasive and non-invasive management strategies for ACS reduce the recurrence of ischemic events, but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Major bleeding and the need for transfusion are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality as well as a long-term risk of death or MI; gastrointestinal and femoral access site bleeding are the most frequent bleeding complications."
9781910797907,chp5,"Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency can be associated with a range of complications (Table 5.1) . Although complications are more frequent in patients with severe anemia and frequent transfusions, the likelihood of a given complication in an individual patient is not predictable based on hemoglobin and transfusion burden and thus all patients with PK deficiency require regular monitoring (Table 5.2) . Main complications . In patients who receive regular blood transfusions, complete blood counts should be evaluated before transfusion . Patients who receive transfusions, regularly or irregularly, should have annual viral screening . Pregnancy can also be a common hemolytic trigger . scleral icterus and jaundice associated with significant hemolysis . Patients with PK deficiency who have an acute parvovirus infection will usually require a transfusion, even if they have never been previously transfused . Parvovirus infection will occur only once in a patient's lifetime . Nearly every patient with PK deficiency will have an elevated indirect bilirubin level (Figure 5.1) . Thus, splenectomy should not be pursued to improve jaundice in patients with PK deficiency . Gallstones are a frequent complication in patients of all ages with PK deficiency because of the increased unconjugated bilirubin related to hemolysis . Many individuals with PK deficiency develop splenomegaly . Transfusion-associated hemosiderosis is a predictable complication of chronic transfusion therapy as the body will receive iron from the transfused RBCs, but lacks a mechanism for getting rid of any excess . However, transfusion-independent iron loading also occurs in patients with PK deficiency and is under-recognized, occurring at all ages and in patients with both mild and more severe anemia . Transfusion-related iron loading . The association between transfusions and iron loading is similar in PK deficiency to that seen in other transfusion-dependent red cell disorders . Regular ferritin monitoring before transfusions and annual MRI assessment are indicated in patients who receive transfusions, and ongoing chelation therapy is necessary in those who receive regular transfusions . Non-transfusion-related iron loading . Hemosiderosis also occurs frequently in individuals with PK deficiency in the absence of transfusions . Non-transfusion-related iron loading can occur at all ages and in patients with all hemoglobin levels . Although patients with both PK deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis will have an increased risk of iron loading, ineffective erythropoiesis associated with PK deficiency is likely to be the main contributor to transfusion-independent iron loading in this hemolytic disorder . Given that iron loading occurs through the gastrointestinal route, patients with PK deficiency should avoid iron supplements, including multivitamins with iron, and excessive consumption of foods high in iron . While cardiac iron loading occurs, it is significantly less frequent than hepatic iron overload . In some patients, ferritin levels significantly underestimate the degree of hepatic iron, particularly if the iron deposition is in the hepatocytes . Because iron loading is common in PK deficiency, all patients, regardless of their transfusion status, should have their iron levels monitored at least annually with ferritin measurement . Chelation therapy may also be needed intermittently in patients who do not receive transfusions as their MRI assessments are monitored . Although extramedullary hematopoiesis is not a frequent complication of PK deficiency, it is not uncommon . Patients with PK deficiency are at risk of low bone mineral density, fractures and bone pain . The risk of osteoporosis is likely to increase with age; however, this has not been well studied in patients with PK deficiency . Similar to other hemolytic disorders, pulmonary hypertension is a complication of PK deficiency . Leg ulcers have also been reported in patients with PK deficiency . Special considerations in pregnancy . Pregnancy in women with PK deficiency has been associated with excellent maternal and fetal outcomes . Before conception, women who have previously received a transfusion should be screened for hepatitis B and C and HIV . During pregnancy, the degree of hemolysis typically worsens and transfusion needs increase . The majority of women will be transfused during pregnancy and/or directly after the delivery, regardless of their transfusion status before pregnancy . Complications in the newborn . In the past, prenatal assessment for PK deficiency depended on the observation of symptoms during ultrasound scans . Other complications . ","The hemolytic anemia associated with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency can range from mild to severe, with hemoglobin levels typically in the range of 6-12 g/dL. It can be exacerbated by hemolytic episodes and aplastic crises. Gallstones are a common complication of PK deficiency and the risk persists after splenectomy. Cholecystectomy should be considered at the time of splenectomy regardless of the presence of gallstones. Many patients with PK deficiency will have prenatal and neonatal complications including hyperbilirubinemia, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation and perinatal anemia. Transfusion-independent iron loading can occur at any age and with any severity of anemia. Annual monitoring of iron is indicated in all patients with PK deficiency, regardless of transfusion status. Chelation may be intermittently prescribed. Other complications of PK deficiency can include low bone density, extramedullary hematopoiesis, pulmonary hypertension and leg ulcers. In pregnant women with PK deficiency, recommendations for management include close fetal monitoring, consideration of transfusions (because hemolysis is exacerbated) and avoidance of iron-containing supplements."
9781912776153,chp6,"The patient's physical, psychological and biochemical status should be assessed thoroughly before considering treatment . Many cardiac arrhythmias are not life-threatening, and patients should be reassured accordingly . However, many, if not most, patients will require an evaluation in a cardiology or arrhythmia clinic . General treatment principles . When making any decision about initiating treatment, care must be taken to assess the benefits and risks . Reasons for treatment may include . impaired quality of life, the burden on the patient of the cardiac arrhythmia . risk of sudden death . This will help to determine whether treatment is required, and what the safest and most effective treatment would be . The options for treatment are . reassurance only (no active treatment) . pharmacological treatment (antiarrhythmic drug therapy) . Some arrhythmias do not require any intervention . When deciding to provide explanation and reassurance only, the physician must be certain that the patient's heart is structurally normal . An echocardiogram is often necessary for patients with resistant or long-standing symptoms . Table 6.1 lists the features to explain to patients with normal ectopic beats . Patients should be told that the frequency of atrial ectopy may vary over time, but generally reassurance only is sufficient . Similar to atrial ectopic beats, ventricular ectopic beats are often benign, especially in patients without overt heart disease . Occasionally, cognitive therapy is required . Such patients may have an increased risk of sudden death and require referral to a cardiologist . Pharmacological treatment . Classification of drugs . Although useful as a starting point, this requires extrapolation to specific arrhythmias . All antiarrhythmic drugs have side effects, most of which are drug-specific . No drug taken orally is effective immediately, although some drugs can be useful when taken as soon as the arrhythmia begins . Table 6.3 summarizes the drugs that can be used for specific arrhythmias . Outpatient initiation of antiarrhythmic agents is generally considered for patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and also in patients with paroxysmal AF . As a result, it is a safe and effective treatment for many arrhythmias . The procedure . The use of short-acting anesthesia allows cardioversion to be performed in a day-case setting, as patients usually recover rapidly after the procedure . Sinus rhythm can be restored in nearly all patients by DC cardioversion, but the rate of relapse will depend on the underlying arrhythmia . Thromboembolic events have been reported in 1-7% of patients with AF who do not receive anticoagulation before cardioversion, but the risk is very low in adequately anticoagulated patients . Sinus arrest occurs more frequently in patients who have received multiple antiarrhythmic agents at the time of cardioversion . The procedure . RFA is performed in the electrophysiology laboratory . Patients are positioned and draped in the supine position . Conscious sedation or general anesthesia is administered, according to the clinical diagnosis and/or patient preference . Success rates are high, recurrence is uncommon, the arrhythmia is often cured and lifelong drug therapy is no longer required . Ablation of accessory pathways . For accessory pathways as a whole, RFA is successful in 95% of cases as a first procedure . RFA of accessory pathways is the treatment of choice for all patients except for . patients who are reluctant to undergo ablation and prefer the use of an antiarrhythmic agent . patients who are pregnant, in whom the use of fluoroscopy must be avoided . Ablation of concealed pathways . If RFA is performed during SVT, typically the tachycardia suddenly stops and the patient returns to sinus rhythm . Ablation of the slow pathway is performed . In general, RFA produces better long-term outcomes . Although this can be a highly successful treatment for epicardial arrhythmias, it involves small but significant risks . Patients with pre-excitation have a very small risk of sudden death, which must be considered even in asymptomatic individuals . Detraining may reduce arrhythmia burden in some of these patients . ","Radiofrequency (catheter) ablation can cure many types of arrhythmia. Drug therapy can be useful to suppress symptoms initially, but is not curative. Symptomatic patients should be considered for ablative therapy."
9781910797273,chp3,"MS became recognized as a clinicopathological entity around 1870, when Charcot noted a link between the symptoms of MS and nerve damage . We now know that MS is an inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease that affects multiple sites across the CNS . Clinically isolated syndrome . A person has clinically definite MS when there is objective clinical evidence of lesion dissemination in time (DIT) and space (DIS) . Importantly, the incorporation of MRI into modern diagnostic criteria permits a diagnosis of MS to be made in some patients at the time of CIS . It is important to define the subtype of MS, as this will guide prognosis and choice of disease-modifying therapy . The recognized patterns of MS are . secondary progressive . primary progressive . progressive relapsing . Relapsing remitting disease is the most common form of MS, accounting for 65-70% of patients . In early disease, recovery after a relapse (remission) is often near complete, but incomplete recovery is common in established disease and in these instances patients with MS often accrue disability with each successive relapse (Figure 3.1) . Secondary progressive disease . In most cases (up to 75% of people with relapsing remitting disease) there is an eventual progression to the secondary progressive phase of MS . Risk factors for progression to secondary progressive MS are shown in Table 3.1 . Primary progressive disease comprises approximately 10-15% of patients with MS . Primary progressive MS typically has a later onset than relapsing remitting MS . Progressive relapsing disease . Progressive relapsing disease should therefore be differentiated from primary and secondary progressive disease . Patient history . Other autoimmune diseases . As there is an association between MS and other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, vitiligo and inflammatory bowel disease, it is important to include questions about these when taking a history . It is therefore important to document any family history of MS or autoimmune diseases (which are often familial) . The onset of MS tends to be earlier in people with familial MS . Smoking is a risk factor for MS . Signs and symptoms . MS manifests with symptoms or signs that arise from focal inflammatory lesions within the CNS . Lesions affecting the brainstem and cerebellar pathways are common in patients with MS, and can lead to poor coordination . Balance is commonly affected . Patients may complain of slurred speech . Sensory symptoms . Constipation is a common disturbance in the later stages of the disease . Patients with MS are particularly vulnerable to 'subcortical' deficits in information processing and spatial recall . Patients with MS are up to four times more likely to experience at least one major depressive episode than the general population . Other symptoms common in MS include fatigue, tremor and pain, which are covered in more detail in the treatment chapter . Table 3.4 provides an overview of the investigations employed in the work up for MS . Magnetic resonance imaging remains the most important investigation in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS . Followed over time, MRI scans in MS typically 'wax and wane', with the emergence of new lesions and the involution of older lesions . Monitoring disease activity . Annual MRI is used in some MS centers to monitor for subclinical MS activity or radiological relapses; the ultimate goal is NEDA (no evidence of disease activity), id est the triad of no clinical relapses, no new MRI activity and no evidence of disease progression . These blood tests are normal/negative in MS, but in patients with MS mimics they may reveal evidence of . They are usually absent in ADEM, NMO and systemic disease with CNS manifestations . CSF examination should be reserved for patients with atypical clinical presentations or unusual MRI features . As the sophistication of MRI has increased, the diagnostic criteria for MS have been repeatedly reviewed and revised . This entity may be difficult to differentiate from MS on both clinical and radiological grounds . Monitoring disease progression . help needed with toilet use . help needed with bathing . help needed with grooming . help needed with dressing . help needed with feeding . MRI is routinely used to monitor disease activity and progression and response to disease-modifying therapy . MRI findings at presentation can be useful for predicting disease progression . ","The clinical presentation of MS depends on the location of inflammatory lesions in the CNS. Pathology in the optic nerve, spinal cord and brainstem can result in a broad range of signs and symptoms. However, the majority of deep white matter lesions in the hemispheres are clinically silent. People with MS do not always present with the first episode of demyelination. It is therefore important to determine whether the patient has experienced a prior neurological disturbance of any sort (exempli gratia mild or temporary visual blurring). Depending on MRI findings, MS can be diagnosed at the first presentation because of demyelination within the CNS; this is termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). To diagnose MS, lesions must be shown to be present, separated by space and time. The number of asymptomatic demyelinating lesions on MRI at the time of CIS strongly predicts the likelihood of the patient developing clinically definite MS. The pattern of MS - relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive or progressive relapsing - will guide prognosis and choice of disease-modifying therapy. These definitions are in flux; one study suggested the term 'active' to indicate ongoing inflammation on brain MRI independent of the clinical course. Rarer alternative causes of inflammatory demyelination within the CNS such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) should be considered and excluded in the diagnostic work-up of MS. Red flag features that suggest an alternative diagnosis include involvement of the peripheral nervous system, atypical MRI findings or systemic features of disease. MRI is the most important investigation in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS. MS progression can be measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and with MRI."
9781908541666,ch_5,"Type 2 diabetes occurs when insulin secretion is insufficient to meet insulin demand, resulting in hyperglycemia . The keys are insulin resistance in muscle (thereby increasing insulin demand), insulin resistance in liver (thereby increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis) and eventual beta cell failure with relative insulin deficiency (that is, unable to meet insulin demand) . While there is relative insulin deficiency in type 2 diabetes, it is rarely absolute deficiency as in type 1 diabetes, thus ketoacidosis does not occur with hyperglycemia . The symptoms of type 2 diabetes are outlined in Table 4.1 . Type 2 diabetes is often considered a lifestyle disease . This is a misunderstanding, as type 2 diabetes has a strong genetic background, stronger in fact than that for type 1 diabetes . In monozygotic twins, there is a 95% concordance for type 2 diabetes; in contrast, the concordance for type 1 diabetes is 30-50% . Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents hyperglycemia, the end stage of beta cell dysfunction, with numerous pathways to reach this endpoint . This has become evident as different genes have been found in different populations . Interestingly, most of the genes identified for type 2 diabetes concern the beta cell . Mutational forms of type 2 diabetes explain only a small proportion of cases, fewer than 2% . In contrast, a number of different genetic polymorphisms have been described in different populations that explain susceptibility to the commoner forms of type 2 diabetes . Environmental factors . Environmental factors play a major role in increasing diabetes risk . Modifying these environmental factors is the focus of international public health efforts to curb the increasing global prevalence of type 2 diabetes and is the cornerstone of treatment and/or prevention of type 2 diabetes . The effectiveness of this approach is best demonstrated by the Diabetes Prevention Program, in which increased physical activity and modest weight reduction reduced the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes by over 50% at 3 years . Obesity has the strongest impact on promoting all forms of diabetes, including those without a clear genetic susceptibility . Insulin resistance is considered a central metabolic feature of many cases of type 2 diabetes . While it is often present in obesity-associated diabetes, it is not universal . In fact, insulin resistance is not present in many people with type 2 diabetes, particularly leaner individuals . Insulin resistance accompanies abdominal obesity and is present in atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease . It accompanies dyslipidemia characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and low-HDL cholesterol, which is often found in type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome . Insulin resistance is considered the link that explains the clustering of abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and dyslipidemia . Insulin resistance refers to the reduced ability of circulating insulin to result in cellular glucose uptake . Insulin acts by stimulating its receptor on the cell surface (Figure 4.1) . Overall, such perturbation results in a reduced glucose-uptake response to insulin (insulin resistance) . The body attempts to override this by producing more insulin (hyperinsulinemia) . When the pancreatic beta cells can no longer produce sufficient insulin to overcome insulin resistance, blood glucose levels start to rise . Insulin resistance may occur at many points in the insulin signaling cascade . Rarely, genetic mutations within the insulin receptor or its substrate can result in insulin resistance . More frequently, increased circulating fatty acids (from nutrient excess or obesity) can interfere with insulin signaling through a mechanism termed lipotoxicity . Adipokines can interfere with insulin action through a number of specific pathways involving intracellular inflammation signal transduction pathways that link in to insulin signaling pathways . These disturbances in inflammation add to the metabolic disturbances in the regulation of insulin signaling and contribute to insulin resistance . Insulin resistance is also found in the liver . With failing insulin secretion, there is insufficient insulin to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis, particularly overnight . Lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes is found in the muscle cells, where glucose is the major substrate . However, it has also been reported in the pancreas, where the effects of excess lipid can contribute to damage to insulin-secreting beta cells . Thus, in the situation of nutrient excess and obesity, where there are excess amounts of circulating fatty acids, lipotoxicity can increase insulin resistance (and the demand for insulin) and diminish the ability to respond by worsening beta cell impairment (see Figure 4.2) . ","Type 2 diabetes results from a relative deficiency of insulin, often in the context of insulin resistance. Nutrient excess and obesity contribute to insulin resistance, through mechanisms that include cell signaling defects, lipotoxicity and inflammation. As the pancreatic secretion of insulin starts to fail, glucose levels progressively rise due to dysregulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis."
9781908541277,ch_6,"Figure 3.1 shows some common etiologies in relation to age . Is the episode an epileptic seizure? . What is (are) the seizure type(s)? . Furthermore, non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (also called pseudoseizures) are estimated to occur in up to 45% of patients referred to specialist centers with apparently refractory epilepsy . This misidentification of non-epileptic conditions as epilepsy can lead to unnecessary treatments that are potentially harmful, and can delay the start of appropriate therapy . The temptation to attach a label of 'epilepsy' should be resisted if there is any doubt about the diagnosis despite a thorough evaluation . Both the physician and patient must simply await the passage of time before coming to a firm conclusion . Further challenges of diagnosis and management may arise in patients in whom non-epileptic events coexist with epileptic seizures or develop as a substitute for epileptic seizures once the epilepsy is controlled . Acute symptomatic seizures (also called provoked seizures) must be distinguished from unprovoked (epileptic) seizures . Common examples include seizures during an acute stroke, encephalitis or electrolyte disturbance . It has been estimated that up to 50% of all seizures may be considered to be acute symptomatic . Unlike epileptic seizures, acute symptomatic seizures are not necessarily characterized by a tendency for recurrence . Clinical evaluation . Despite advances in investigational technologies, the diagnosis of epilepsy remains essentially clinical, and is based on a detailed description of the events experienced by the patient before, during and after a seizure . In addition to a full medical and social history, the patient should be asked about factors that may precipitate seizures by lowering the threshold for such an event (Table 3.3) . Investigational technologies . Electroencephalography can support the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and help with the classification of partial-onset or generalized seizures . It is important to give the electroencephalographer detailed information concerning the patient's age, seizure behavior and response to AEDs . Routine EEGs are often insensitive - more than 50% of patients with epilepsy will have a normal trace . Diagnostic yield can also be increased by repeat recordings . If the initial EEG is unremarkable and the diagnosis remains in doubt, a sleep-deprivation study is recommended . In a patient with suspected non-convulsive status epilepticus (see Chapter 7), an EEG can be diagnostic . Prolonged ambulatory recording . Video-EEG telemetry . This investigation is mandatory as part of the evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and may be the only way to distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic seizures . In some situations, it usefully identifies candidates for surgery among patients with normal neuroimaging results . EEG with functional MRI (fMRI) . Advances in technology have allowed combined recording of EEG during fMRI, so that interictal EEG changes can be spatially localized . Its role in the clinical management of epilepsy, particularly in selection of surgical candidacy in the case of drug resistance, is an area of active research . Brain imaging . Structural imaging . Imaging studies of the brain to look for underlying structural abnormalities are essential for the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of most patients with epilepsy, particularly those presenting with partial-onset seizures . The imaging modality of choice is MRI . In children, MRI is particularly useful in identifying congenital abnormalities, such as neuronal migration disorders and arteriovenous malformations . For patients in mid-life and beyond, scans are helpful in evaluating stroke and cerebral degeneration, and in identifying primary and secondary neoplasia . Any patient with refractory epilepsy in whom the initial MRI scan is normal should have a high-resolution scan to exclude hippocampal atrophy and focal cortical dysplasia . worsening in the patient's neurological or cognitive function . increase in the frequency or severity of the seizures . Functional imaging can identify focal abnormalities in cerebral physiology even when structural imaging results are normal . Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate increased blood flow in brain regions in association with seizure activity . Functional neuroimaging techniques have a limited role in routine diagnostic evaluation, but are useful adjuncts in the work-up for epilepsy surgery . ",Epilepsy has many underlying etiologies. A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures. A witness's account is essential for accurate diagnosis of epilepsy and classification of seizures. Electroencephalography can support diagnosis and help with the classification of seizures and syndromes. Structural brain imaging is essential in the diagnostic work-up for patients with seizures suspected of having a focal onset. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for detecting structural abnormalities in the brain. Functional neuroimaging techniques are mainly used as supplementary investigations in patients being considered for epilepsy surgery.
9781910797310,chp8,"This personalized medicine approach has a large effect on patient survival . Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation . To date, nine randomized phase III trials have established reversible EGFR-TKI (erlotinib and gefitinib) and irreversible EGFR-TKI (afatinib) as standard first-line treatment in patients with NSCLC EGFR mutations . However, there is no consensus about which inhibitor will maximize therapeutic efficacy in NSCLC patients with the EGFR mutation . In Caucasian patients, this strategy reported better outcome among T790M de novo-positive patients than T790M-negative patients (16 vs 10.5 months) . After treatment with EGFR-TKI, tumors invariably develop acquired resistance (AR) . Osimertinib has reported an RR of 61% and median PFS of 9.6 months in patients with T790M-positive NSCLC with AR to EGFR-TKI, and has been approved by the FDA . Rociletinib has also reported an RR of 53% and PFS of 8 months in this population . For those patients without T790M who develop AR, platinum-based chemotherapy seems to be a reasonable option beyond participating in clinical trials . ALK rearrangements (ALK +) result from inversions or translocations on chromosome 2 in about 5% of patients with NSCLC . The central nervous system (CNS) is the most common site of relapse or progression in patients taking crizotinib . It has demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients with pretreated ALK + NSCLC (RR 56%, PFS 6.9 months) and in naive patients (RR 72%, PFS 18.4 months), even in patients with intracranial disease . The ALTA-1L trial will compare brigatinib with crizotinib as first-line treatment . Alectinib had a reponse rate of 48% in a phase II trial in patients pretreated with crizotinib, with a median PFS of 8.9 months and clinical activity in patients with brain metastases (BM) . Based on these results, the FDA has approved alectinib in crizotinib-resistant patients . In crizotinib-naive patients, alectinib has demonstrated an RR of 94% and median PFS of 27 months . The ongoing phase III AXEL trial is comparing alectinib with crizotinib in treatment-naive patients . Other actionable alterations in NSCLC . The V600E mutation accounts for 50% of cases . Vemurafenib has demonstrated a response rate of 42% and median PFS of 7.3 months in a cohort of 20 patients with pretreated BRAF V600E NSCLC . In a phase II study, dabrafenib demonstrated activity in patients with pretreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive NSCLC, with a RR of 32% and median PFS of 5.5 months . Crizotinib was tested in 50 patients with the ROS1 rearrangement . The response rate was 72% with a median PFS of 19.2 months . In a European cohort of ROS1 patients, crizotinib reported an 80% response rate and median PFS of 9.1 months . RET rearrangements occur in 1-2% of patients with NSCLC, especially in never smokers . A small phase II study with cabozantinib reported a 44% response rate and median PFS of 7 months in 16 patients with RET fusions . In mouse models, alectinib has reported activity in RET -rearranged NSCLC tumors . MET amplification/mutation . Crizotinib has shown clinical activity in high MET -amplified NSCLC . In a French cohort of 18 patients with pretreated MET -amplified NSCLC, crizotinib had a RR of 39% . HER2 mutations occur in about 2% of lung adenocarcinomas . Dacomitinib has also demonstrated activity in this population (12% RR in patients with HER2 mutations vs 0% in HER2 -amplified patients, with median OS of 9 months in the HER2 -mutant subgroup) . NTRK1 and NTRK2 rearrangements occur in 1-2% of patients with NSCLC . Entrectinib has had promising results in this subpopulation of lung cancer patients . ",All patients with adenocarcinoma should have mutation testing for EGFR and ALK-MET at diagnosis. EGFR mutations at any stage should have treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor until symptomatic progression. Patients with ALK-MET or ROS1 translocations respond well to crizotinib. Second-generation drugs are becoming available. Other driver mutations and targeted therapies need acceleration into the clinic for patient benefit.
9781910797723,chp2,"The possibility of harnessing the immune system to attack cancer cells was first proposed over 100 years ago, but effective immunotherapies have until recently proved elusive because of the ability of cancer cells to evade the immune system . How tumors evade immune attack . Tumor cells can block immune responses in a number of ways . Cancer cell antigens may not be recognized by dendritic cells or APCs . Cancer antigens may be treated as self-antigens, rather than foreign, leading to regulatory T cell (T reg) responses rather than cancer-specific effector responses . T cells may not be trafficked to the tumor, or are prevented from infiltrating the tumor . Factors in the tumor microenvironment (see page 30) may suppress effector T (T eff) cells . The PD-1 receptor pathway . The PD-1 receptor on the surface of T cells plays an important role in regulating the recruitment and activation of T cells, and overexpression of this receptor's ligand, PD-L1, by cancer cells has been reported in several types of cancer, including melanoma and cancers of the lung, kidney, head and neck, and colon . Binding of this receptor to its ligand, PD-L1, can affect the immune response to cancer cells in two ways . In the lymph nodes, overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor-infiltrating immune cells can prevent the priming and activation of new cytotoxic T cells, and subsequently prevent recruitment of these immune cells to the tumor . Within the tumor microenvironment, up-regulation of PD-L1 on cancer cells and immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells leads to deactivation of cytotoxic T cells . In both cases, binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 on the surface of T cells results in the development of T-cell tolerance, with reduced T-cell proliferation, decreased cytokine expression and impaired antigen recognition (Figure 2.2) . As described in Chapter 1, activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells requires positive co-regulatory (or co-stimulatory) signals resulting from binding of CD80 (B7-1) and CD28 on APCs and T cells . Consequently, CTLA-4 is an important immune checkpoint and target for cancer immunotherapy . In particular, the effects of PD-1 are largely confined to the tumor site: expression of PD-L1 is low in non-cancerous tissue . In addition, the stimulation of agonistic receptors on T cells promotes activation of T cells . Further understanding of the biology of immune regulation in cancer will define optimal targets and combinations for therapeutic interventions . Tumors are complex structures consisting of multiple cell types that create a constantly evolving immunosuppressive microenvironment (Figure 2.6) . In addition to the cancer cells themselves, a number of different cell types may contribute to the tumor microenvironment (see Figure 2.6) . endothelial cells, particularly those in the tumor blood vessels, which play an important role in tumor angiogenesis . pericytes, a specialized mesenchymal cell type related to smooth muscle cells, that support the tumor endothelium . immune inflammatory cells, including cells with tumor-promoting activities, such as macrophage subtypes, mast cells and neutrophils, and partially differentiated myeloid progenitor cells . cancer-associated fibroblasts . stem and progenitor cells in the tumor stroma . The aim of immuno-oncology therapies is to restore the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells . inhibiting the suppression of the immune system by tumors . The cancer immunity cycle . The response of the immune system to cancer cells is a cyclical process (Figure 2.1) that may in principle be self-perpetuating, leading to a heightened immune response . Initially, cancer cells are detected by natural killer (NK) cells, which interact with specific ligands on the cancer cell surface, leading to the destruction of the cancer cells . These cytotoxic T cells are transported to the tumor, where they bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins on the cancer cell surface and kill the target cancer cells . In addition to allowing the tumor cell to evade immune attack, these mechanisms may actually facilitate tumor progression . Immunoediting of cancer cells: the 'three Es' . ","The immune response to the presence of cancer cells is a cyclical process that is potentially self-propagating. However, the existence of numerous negative regulators allows tumor cells to evade the immune system. Tumor immunoediting has three components, known as the 'three Es': elimination, equilibrium and evasion:- during the initial elimination phase, some cancer cells are recognized as altered by the immune system and are destroyed- during the equilibrium phase, some cancer cells persist, but the immune response is sufficient to prevent proliferation- eventually, however, selective pressure leads to a predominance of cells that are able to avoid the immune response - escape. The immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and CTLA-4 are key factors in the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. However, there are multiple other potential targets, some of which have inhibitory activity and others agonistic activity in T-cell activation. Solid tumors consist of multiple cell types that together contribute to the development of a microenvironment that favors tumor growth and evasion of the immune system."
9781912776153,chp10,"A wide QRS can occur if . the impulses arise in the ventricle away from the His-Purkinje tissue - ventricular tachycardia (VT) . as a focal abnormality in a structurally normal heart . It is important that a patient is not made worse when treatment is initiated following the diagnosis . Sadly, some patients are occasionally made worse by treating a wide QRS tachycardia as if it were arising in the atria and being conducted with bundle branch block (aberration) . It is therefore generally safer to assume that all regular QRS tachycardias are VT and to initiate treatment on that basis in the first instance . (A patient with supraventricular tachycardia [SVT] treated for VT may not get better immediately but is unlikely to get worse . Usually this diagnostic challenge is not necessary, however, as knowledge of simple clinical features, such as whether the patient has had a previous myocardial infarction, makes VT likely . Emergency treatment . If the patient is hemodynamically compromised, rapid direct-current cardioversion is appropriate, although sedation or anesthesia will be needed if the patient is conscious . Once the patient is stabilized, other investigations are mandatory to ascertain the best long-term treatment . The arrhythmia usually identifies the presence of a significant arrhythmia substrate and a continuing risk of arrhythmia and, potentially, sudden death . If the patient is not hemodynamically compromised, administration of an agent such as lidocaine (lignocaine) or amiodarone is appropriate . Amiodarone has multiple antiarrhythmic actions and is the most potent agent for VT currently available . General treatment principles . The key questions to consider in managing a patient with VT are . Does the patient have a continuing propensity for the arrhythmia? . Does this arrhythmia reflect structural heart disease? . VT in the structurally normal heart . Patients occasionally complain of exercise-induced palpitations, with symptoms typically emerging just after vigorous exercise . Rarely, patients may present with idiopathic VT from the left ventricular summit or left ventricular fascicular VT . The commonest site for fascicular VT is the posterior fascicle, which presents with right bundle left-axis VT (Figure 10.3) . This VT is most often seen in men, is occasionally exercise-related and may show sensitivity to calcium-channel blockers . If patients have a structurally normal heart and the arrhythmia is a 'normal heart VT' they can be treated symptomatically, using medication such as beta-blockers or curative catheter ablation (which has become the treatment of choice for this focal arrhythmia) . Providing the patient is not syncopal, sudden death is rare . The 'normal heart VTs' are usually autonomically dependent and may be difficult to induce during electrophysiological study . Even if it is inducible, the VT may not be sustained and so prolonged mapping of the arrhythmia may not be possible . If VT cannot be reliably sustained, then an alternative strategy is pace-mapping . During ablation at the correct site there is often an accelerated burst of VT (automaticity), which is extinguished during continued ablation . The VT has a characteristic 12-lead morphology with a relatively narrow right bundle left-axis appearance (see Figure 10.3) . The VT is calcium-dependent and therefore verapamil-sensitive, and is best treated by catheter ablation . VT with structural heart disease . Patients with evidence of myocardial scarring or a diffuse electrical abnormality are at significant risk of further episodes and sudden death . Occasionally, patients with these conditions present with VT storms with frequent episodes of polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation that are difficult to manage and may require multiple direct-current shocks . Beta-blockers and amiodarone are usually started, and are the mainstay of treatment, but occasionally patients continue to have recurrent episodes despite treatment . However, catheter ablation can be effective at reducing or eliminating ICD shocks in patients with scar-related VT . In these patients, mapping and ablation are usually performed during sinus rhythm in order to avoid the prolonged hypotension usually present during VT, especially with underlying left ventricular dysfunction and general anesthesia . The ablation strategy is very different from SVT ablation (Table 10.1) . ","A wide regular QRS complex indicates ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise. All patients with a wide-complex tachycardia need emergency referral and admission. VT may occur in a structurally normal heart and tends to show characteristic electrocardiogram and clinical features. Catheter ablation is curative for normal heart VT, but palliative for scar-related VT. Wide QRS tachycardia always requires further investigation and referral to an arrhythmia specialist."

In the USA, approximately 50% of patients with psoriasis are not under the care of a physician, probably because . they are frustrated by the lack of understanding and insight into this chronic, highly visible disease, leading to poor patient compliance, especially with topical therapy . remission periods are short with most current therapies . physicians fail to plan treatment/spend time with patients in consultation and discussion . systemic therapy is underutilized for patients with moderate-to-severe disease . Many patients who present with mild psoriasis do not necessarily want active therapy - a diagnosis and reassurance may be sufficient, particularly given that available treatments do not alter the natural history or activity of the disease . Individualizing patient care . Factors in the patient's social history can contribute to disease severity or affect treatment outcome and, although sometimes difficult to change, it is important to recognize such factors in terms of overall disease management . Treatment of coexisting illnesses, particularly acute respiratory infections in younger patients, is important to reduce the risk of an acute flare-up of pre-existing psoriasis . Available treatments . Treatments available for psoriasis include a wide range of topical therapies, phototherapy (including photochemotherapy, see Chapter 6) and a variety of systemic agents, some with potentially significant side effects (see Chapter 7) . Many factors influence the choice of therapy for an individual (Table 4.1) . Approximately 70% of patients with psoriasis can be managed using topical therapy alone . Managing patient expectations . Before beginning therapy, the patient should have a realistic expectation of the outcome . In practice, this means explaining that treatment will be lengthy and is not curative, and that the psoriasis is likely to relapse if therapy is discontinued . precisely what a treatment is designed to achieve and how . where and for how long therapy should be applied . Rotational, combined and sequential therapies . An impressive array of treatments for all forms of psoriasis, whether mild, moderate or severe, is now available . By convention, topical therapy is the preferred first-line treatment for psoriasis . At present, if the response to topical therapy is inadequate, most dermatologists try phototherapy next . However, particularly in the UK and Europe, systemic drugs are now being introduced earlier in treatment algorithms . Psoriasis is a chronic disease that requires long-term therapy, which raises the potential problem of cumulative toxicities . In practice, most rotational and sequential therapy relates to topical treatment . Rotational therapy . The rationale behind elective rotational therapy is that minimizing the duration of drug exposure will minimize the risk of drug-related toxicity . Other investigators have since added other treatments to the rotation and lengthened the duration of the individual treatments . The theory underlying rotational therapy is to discontinue one medication as it is approaching its cumulative toxic dose and then 'rotate' to a different drug that maintains the response but has a different toxicity profile . For example, a patient could theoretically be maintained on methotrexate for several years and, as the cumulative dose neared 1.5 g, could then be rotated to another treatment . Other reasons to rotate therapy include side effects, loss of efficacy and onset of a new flare . Combination therapy . The rationale for elective combination therapy is that combining drugs (with non-overlapping modes of action and side effects) minimizes the dose of each agent and thus minimizes toxicity . In practice, this represents a very useful treatment strategy . Combination therapy is often required for long-term control of psoriasis, as for rheumatoid disease . Various combinations of topical, systemic and light treatment may be needed to clear localized resistant patches and reduce the need for sustained longer-term systemic therapy . Sequential therapy . Using this sequential approach, relatively toxic agents such as methotrexate can be used to achieve improvement quickly when psoriasis flares . Therefore, it is crucial that any long-term course of therapy is planned and coordinated by the dermatologist, primary care physician and patient in order to reduce patient discontent and cumulative long-term side effects . ","Psoriasis is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy. Before beginning therapy, the patient should have a realistic expectation of the outcome. All systemic medications used for psoriasis can have limiting side effects and toxicities. Patient assessment should include reference to important comorbidities. Rotational, combination and sequential therapeutic strategies can reduce side effects and increase efficacy, while maintaining longer-term control of the psoriasis and reducing the frequency and severity of inevitable relapses."

Pain intensity . It is usually very helpful to have the patient fill out a brief history and system-review questionnaire, and complete a pain drawing . The VAS measures pain on a horizontal 10-cm line, where 0 is no pain and 10 cm is the greatest pain ever (Figure 1.1) . A pain drawing is also useful in determining the pattern of the pain and possibly its etiology (Figure 1.2) . Pain duration . For the purposes of diagnostic and management decisions, an episode of low back pain can be considered . Psychological assessment . The more chronic the low back pain disorder, the greater the impact of psychological factors is likely to be . A variety of tests can be used to categorize and document personality and cognitive behavioral functioning, exempli gratia whether the patient manifests inappropriate symptom amplification or other psychological disorders . This is a comprehensive psychological test that characterizes hypochondriasis, depression and hysteria . Although psychological assessment is carried out as an integral part of the clinical evaluation of patients with chronic low back pain, more detailed assessment may be indicated if an individual is resistant to improvement . Gait assessment . High-heeled and/or loose-fitting shoes should be noted and the patient made aware of possible painful consequences of inadequate foot support . Neurological testing . The sequence of neurological testing is arbitrary . The Romberg test for peripheral neuropathy and balance can be performed at any time the patient is standing, or at the same time as gait or functional muscle tests . The Babinski test for upper motor neuron dysfunction can be performed in conjunction with the ankle jerk reflex test, or when vibratory sensation is tested . The patient can be tested seated or supine without stockings . Pain is a variable contributor, depending on its intensity and the patient's movement . Examination pointers . Diffuse pain is usually a function of pain severity . Hip joint pain is referred to the thigh and often to the knee . If when asked, or on the pain drawing, the patient indicates the location of pain in the proximal thigh and groin, there is a strong possibility that hip joint disease is the cause . Spinal nerve impingement and hip joint testing . The patient should be supine with the 'good' leg and knee extended on the examining table . Tight hamstring muscles, when stretched, can cause pain to be referred to the thighs, thus greatly reducing the usefulness of the test . A straight leg raise test with the patient seated that does not provoke radicular leg pain after the patient was strongly positive on the conventional supine straight leg raise test is considered to be an indicator of malingering or, perhaps more politely, gross exaggeration . The Lasègue test also detects lumbar nerve root impingements (Figure 1.11) . It is most useful for patients who cannot lie fully supine because of their back pain . The involved leg is supported and slowly extended to test for sciatic irritability . Although it is more difficult to measure the degree of leg raising, thereby making this test less precise, it still provides a useful alternative to the straight leg raise test for patients who could not otherwise be tested . Like the crossed straight leg test, the crossed femoral nerve stretch test has enhanced specificity for nerve root impingement . The key nerve roots that are usually tested first are . Muscle testing . The aim of muscle testing is to note muscle atrophy and to assess . muscle function . The patient can be readily monitored for pain, imbalance, arthropathies and deformities while assessing possible weakness . Functional muscle strength . The patient is then asked to stand on the toes of both feet . Manual muscle testing . The muscle groups tested functionally can also be evaluated by manual muscle tests, which are particularly valuable for patients who cannot perform the functional tests . The patient is asked to resist the examiner's pressure . The muscle groups tested are a function of the patient's symptoms . Those most readily tested are . Manual muscle strength testing is at best a subjective evaluation, depending on the examiner's grading in conjunction with the patient's cooperation . Clinical assessment . ","'Red flags' are a set of findings that suggest that back pain is non-mechanical and may be due to fracture, malignancy, infection or systemic inflammatory disease The visual analog scale (VAS) is a simple linear scale to measure pain intensity and response to therapy. The pain drawing provides a simple way for the patient to indicate the region of the pain and often suggest etiology. A classic example involves groin tenderness as a marker of probable hip joint disease rather than a back-referred disorder. Ergonomic factors should be assessed, and this can often be readily done by observing the patient's movement in the clinic and during examination. Palpation of key painful areas of the spine, facet joint areas, iliac crests, buttocks (sciatic outlet - piriformis region) and trochanteric bursae will often indicate the nature of the pain and/or significant areas of referred pain that may respond to different forms of therapy. The patient's gait and body motion can be observed in the clinic to detect sciatic scoliosis; short leg; hip, knee or foot arthritis or weakness; and/or foot drop as markers of relevant pathology."
9781910797853,chp3,"The incidence of AML increases with age (Figure 3.1) . The fact that AML predominantly affects elderly patients, who may not be tolerant of intensive treatment, has major implications for management . AML is more likely to be diagnosed in developed countries and is more common in whites than in other groups . Mortality from AML is highest among people aged 75-84 years: 51% of AML deaths in the UK each year are in people aged 75 and over (2012-2014) . In the UK in 2014, AML accounted for 2% of all cancer deaths . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia . The number of new cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 1.7 per 100 000 men and women per year in the USA between 2010 and 2014, and there were 760 new cases in the UK in 2014 . ALL commonly affects younger people, with over 50% of patients being under the age of 20 (see Figure 3.1) . The median age of diagnosis is 15 years . Chronic myeloid leukemia . The incidence of CML increases with age (see Figure 3.1), with the median age of diagnosis being 64 years . The 5-year relative survival rate increased from 17% in 1975 to 64% in 2009 . Chronic lymphocytic leukemia . The incidence of CLL increases with age (see Figure 3.1), and the median age of diagnosis is 70 years . There is a slight predominance of white male patients . There also appears to be an increased risk of developing CLL and other lymphoid malignancies in patients with relatives who have CLL; there is an 8.5-fold risk of developing CLL if a relative also has CLL . Etiology and risk factors . Like most cancers, the main risk factor for AML, CML and CLL is age, and so with an aging population the prevalence of these conditions increases . Many different gene mutations can lead to leukemia . Both AML and B-cell ALL can be subtyped on the basis of recurrent genetic mutations (see Chapter 2) . The presence of pre-existing populations of cells that place individuals at risk for developing leukemia has also long been recognized . This suggests that in some patients, RUNX1-ETO fusion occurs in utero, and pre-dates the development of frank leukemia . The risk of developing AML from MDS is highly variable: prediction can be based on a number of scoring systems . The risk of developing AML affects the overall survival of patients with MDS . Patients with MBL are asymptomatic and have no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly . In a prospective study of over 77 000 apparently healthy people over 60 years old, 45 patients eventually developed CLL . In virtually all cases, a preceding diagnosis of MBL was identified . In one study in which exome sequencing was performed in over 12 000 patients without hematologic malignancies, 10% of patients over the age of 65 had at least one mutation suggesting clonal hematopoiesis . These findings have many implications, including how these results are explained to patients and how they should be monitored . Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of both ALL and AML . The risk differs according to age, and is greatest in early childhood . However, a subset of patients with TAM subsequently develop AML . All patients with TAM have an N-terminal-truncating mutation in the transcription factor gene GATA1 . The accumulation of other gene mutations, including those that encode the cohesin complex, results in the development of AML (Figure 3.2) . Inherited predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia . As described above, most cases of AML are sporadic, arising as a result of the steady accumulation of mutations in somatic cells . However, a small but increasingly well-recognized subset of patients with AML have a germline inherited genetic predisposition to AML . An example of one such group of disorders encompasses patients with mutations in the transcription factor GATA2 gene . In these patients, germline heterozygous mutations in GATA2 result in a predisposition to MDS and AML . Patients may develop secondary AML after chemotherapy or radiotherapy for other malignancies . These forms of AML are known as therapy-associated AML and patients tend to have adverse-risk cytogenetics . ","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Age is the main risk factor for AML, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); the prevalence of these leukemias increases with age. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) most commonly affects younger people; over 50% of patients with ALL are under 20 years of age. The main risk factor for AML, CML and CLL is age, with recurrent genetic mutations accumulating over time. Predisposing conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis increase the risk of AML and CLL, respectively. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is present in up to 10% of the population aged over 65. Although this increases the risk of hematologic malignancies, most individuals with CHIP do not develop a hematologic disorder. Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of AML and ALL. The risk is greatest in early childhood, when transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) develops. However, TAM spontaneously remits in most cases; only about 10% of cases, with additional genetic mutations, go on to develop AML. Although most cases of AML are sporadic, arising from the steady accumulation of genetic mutations with age, some individuals have a germline inherited genetic predisposition to the disease. Environmental exposures to chemicals such as benzene, high-dose ionizing radiation and previous chemotherapy increase the risk of leukemia to varying degrees."
9781910797181,ch04,"Early smoking experiences . The irritancy of nicotine and other components of smoke in the airways usually causes coughing and sore throat on initial exposure . Some first-time smokers experience a pleasurable sensation as well . Adaptation to the acute unpleasant effects of smoking occurs quickly, and within a few weeks or months novice smokers are able to tolerate as much nicotine from each cigarette as habitual smokers . Long-term health effects of smoking . Those who are killed by smoking die an average of 20 years sooner than they would have done otherwise . Smoking also causes long-term disability, both in those who are eventually killed by cigarette smoking and in those who ultimately die from some other cause . The average smoker who fails to stop can expect to develop diseases of old age many years earlier than a non-smoker . The following sections discuss some of the more common causes of death associated with smoking . Smoking accounts for the vast majority of cases of lung cancer worldwide . The risk of lung cancer is 15 times greater for a smoker than for a non-smoker . The risk accumulates over time and is related to both daily cigarette consumption and duration of smoking . Both are usually caused by smoking . Unlike the risk for lung cancer, cardiovascular risk is not directly proportional to overall smoke exposure . Approximately half the increased risk occurs even with very light smoking, and the risk curve flattens somewhat above about 10 cigarettes per day . Even non-daily smokers incur significant cardiovascular risk . Recent research has found that smoking as few as three cigarettes per day increases the risk of heart attack . Multiple studies have shown immediate and dramatic drops in heart attacks among non-smokers when smoking is banned in public places . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is, like lung cancer, relatively uncommon in non-smokers in western countries . Other life-threatening diseases . Even now, science is discovering new contributions that smoking makes to diseases not initially considered related to smoking . There was a view in the 1990s that smoking was protective against Alzheimer's disease . We now know that smoking is an important risk factor for both Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's dementia . Non-life-threatening diseases . The number of disorders known to be linked to smoking is growing . Smoking can also have an effect on various treatment regimens or medical conditions . Smoking and reproduction . It is widely known that maternal smoking during pregnancy reduces birth weight . The mechanism linking smoking with these consequences has not been clearly established . Fertility is impaired by smoking in both women and men . Smoking is also an important cause of miscarriage, the risk being several times higher than in non-smokers when other known risk factors are controlled for . Children of smokers are more likely to suffer from intellectual impairment and behavioral problems and delinquency, although we cannot be sure that smoking is the cause . Effects of nicotine . Nicotine does not cause cancer . Larger doses produce larger effects . In the brain, nicotine has a wide range of both acute and chronic effects . At smoking doses it initially increases ACh release in the cortex and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens . Acute effects of stopping smoking . Nicotine increases the heart rate acutely; it decreases again when nicotine is eliminated from the body . Another 'offset effect' is an increase in skin temperature . Smoking also leads to an increase in tremor, due to a nicotine-induced increase in sympathetic activation . When smokers abstain, the tremor reduces to normal . The cause is not known, and the effect is relatively uncommon, but when it occurs it can cause considerable discomfort . It is probably unrelated to nicotine . Some smokers report coughs and sore throats when they stop smoking . Some smokers are very concerned about putting on weight if they quit smoking . It seems to deter many people from attempting to stop smoking . However, there is no clear evidence that stopping smoking places smokers at greater risk of developing depression . However, current evidence demonstrates that smoking does not actually help to reduce the stress . There is some evidence for a brief increase in anxiety when smokers stop smoking, but anxiety and stress levels soon fall to below their smoking level . The greatest benefit is achieved in those who stop while they are relatively young, and before they develop a smoking-related disease, but all smokers stand to gain by quitting . ","Smoking causes substantial mortality and morbidity, killing an estimated 6 million people worldwide each year. The main causes of death from smoking are lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking also increases the risk of a wide range of disabling conditions, such as age-related blindness, deafness and dementia. Smoking impairs fertility and increases the risk of fetal and neonatal death. Stopping smoking reduces the risks; a healthy smoker who stops before 35 years of age has a near-normal life expectancy. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and acts, among other things, as a central nervous system stimulant. Nicotine at the level associated with smoking has relatively few adverse health effects and does not cause cancer. Smoking cessation causes temporary withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability, restlessness, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating and increased appetite. Many smokers experience permanent weight gain when they stop smoking."
9781910797495,chp1,"Developments in pain management . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy appears poised to achieve the Holy Grail of pain assessment: sensitive specific diagnosis of the presence of chronic pain using a quick simple laboratory test . Defining pain . As understanding of the cellular mechanisms of pain has increased, proposals have been advanced to classify pain according to the predominant pathophysiological mechanism thought to be involved . This plasticity is fundamental to the understanding of both the perpetuation of pain in some pain syndromes and the mechanisms of action of pain treatment modalities . There is large variability in the neuroplasticity response among individuals, and this accounts for the large variability in pain response . For example, after surgery or trauma some patients suffer much higher than average acute pain levels . Importantly, these are the people who are at high risk of progression to persistent (chronic) pain . Mental health problems such as anxiety and depression also place sufferers at increased risk of developing chronic pain, while those with chronic pain are prone to develop new anxiety or depression . Mechanisms of pain . Peripheral sensitization and heightened afferent activity in pain fibers elicit functional, chemical and anatomic reorganization in spinal cord neurons . Pain also triggers processes that dampen the perception of nociceptive stimuli . Pain is more than the nociceptive cascade described above . Because it is an experience, pain itself cannot be measured directly . Central to the understanding of clinical pain is the concept that pain may be present without an obvious peripheral source or cause . Mechanisms of neuropathic pain . Patients often complain not only of spontaneous pain, but also of pain from stimuli that are not normally painful (allodynia) . For example, a light touch may be described as painful . Those pain syndromes that have unique pathogenic mechanisms are discussed in the relevant chapters . Central effects of peripheral nerve injury . Reorganization of neurons . In addition, nerve injury triggers glial activation . Thus, new treatments for chronic neuropathic pain could focus on the cause of the ongoing pain - overactive glia . Increased glial cell activity normally subsides gradually after injury; its continuation in some patients may be one of the keys to 'what goes wrong in chronic pain' . Genetics and pain . Variability in pain response . People report almost ninefold variability in pain intensity in response to a standardized stimulus . This variability is reflected in the degree of activation of 'pain' areas of the brain, such as the anterior cingulate gyrus and somatosensory area 1 . The marked individual variation in GCH1 activity and NO release correlated with the pain intensity experienced and the risk of developing persistent pain . Specific single gene-related abnormalities in pain experience have been identified in humans . Individuals with such mutations had a complete congenital inability to experience pain . It may be of interest in the future to determine whether polymorphisms of SCN9A can produce not only the complete inability to experience pain but also interindividual variation in response to a standardized pain stimulus . Memory and pain . There is strong evidence that learning and memory processes play a key role in determining which patients progress from acute to chronic pain, and continue to experience chronic pain . However, in patients with chronic neuropathic pain, extinction processes may be impaired . Training the patient to extinguish pain-related memory processes may be a crucial but difficult key to treatment . The brain and pain . New sophisticated methods of brain imaging have identified key regions associated with pain and have provided strong evidence that neuroplasticity changes in the brain are associated with chronic pain and accompanying physical dysfunction in humans . It is notable that old concepts of a spinothalamic 'pain pathway' provided a very incomplete picture . the degree of unpleasantness associated with pain stimuli correlated closely with activation of the ACC and S . This study provided neural correlates of individual differences in the subjective experience of pain . In patients who have had a spinal cord injury (SCI), the neuroplastic changes are much greater in those who experience pain than in those with no pain . There is also a correlation between S neuroplastic changes and pain in those who experience pain with the SCI (Figure 1.10) . This progression of acute to chronic pain and its complications is termed 'chronification' (Figure 1.11) . Likewise, to address the public health problem of chronic pain, health systems must be designed to promote the prevention of chronification . ","The nervous system is dynamic and plastic; noxious stimuli trigger biological processes that lead to amplification or inhibition of the noxious signal. Nociceptive input activates descending pathways that inhibit spinal noxious transmission. These descending pathways are potential targets for analgesic drugs. Neuropathic pain is produced by a lesion of the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). Nerve injury produces hyperexcitability and spontaneous generation of ectopic impulses in axons and neurons. Ectopic peripheral nerve activity contributes to the central hyperexcitable state and enlargement of neuronal receptive fields. After nerve injury there may be a loss of spinal inhibition control resulting from loss of neuronal inhibitory processes and persistence of glia-induced neuronal hypersensitivity. The connectivity of sympathic fibers to injured neurons contributes to the activation of pain by stress. All three of these maladaptions may play a major role in chronic neuropathic pain. Increased understanding of chronic pain pathophysiology is leading to new pharmacological targets for treatment. Increased understanding of the causal pathway from acute to chronic pain (chronification), provides targets for early preventive interventions following onset of pain-causing injury or disease. New imaging (especially of the brain) is increasing knowledge of pathophysiological CNS neuroplasticity changes and showing the effects of biobehavioral training to reverse these changes."
9781910797433,ch02,"Traditionally, it was believed that ovarian cancers usually originated in the surface epithelium of the ovaries . Although this theory supports the genesis of low-grade serous carcinoma, recent studies indicate that high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most common histological subtype of ovarian cancer, originates in the fimbria of the fallopian tubes (Figure 2.1) . Precancerous lesions, called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) have been found on the fimbria in 5-10% of women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations undergoing risk-reducing surgery and in up to 60% of unselected women with pelvic HGSC . For this reason, the term 'ovarian cancer' should be considered a collective term that covers all ovarian-fallopial tube and primary peritoneal cancers . Ovarian cancer cells tend to exfoliate into the peritoneum, where circulation of peritoneal fluid distributes them to the peritoneal surfaces and omentum . Indeed, intraperitoneal dissemination is the most characteristic feature of ovarian cancer; malignant cells can implant anywhere in the peritoneal cavity, particularly at sites of stasis within the peritoneal fluid circulation system . lymphatic invasion . The World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of epithelial ovarian cancer is summarized in Figure 2.2 . Epithelial tumors are the most common form of ovarian cancer, and the main focus of this book . The WHO classification for other forms of ovarian cancer are summarized in Table 2.1 and discussed in Chapter 9 . Epithelial tumors include benign, borderline and malignant histologies . Borderline tumors are a separate tumor entity characterized by complex papillary architecture, stratified epithelium with tufting (apparent detachment of cell clusters from their sites of origin), moderate nuclear abnormalities and moderately increased mitotic activity; in contrast to malignant tumors, they do not show stromal invasion . The pathological characteristics of borderline tumors are . Epithelial cancers account for 80-90% of all malignant ovarian neoplasms,, of which HGSCs account for 70-74%, endometrioid tumors for 7-24% and clear cell carcinomas for 10-26% (Figure 2.3) . Low-grade serous tumors are believed to originate from benign ovarian cysts, and to develop via a borderline epithelial tumor to form an invasive tumor . These are indolent, slow-growing tumors that usually respond poorly to platinum-based chemotherapy . Although they are usually fatal, prolonged survival may be achievable in some patients . High-grade serous tumors are more common than low-grade tumors, and are believed to develop from STICs (see above) . These are aggressive tumors that initially respond well to platinum-based therapy, but typically recur . ","Increasing evidence suggests that serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) in the fallopian tube are the most common precursor lesions of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common type of epithelial ovarian cancer. Intraperitoneal dissemination is the most characteristic feature of ovarian cancer. Borderline ovarian tumors constitute a separate tumor entity and can present with the same histological subgroups as the invasive form of the disease."
9781912776153,chp4,"Sudden cardiac death (SCD), also known as sudden cardiac arrest, continues to represent a significant healthcare problem . There are more than 350 000 deaths every year from sudden cardiac arrest in the USA, accounting for more than 50% of all cardiovascular causes of death in the USA, and it is estimated that 6 million die from it annually worldwide . With increasing recognition of the condition and rapid application of resuscitation by bystanders, more people are surviving and making it to hospital . As a result, the overall survival rates of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have increased dramatically, particularly in some parts of the world, such as Seattle, where survival rates have increased significantly . SCD is defined according to whether it was witnessed or not . If it was witnessed, unexpected death must have occurred within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms; if it was not witnessed, unexpected death must have occurred within 24 hours of the patient last being observed without symptoms . There are many potential causes of SCD (Table 4.1) . SCD usually occurs in individuals with underlying cardiac disease and occurs more frequently with male sex and increasing age . In patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular or myocardial abnormalities, SCD can be the first presentation of the patient . An acute coronary syndrome can lead to ventricular fibrillation (VF) in a patient not previously known to have cardiac disease . Alternatively, a patient who has had coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the past may present years later with a new ischemic event leading to SCD . Metabolic causes associated with SCD include electrolyte abnormalities, and drugs and medication can also cause fatal rhythm disturbances (see Chapter 10) . An increasing number of syndromes are recognized as being associated with SCD . The major cause of sudden death in advanced countries remains ischemic and hypertensive heart disease . Sudden cardiac death in the young . A structural abnormality, usually secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is present in the majority (80%) of younger patients (aged <= 35 years) affected by SCD . Coronary artery anomalies occur rarely . Postmortem examination often reveals no evidence of demonstrable cardiac pathology; the death of the patient is often classified as of unknown etiology . Indeed, sudden death is often the sentinel event, and postmortem examination is required to determine the cause of death . Although this may reveal a non-cardiac cause, such as asthma, epilepsy or pulmonary embolism, SCD is the principal cause of sudden death in young people, and structural cardiovascular abnormalities are often evident on postmortem examination . Sudden unexplained death . Not infrequently, there are no causes found either before or after an episode of SCD to explain why the patient collapsed and required resuscitation . In these patients, infrequent or rare syndromes, such as long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, Brugada syndrome or repolarization abnormalities, were undiagnosed or unknown to the patients . There are also patients who have idiopathic VF where no cause is apparent . All of these patients receive a defibrillator . Catheter ablation is also emerging as a treatment option in patients with Brugada syndrome (see Chapter 11) . Genetic testing should include blood samples of family members of patients who have survived an unexplained cardiac arrest . If patients do not survive a cardiac arrest, a molecular postmortem examination, consisting of blood and tissue samples, should be carried out whenever possible . Resuscitation and hospital care after cardiac arrest . Modern acute coronary care units and intensive care facilities are well prepared for the patient arriving following a cardiac arrest or with a return of spontaneous circulation . R esponse - is the person conscious? . A irway - is the person's airway clear/is the person breathing? . B reathing - check the person is breathing . CPR - administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation . Bystanders to patients with SCD can start resuscitation measures, and in some communities new smartphone software alerts individuals who are able to give such help that a cardiac arrest has occurred near their location . Electrical storm . Typically, a patient is admitted after receiving multiple shocks from their defibrillator, but patients may be under monitoring following an admission to hospital and require repeated defibrillation due to electrical instability . These patients are at particularly high risk of dying, and require immediate therapeutic measures . ","Sudden cardiac death (SCD) represents a significant healthcare problem, accounting for more than 350 000 deaths in the USA alone every year, and an estimated 6 million deaths annually worldwide. SCD is defined according to whether it was witnessed or not. If witnessed, unexpected death must have occurred within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms; if not, unexpected death must have occurred within 24 hours of the patient last being observed without symptoms. SCD usually occurs in individuals with underlying cardiac disease and occurs more frequently with male sex and increasing age. In SCD in those aged under 35 years, approximately 80% have a structural abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, very rarely coronary artery anomalies. Other causes include: metabolic (such as electrolyte abnormalities); drugs and medication; genetic syndromes such as primary electrical disorders or channelopathies. The overall survival rates of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have increased dramatically for reasons including: increasing recognition of the condition; more widespread adoption of high-performance cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by emergency medical personnel; increased rates of CPR training for local residents; emergency services personnel giving CPR instructions to bystanders by phone; and increasing public access to automated external defibrillators as a result of their being carried in police and fire service vehicles."
9781905832729,ch_4,"Mixed incontinence refers to the coexistence of stress incontinence with urgency incontinence symptoms . SUI suggests a problem with the bladder outlet . SUI is often divided etiologically, especially in women, into SUI due to urethral hypermobility and that due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) . In surveys of older women, mixed and urgency incontinence predominate, whereas stress incontinence is generally the dominant symptom in young and middle-aged women . Most women manage UI on their own, with the minority (30-45%) seeking medical help . It is generally agreed that the prevalence is less than half that in women . Management in women . Pelvic floor muscle exercises . The pelvic floor muscles support the bladder neck, rectum and vagina (Figure 3.1) . Exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor, and therefore improve support of the bladder neck, were first described by Dr Arnold Kegel in 1948 . The aims are to promote patient awareness and to improve the contractility and coordination of pelvic floor muscles, especially in women with weak pelvic floor muscles . Exercise regimens concentrate on both contraction strength and muscle endurance . A pelvic floor muscle assessment should be performed to ensure correct technique . Improvement should be observed within 2-4 months . Weighted vaginal cones can help women to identify the muscles of the pelvic floor (Figure 3.3) . Subjective improvement rates can be as high as 70% . Pharmacological treatment . Duloxetine hydrochloride is a combined serotonin and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor which is approved in Europe for the treatment of stress incontinence in women . It may be more effective if combined with pelvic floor muscle exercises . Surgery for stress incontinence in women should be considered only after the cause of the incontinence has been definitely ascertained . Women need to be adequately counseled about the risks and benefits of surgery for stress incontinence so that they can make an informed decision before embarking on this sort of surgery . Surgery for stress incontinence has changed over the last 10 years with the advent of minimally invasive techniques . The principle underlying the procedure is that stress incontinence is caused by failure of the pubourethral ligaments . The sling provides support (basically a backboard) under the urethra without lifting it from its anatomic position . Other complications can include erosion of the mesh through the vagina and urethra . Other types of sling are also available . It is worth noting that complication rates are higher with tapes made from materials other than polypropylene . Colposuspension provides long-term cure in 70-80% of women at 10 years . Most would agree that sling insertion or colposuspension should be postponed for women who want to have more children . Other procedures . Historically a number of other operations have been used to treat stress incontinence in women . Stamey procedure . Patients may be unable to pass urine or completely empty their bladders for days or weeks after surgery . Detrusor overactivity, causing urgency, frequency and urgency incontinence, may be precipitated or worsened as a result of surgery for stress incontinence, particularly in women with bladder outlet obstruction . It is therefore important that women with mixed symptoms receive adequate counseling before consenting to surgery . Stress incontinence after radical prostatectomy usually improves spontaneously . Initial management involves strengthening the pelvic floor musculature with exercises (see Table 3.3) . Most patients improve over a period of weeks or months without the need for further investigation or treatment . Any patient who is still experiencing incontinence 12 months after prostatectomy should have their sphincter function investigated urodynamically . injection of bulking agents into the sphincter . insertion of an artificial urinary sphincter . Injectable bulking agents can be used to treat male stress incontinence . This minimally invasive procedure involves placing a minimally compressive sling at the level of the bulbar urethra . Artificial urinary sphincter . When the sphincter is activated, the patient has to learn to use the sphincter by compressing the pump that causes the cuff to empty . Urinary incontinence . ","Stress incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine on exertion. It is far more common in women than in men. Risk factors for stress incontinence in women include pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and obesity. Prostatectomy is the main cause in men. Behavioral modification, including pelvic floor muscle exercises, is effective in women and men when taught correctly, and a number of devices are available to assist with training. The surgical procedure of choice in women is insertion of a retropubic or transobturator tape mid-urethral sling to provide support for the urethra. Other alternatives in women are colposuspension and injection of bulking agents. Options for management in men include injection of bulking agent into the urethral sphincter, insertion of a perineal sling or artificial urinary sphincter."
9781910797433,ch04,"As outlined in Chapter 1, the majority of women with ovarian cancer (> 80%) are not diagnosed until the disease has reached an advanced stage . The initial diagnostic pathway of epithelial ovarian cancer is based on the assessment of symptoms and overall clinical picture, biomarkers (particularly CA125), family history and imaging . Although ovarian cancer has previously been considered a 'silent killer', it is now recognized that a high proportion of women have symptoms before diagnosis . The most common symptoms are vague and non-specific, resembling irritable bowel syndrome, and hence a diagnosis of ovarian cancer may be missed (Table 4.1) . In general, further evaluation may be appropriate in a patient with severe or frequent symptoms of recent onset . Symptom indices have been developed in attempts to improve the sensitivity and specification of symptoms for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer . The most common of these is the Goff index, which is considered positive if any of the following symptoms are present more than 12 times a month but have developed within the previous 12 months . The Goff index has a sensitivity of approximately 67% for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and a specificity of approximately 90% . However, the clinical usefulness of such indices depends on how the index is used (higher specificities are achieved when information about symptoms is obtained from clinical notes or questionnaires, rather than by telephone interview), and how index-positive patients are managed . The ongoing ROCkeTS (Refining Ovarian Cancer Test Accuracy Scores) study in the UK aims to validate risk prediction models that estimate the probability of having ovarian cancer for post- and premenopausal women with suspected ovarian cancer, and to define thresholds of predicted risk that inform decisions for patient management . The most established biomarker for ovarian cancer is CA125, the levels of which mainly increase in the later stages of the disease . As a result, CA125 has only limited sensitivity (40-50%) for early-stage ovarian cancer . A more recent tumor marker is the human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4), which is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer . This is used in combination with CA125 and menopausal status in the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA), which predicts the presence of ovarian cancer in patients with a pelvic mass, with a specificity and sensitivity of up to 95% and 76.4%, respectively; specificity is higher in postmenopausal women . Over all ages, ROMA correctly classified 93.8% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer as being at high risk . Prospectively acquired evidence from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS) - which applied serial CA125 measurements interpreted via the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) - has shown that screening with this algorithm doubles the number of screen-detected epithelial ovarian cancers, compared with a fixed CA125 cut-off of 35 IU/mL . As a result, defined cut-offs need to be used with caution and always interpreted within the context of the whole clinical picture . A greater focus on interpreting trends in CA125 levels, along with the clinical picture and imaging findings, is likely to define the standard of care in the future . The ability of current imaging techniques to accurately depict lesions in the peritoneum is limited, especially in fine nodular disease . This represents a significant challenge in diagnosing low-volume disease and accurately describing intra-abdominal tumor dissemination patterns . Nevertheless, CT has a well-established role in diagnosing bulky (> 1 cm) lymphadenopathy, distant intraparenchymatous metastatic lesions and additional lesions such as secondary cancers and thromboembolic events that have a significant effect on patient management . Complete surgical staging of ovarian cancer is essential to accurately define the stage of the disease and determine appropriate adjuvant treatment . Up to 30% of patients with apparent early disease will be upstaged after comprehensive staging . The staging system of the International Federation of Gynecological Oncology (FIGO) is shown in Figure 4.2 . Having an accurate FIGO stage will influence the treatment strategies that are most appropriate for the individual patient . The grade of ovarian cancer reflects the degree of distortion from the normal tissue architecture and can correlate with aggressiveness and prognosis . Grade 1: well-differentiated tissue . Grade 2: moderately differentiated tissue . Grade 3: poorly differentiated tissue . Serous tumors are often graded as high or low grade (see Chapter 2) . ","The majority (> 80%) of women with epithelial ovarian cancer will become apparent and diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease. There are no reliable imaging tools to accurately describe the stage of the disease or tumor dissemination patterns, especially in fine nodular peritoneal carcinomatosis and microscopically involved lymph nodes. Comprehensive surgical staging accurately defines the disease stage, resulting in more reliable prediction of prognosis and more appropriate management strategies and systemic treatment."
9781912776696,hh-5,"Treatment differences are usually expressed as a hazard ratio (HR) . Hazard rate is the probability that a subject will die within a given time interval among the subjects alive in that treatment group at the start of that interval . In a group of 1000 patients, suppose 10 die in month 1, 15 die in month 2 and 12 die in month 3 . The hazard rate for month 1 = 10/1000 . The hazard rate for month 2 = 15/990 . The hazard rate for month 3 = 12/975 and so on . In practice, hazard rates can be calculated for smaller time periods and the hazard rate can be considered as a continuous measure . Figure 2.4 shows two hypothetical hazard rate curves that correspond to active (treatment) and control (placebo) groups . Although hazard rates are never constant over time, in many cases (at least approximately) the ratio of the hazard rates, id est the hazard rate for an event in the active group divided by the hazard rate for an event in the control group, will be approximately constant . What do hazard ratios tell us? By convention, the hazard rate for the active group is divided by the hazard rate for the control group . HR = 1: the hazard rate in the active group is identical to that in the control group . HR < 1: the hazard rate in the active group is, on average, lower than that in the control group . HR > 1: the hazard rate in the active group is, on average, higher than that in the control group . While it is possible to compare the survival of patients in two different study groups at any given point in time on the Kaplan-Meier curves, this does not provide a comparison of the total survival experience of the two groups . The logrank test provides a p -value for the total survival experience of the treatment group compared with the control group by comparing the two Kaplan-Meier curves . Note that a constant HR manifests itself as Kaplan-Meier curves that start together at time zero but then separate out gradually with time (see Figure 2.2 for an example where this is the case) . Restricted mean survival time . The restricted mean survival time (RMST) is the mean survival time up to a certain point of follow-up, for example 10 years . Life expectancy difference . If the HR does not provide a suitable measure of treatment effect, for example if the HR is not constant, then a treatment difference can be expressed as the difference between two RMST values (the active RMST minus the control RMST) . This is calculated as the area between the two Kaplan-Meier curves (Figure 2.6) . Any differences in outcomes between the two groups are then attributed to the difference in treatments . There are two ways to make such adjustments for time-to-event endpoints . Time to-event endpoints . Often these endpoints are measured from the time the participants in a study are randomized into treatment groups . Time-to-event analyses include information from both censored and uncensored observations (see below) . Censoring is a common feature of all time-to-event endpoints . A subject's time to event is said to be censored if the event of interest (death, disease progression etc . In a study with a fixed 24-month follow-up, a subject who is still alive at month 24 will provide a censored value for OS . At the time of an interim analysis, some subjects may not have been in the study for very long . These subjects will provide censored values if the event of interest has not occurred during the limited follow-up . Kaplan-Meier curves . Kaplan-Meier curves provide a way of plotting the distribution of a time-to-event endpoint . In Figure 2.1 the dashed line shows that at 24 months' follow-up the estimated survival probability is 54% . Kaplan-Meier survival curves are often used to compare the data between two groups of subjects . The Kaplan-Meier curve steps down at time points at which deaths occur, while censored observations are denoted by notches on the curve . In this study, the follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 74 months . The Kaplan-Meier curve plots the probability of being event free over time, with these probabilities being estimated from the data in the study . Median overall survival . The Kaplan-Meier curves can be used to obtain median survival times (Figure 2.3) . ","Typical examples of time-to-event analyses include overall survival, progression-free survival, disease-free survival and duration of response. Censoring is a common feature of all time-to-event endpoints. Observations are said to be censored when the event of interest has not happened by the end of the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier curves plot the probability of being event free over time. The curves from different treatment groups can be plotted against each other to show the differences in outcome. Treatment differences are often expressed as a hazard ratio (HR). An HR of 1 means the risk in the two groups is the same. An HR > 1 means that the risk in one group is higher than the other, and vice versa. The logrank test compares the two Kaplan-Meier curves to provide a p -value for the difference in total survival experience of the two groups. This test can only be used if there is a constant HR, id est the Kaplan-Meier curves start together at time zero and then separate out gradually with time. If the HR is not constant, a treatment difference can be expressed as the difference between two restricted mean survival times (which is equal to the area between two Kaplan-Meier curves). The stratified logrank and the Cox proportional hazards model are two ways of adjusting for imbalances in baseline factors. Baseline variables that are important prognostic factors (exempli gratia age and stage of disease) should be taken into consideration in all statistical analyses, even in randomized studies."
9781908541680,ch_10,"Three-quarters of obese children go on to become obese adults, carrying their risk factors and comorbidities with them as they grow . Postmortem studies on obese children who died from unrelated causes have revealed atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease . Of 86 children fulfilling the criteria there were . There is a strong genetic component, and if both parents are obese the risk is magnified . Lack of physical activity . Children are being conditioned to be inactive from infancy . Children's eating habits reflect those of adults, compounded by the promotion of unhealthy foods to children . Parents of obese or overweight children, who are usually themselves overweight or obese, can best help their children by engaging in a lifestyle modification program aimed at weight loss . Parental denial . Parents are notoriously poor at recognizing obesity in their offspring, and it is becoming increasingly difficult as mean childhood BMI increases, providing fewer 'normal' peers for comparison . Assessment should include . personal and family history of obesity and related conditions . physical activity and eating patterns . Examination should include height, weight and BMI . severe and progressive obesity before 2 years of age . Successful weight management is usually impossible without a stable and motivated family environment . Weight management . The usual weight management goals are either no further weight gain as height increases, or weight gain that is slower than height gain . However, children over 7 years old with obesity and/or complications may benefit from gradual weight loss of, for example, 0.5 kg per month . a balanced, varied diet for the whole family . smaller portions (children should not be given adult-sized portions) . Physical activity . Increasing sustainable physical activity is crucial in the management of childhood obesity . Any increase in activity will help . Develop an active lifestyle in the whole family . The elderly . Because of the decrease in skeletal muscle mass and the redistribution of body fat, the use of BMI to assess obesity in the elderly may be misleading . The risks of obesity in old age increase when the fat is predominantly visceral and when sarcopenia is also present; and this group of individuals are most affected by frailty and disability with increasing age . Being overweight or obese in young adulthood and underweight or obese in later life increases the risk of premature death in old age . Obesity-related diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, osteoarthritis and pulmonary disease are increasing in the elderly . Obesity-related disability . A high BMI is a strong predictor of long-term risk for mobility disability in older women, a risk that persists to very old age . The prevalence of type 2 diabetes increases progressively with age . Both high blood pressure and cardiovascular risk continue to be highly correlated with obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, even in old age . Obesity defined by BMI or waist circumference is associated with poorer cognition in the elderly . Obesity at midlife is associated with an increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease later in life, and clustering of vascular risk factors increases the risk in an additive manner . For overweight elderly individuals in good health, there is no good evidence to show that weight loss reduces mortality risk . In the overweight (but not obese) elderly, weight fluctuation in any direction and irrespective of intention, may increase the risk for mobility limitation . It is desirable to prevent weight gain, particularly among the obese, and weight loss, particularly among the non-obese . The North American Society of the Study of Obesity has taken the position that weight loss improves physical function and quality of life, and reduces the medical complications associated with obesity in older persons . Physical activity . Increased physical activity is essential and should be initiated at the outset . Benefits include improved overall well-being and function . It is most important that an active lifestyle is promoted from an early age and maintained through adulthood to prevent substantial weight gain and obesity with age . Although morbidity and mortality are increased in the elderly, the risk:benefit ratio may be acceptable in those who have severe obesity-related comorbidities and restricted mobility . The major risks of obesity to the pregnant woman and newborn are shown in Table 9.2 . As shown, most of these rise with increasing BMI . Restriction of weight gain in pregnancy increases the incidence of preterm birth in women with a normal BMI but not in women with a BMI above 26 kg/m . Physical activity . ",In childhood obesity the aim is usually to attenuate weight gain rather than induce weight loss. An elderly person at any given body mass index or waist circumference is always likely to have a higher percentage of fat. Pregnancy is a crucial stage both for the mother and the fetus in preventing and managing future obesity. Management of obesity is different for different age groups; individualization of care with informed patient choice is important. Weight loss is not always an appropriate outcome in an individual; overweight or obesity may provide a protective influence.
9781910797273,chp8,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a clinically heterogeneous condition, and the advice given must be tailored to the individual patient's disease phenotype, medical history and social circumstance . Patients are keen to know whether their life expectancy will be affected and whether the disease is transmissible to their children (Table 8.1) . Patients often ask if they could have avoided the disease by changing their behavior in any way . The medical team is important in coordinating multidisciplinary patient care . It is the neurologist's role to make a firm diagnosis as early as possible in the course of the disease . Once the diagnosis has been established, the neurologist must ensure that the patient is fully informed of all approved treatment options and understands both their benefits and risks . Neurologists are also well-positioned to provide patients with the opportunity to participate in local clinical trials of emerging disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies . Neurologists strive to understand more about the pathophysiology and evolution of MS, and translate this information to the clinical care of their patients . Studies show that patients with MS do not always seek specialty care; this results in lower use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and higher disability . The primary care provider will be able to coordinate all the threads of care for a patient with MS throughout their life . As care providers over a lifetime, they have a unique insight into the needs of the individual . It is vital patients are provided with consistent messages, including guidance on preventative care, smoking cessation, stress management, regular exercise and healthy nutrition . APCs are a reliable source of information about all aspects of MS, and can provide patients with practical advice on living with the condition . The APC can counsel people who have recently received a diagnosis of MS, and they are usually easy to contact when questions arise outside the consultation . After diagnosis, APCs are often the first port of call when a patient is concerned that they may be having a relapse . They can provide prompt clinical assessment and, where necessary, review . The MS specialist APC is well placed to explain the practical aspects associated with all DMTs . Finally, the APC helps patients deal with the social impact of MS and can provide a link to other services such as social workers and clinical psychologists . Physiotherapists are a valuable source of encouragement, and help to optimize the functional abilities of patients with MS, maintaining a range of movement and limb strength for as long as possible . They can aid communication in patients who have severe dysarthria, and also delineate the nature of swallowing problems in MS . The occupational therapist works with the patient to allow them to remain independent for as long as possible . The nutritionist can help plan a diet that is high in fiber to improve bowel function in patients with constipation . The risk of osteoporosis may increase in patients with MS, for which the dietitian can recommend a diet rich in calcium or, when required, supplements such as vitamin D and calcium . Patients may not always be aware of their entitlement, and for various reasons may struggle with completing forms . Rehousing to incorporate the needs of the patient and their family requires vital input from social workers . Patient rights - education and employment . It is therefore important that people with MS receive appropriate information and support to assist them to stay in education and employment for as long as possible . The specific diagnosis does not need to be disclosed to employers at interview (although disability will usually need to be) . In the UK, for example, employers must be informed of the diagnosis if employment is in the armed forces, on a plane or on a ship . Some employment contracts specifically request disclosure of diagnoses like MS, as most employers need to know about specific disabilities in order to adhere to the relevant laws in their country . Employers have an obligation to aid employees as much as possible to remain in employment . Functional capacity evaluation and neuropsychological testing can help determine the patient's limitations and strengths in relation to their condition to help plan for periods of disability . Even if there is little disability at the time of employment, employers will need to allow time off to recover from relapses or to attend hospital appointments . allowing the employee to work from home . providing longer break periods . providing ramps and wheelchair access . If a job involves driving, employers must be informed of the MS diagnosis . The driving authority may then contact the patient's doctor, and will decide whether they are suitable to drive on a case-by-case basis . ","Counseling can be helpful for all people with multiple sclerosis (MS): it will involve explaining the nature of the disease, the risks and benefits of therapy and the effect MS will have on all aspects of life, including career, family, travel and insurance. Common concerns raised by patients include life expectancy, heritability of the disease, long-term planning and effect of pregnancy. Healthcare teams need to stress the importance of overall health and wellness in MS given the known consequences of comorbidities in patients. A multidisciplinary team is important for the coordination of patient care, and comprises neurologists, primary care providers, specialist nurses, physician assistants, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, social workers, psychologists and continence nurses. Advanced practice clinicians (APCs) are a reliable source of information about all aspects of the condition. They have an important role in helping patients recognize the signs and symptoms of relapse, providing practical advice on living with MS and providing a link with other services. Concerns about employment can become a great source of stress. Employers have an obligation to aid people with MS as much as possible to remain in employment. Functional capacity evaluation and neuropsychological testing can help determine a person's employability."
9781912776276,chp2,"Psychotic symptoms are the result of particular interactions between medications and PD pathology . Medications used to treat the motor symptoms of PD, with the exception of the anticholinergic drugs, rarely cause psychosis when used in patients without PD . Furthermore, untreated PD patients only rarely develop psychotic symptoms . To date, almost all physiological studies of PDP have evaluated patients with visual hallucinations only, not other hallucinations or delusions, and it has yet to be elucidated whether particular brain structures or neurotransmitter alterations are involved . While almost all patients with PDP are on 'standard' medications for the treatment of motor symptoms, many are also on other psychoactive medications . The association between psychotic symptoms and dopamine stimulation, either via dopamine itself or dopamine agonists, is clear, but there is no general dose-response relationship . Hallucinations are not generally associated with ON responses to medications, when brain levels of dopamine are likely to be at their peak, or with the occurrence of dyskinesias, which are usually an indication of high serum levels of dopamine . Indeed, many patients report that the hallucinations only occur at night, on awakening or during the evening, when dopamine levels are likely to be lower, and less commonly during the day . Some patients do, however, report an association with high dopamine levels . None hallucinated in the hospital, indicating the complex nature of hallucinations . Problems with this theory include the, admittedly rare, reports of PDP in untreated patients and hallucinations in untreated patients with DLB, which many believe is simply a variant of PD and is often confused with it . In one study, 42% of patients with newly diagnosed PD who had never received any PD medications reported having had very minor and very transient psychotic symptoms months before the diagnosis; only 5% of an untreated age-matched control group without PD reported these . Serotonergic factors . At low doses, it reduces psychotic symptoms without worsening motor function . The involvement of serotonin in PDP also has some physiological support . An increase in 5HT2A receptors was also found in the temporal cortex of patients with PD who had visual hallucinations . Furthermore, the serotonin transporter polymorphism (5HTTLPR) has been shown to be associated with delusions in patients with DLB . Cholinergic factors . Patients with PD and DLB have a greater cholinergic deficit than those with Alzheimer's disease . Anticholinergic drugs induce PDP . There is an association between dementia and PDP . Patients with PDD have a larger cholinergic deficit than is seen in PD without dementia, and a larger deficit than is seen in Alzheimer's disease . Yet, patients with Alzheimer's disease are significantly less likely to develop hallucinations or psychosis than patients taking PD medications . A greater number of Lewy bodies have been found in the amygdala and parahippocampus of patients with PD who had visual hallucinations, but not in those who did not hallucinate . Neurochemical studies have demonstrated an association between hallucinations and reduced overall cholinergic function (as indicated by choline acetyltransferase) in the frontal and temporal cortex of patients with DLB . Amantadine causes the same psychotic symptoms as the dopaminergic and anticholinergic drugs . One study found no cortical volume differences between hallucinators and non-hallucinators, whereas others have found limbic and mesolimbic volume reductions, as well as atrophy in other regions . Connectivity studies comparing hallucinators and non-hallucinators have reported decreased and increased connectivity between areas of the brain involved in attention and visual processing . In a particularly creative study that used connectivity as a measure, the 'strength' of mental imagery was compared between normal controls and patients with PD with and without visual hallucinations . The hallucinators had the stronger responses . Genetic influences are likely, with some genetically determined forms of PD being both more and less associated with PDP (see Chapter 3) . The occurrence of hallucinations is largely dependent on the state of alertness . Visual processing abnormalities . The association between visual impairment and visual hallucinations underscores the importance of environment in the development of hallucinations . The phenomenology of visual hallucinations also indicates the variable nature of the underlying pathophysiology, as some patients only see their hallucinations in the dark and report that they resolve if they shine a light on them, whereas other patients report seeing the hallucinations only in the light . Functional MRI studies have demonstrated different responses to flashing lights or facial images in hallucinators compared to the responses of non-hallucinators, but numbers have been small and confirmatory studies are lacking . ","Psychosis is generally due to an interaction between PD medications and PD pathology. Although dopamine stimulation may cause Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), anticholinergics and amantadine cause identical symptoms. The importance of 5HT2A serotonin receptor stimulation is supported by the usefulness of pimavanserin as an antipsychotic drug. Visual hallucinations in PDP have been linked to alterations in visual circuitry in the brain in both functional MRI and MRI connectivity studies, as well as to alterations in both dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter circuits. Cholinergic mechanisms may be more important in both hallucinations and delusions arising in people with dementia with Lewy bodies. Psychotic symptoms are not simply related to drug levels in the brain; they also reflect the state of alertness."
9781910797211,ch03,"Parkinsonism is a clinical syndrome (Table 3.1) and may have a number of causes . Early motor and non-motor indicators . In suspected cases it is often helpful to ask patients what tasks they find difficult . Motor indicators . Swinging of arms, an automatic movement, may become impaired on the side affected by Parkinson's disease . Comparison of the patient's writing from the past with that drawn in the clinic may be useful .

The presence of an obvious tremor often leads both patients and their carers to suspect Parkinson's disease . It affects 70% of patients with Parkinson's disease and is the presenting feature in most cases . However, those presenting with akinetic-rigid parkinsonism may never have significant tremor . Parkinsonian tremor, while worrying and embarrassing for the patient, is generally a good sign in Parkinson's disease because it can presage a more benign course . However, the tremor itself may only partially respond to dopaminergic therapy . Some patients diagnosed with essential tremor may actually have dystonic tremor, which is associated with dystonic posturing of the limb . Such patients may be misdiagnosed with Parkinson's disease, but DaTSCAN (see page 56) is usually normal in these cases . It is the most disabling motor manifestation of Parkinson's disease . Carers may nudge patients to start them moving again . Many patients develop tricks to overcome the symptom, such as stepping over an inverted walking stick or marching to a rhythm . However, patients often complain of muscular stiffness and pain, which may be diffuse or localized to one limb or the trunk . Postural problems . The bent posture of Parkinson's disease is probably due to rigidity and muscle spasm, although other factors may contribute . Postural imbalance can be detected by the 'pull' test . The doctor stands behind the patient and applies a quick pull backwards to the front of the shoulders . Falls are common in late Parkinson's disease and are a major cause of morbidity . Non-motor-symptoms . A wide range of non-motor symptoms has been described in Parkinson's disease, all of which are likely to have a major effect on the health-related quality of life of patients . Before any drug treatment is started, more than 45% of patients may show a severe to very severe burden of non-motor symptoms regardless of motor impairment . The Movement Disorders Society has recently revised the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, incorporating a range of non-motor symptoms as well as retaining the central core motor features . Criteria for prodromal Parkinson's disease have also been suggested but only for use within a research framework . The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease remains primarily clinical; there are as yet no specific tests . Dopaminergic challenge . Approximately 20% of patients with parkinsonian symptoms exhibit little response to dopaminergic treatment . Imaging tests . substantia nigra hyperechogenicity was noted in 103 of 112 patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease . blinded the sonographer to the clinical diagnosis of 42 patients with Parkinson's disease and 35 controls . The value of SPECT scanning becomes evident in clinical trials involving patients with suspected Parkinson's disease; 4-14% of them have scans with no dopaminergic deficits . These individuals do not show a progressive decline in dopaminergic markers, suggesting that they do not have Parkinson's disease . This type of imaging also appears to correlate with the progression of Parkinson's disease . However, at present, it is unable to differentiate between Parkinson's disease, MSA and PSP . Other tests . chromosome testing for fragile X syndrome, which can present with tremor and ataxia that may mimic Parkinson's disease and MSA . Current opinion and guidelines recommend that all patients with a 'suspected' diagnosis of Parkinson's disease must be referred untreated to a specialist who can reliably differentiate between Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes . This is particularly important in patients with a large number of non-motor symptoms on the NMSQuest . ","Most cases of Parkinson's disease are recognizable at an early stage, but can be misdiagnosed if tremor is absent. Characteristic motor symptoms include tremor, bradykinesia, a hurried shuffling gait, freezing episodes, rigidity and a bent posture. Non-motor symptoms include depression, dementia, sleep disorders, bowel and bladder problems, fatigue, apathy and pain; although common, these symptoms are often overlooked. There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, but DaTSCAN with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is becoming widely available, and can help to support a clinical diagnosis. Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease show a significant and sustained response to dopaminergic agents. Brain imaging is not typically used to diagnose Parkinson's disease, but may help to rule out tumors, vascular disease and normal-pressure hydrocephalus; transcranial ultrasound scanning reveals characteristic hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra. All patients with a 'suspected' diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be referred untreated to a specialist who can reliably differentiate between Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes. A shared care strategy can then be implemented, with ongoing care by the primary care team."
9781910797006,ch05,"The features usually described are those of severe emphysema . Plain chest radiography . The most reliable radiographic signs of emphysema can be classified by their causes of overinflation, vascular changes and bullae . Overinflation of the lungs results in the following radiographic features . Vascular changes associated with emphysema result from loss of alveolar walls and are shown on the plain chest radiograph by . a reduction in the size and number of pulmonary vessels, particularly at the periphery of the lung . areas of transradiancy . Assessment of the vascular loss in emphysema clearly depends on the quality of the radiograph . This increase in pulmonary artery size is often associated with a rapid diminution in the size of the vessels as they branch into the pulmonary periphery . Although these measurements can be used to detect the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension, they cannot accurately predict the level of the pulmonary artery pressure and they are not felt to be particularly sensitive . CT scanning has been used to detect and quantify emphysema . Techniques can be divided into those that use visual assessment of low-density areas on the CT scan, which can be either semiquantitative or quantitative, and those that use CT lung density to quantify areas of low X-ray attenuation . These two techniques are usually employed to measure macroscopic or microscopic emphysema, respectively . Visual assessment of emphysema on CT scanning (Figure 5.2) reveals . areas of low attenuation without obvious margins or walls . attenuation and pruning of the vascular tree . abnormal vascular configurations . The sign that correlates best with areas of macroscopic emphysema is an area of low attenuation . It is possible to distinguish the various types of emphysema using HRCT, particularly when the changes are not severe . It is generally acceptable to select patients with upper lung zone emphysema for volume reduction surgery by visual inspection of an HRCT by an experienced radiologist and surgeon . If CT scanning is to be used to measure microscopic emphysema, care should be taken to standardize the scanning conditions, particularly the lung volume, and to calibrate the CT scanner, since these factors affect CT lung density . Patient factors (exempli gratia obesity) can also affect quantification of emphysema on CT; in such cases, patients can be asked to inhale to a certain lung volume using respiratory-gated CT . These techniques have not, as yet, been sufficiently standardized for use in clinical practice, but density measurements have been shown to correlate with morphometric measurements of distal airspace size in resected lungs . Assessment of CT lung density is currently being used in clinical trials to demonstrate progressive emphysema . Detection of bullae . Whether a bulla is detected on a chest radiograph depends on its size and the degree to which it is obscured by overlying lung . CT scanning is much more sensitive than plain chest radiography in detecting bullae and can be used to determine their number, size and position . Other features can be assessed on the CT scan including bone density, coronary artery calcification and pulmonary artery size . Echocardiography has been used to assess the right ventricle and to detect pulmonary hypertension in COPD . Nevertheless, an adequate examination can be achieved in 65-85% of patients with COPD . Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography has been used to assess the ejection flow dynamics of the right ventricle in patients with pulmonary hypertension . Although the pulsed-wave Doppler technique is useful in differentiating patients with an elevated pulmonary arterial pressure from those with normal pulmonary arterial pressure, it is not as accurate as the continuous-wave Doppler technique in assessing pulmonary arterial pressure . Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is the best technique for non-invasive evaluation of pulmonary arterial pressure; the tricuspid gradient assessed in this way can be used to calculate the right ventricular systolic pressure . where P RV and P RA are the right ventricular and right atrial pressures and v is the maximum velocity . The right atrial pressure is estimated from clinical examination of the jugular venous pressure . There is still debate as to whether this technique is sufficiently sensitive and reproducible to monitor longitudinal changes in pulmonary arterial pressure and the effects of therapeutic interventions, particularly in patients with COPD . ","No features on plain chest radiography are specific for COPD. The features usually described are those of severe emphysema, but no abnormality may be visible, even in patients with marked disability. CT scans can be used to quantify emphysema, either by visual assessment of high-resolution scanning or by CT lung density measurements. CT scanning is the best way to detect and assess bullous disease. CT scanning is the standard way to assess patients for volume reduction surgery. Echocardiography, particularly continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography, can be used to assess pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with COPD."
9781908541666,ch_8,"Treatment of people with type 2 diabetes requires consideration of several aspects of the patient's health, and the range of areas is summarized in Table 7.1 . Ideally, an individualized approach that considers the patient holistically is encouraged, with the patient becoming skilled in self-management of most aspects of their diabetes care . Each patient will have varying levels of diabetic complications, cardiovascular risk, risk from hypoglycemia and so on, and thus diabetes care should be tailored to individual needs . At diagnosis, the patient should be given simple and clear messages about diabetes and how it may affect health with regard to complications and cardiovascular risk . A sensitive approach, with interpretation of the patient's responses to each piece of information given, helps avoid the disempowerment, denial and fatalism that can be the response of some patients . Group education with discussion is often helpful and written information is useful as a record for the patient and to reinforce the information given verbally . Printed educational resources are often available from national diabetes patient advocacy and support bodies . Patients should be taught how to measure capillary blood glucose so they can monitor their control and detect and treat hyperglycemia . Dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the cornerstones of management in the patient with diabetes and are discussed in detail in chapter 8 . Glycemic targets . Drug therapy . If glucose monitoring or HbA 1c levels indicate suboptimal control, drug therapy needs to be considered . In this regard, it is quite useful in obese or overweight patients with higher fasting glucose levels when given at the evening meal . Metformin may also reduce appetite in some patients, which helps with weight reduction; this action is being studied . For patients experiencing adverse effects, the dose should be halved and lowered further if symptoms do not resolve . Metformin doses should be lowered in renal disease . It should be avoided in patients with raised creatinine and heart failure as it can precipitate lactic acidosis . Specialist societies and diabetes associations around the world now recognize the importance of tailoring diabetes medications to the needs of the patient and the characteristics of their obesity . These are useful in reducing the pill burden when patients are receiving multiple medications for other medical conditions . Patients receiving sulfonylureas require education about hypoglycemia, which can be severe in some people . Patients need to be warned not to skip meals if they have taken their sulfonylurea . Likewise, patients should be asked to report symptoms of hypoglycemia as dose reduction may be necessary . There is also an increased risk of fracture . Insulin therapy (see Chapter 6) is frequently required in type 2 diabetes mellitus . In type 2 diabetes, insulin can be given as a long-acting single dose before bedtime . Other dosing regimens include twice daily premixed insulin for older patients or a basal-bolus regimen for patients who can manage a more complex insulin dosing regimen . Patient monitoring will indicate the success of insulin addition . Care should be taken to ensure patients are well educated in hypoglycemia detection and treatment and that overnight hypoglycemia does not occur . This is a particular issue in older patients who have underlying cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease . In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, consideration should be given to obesity-management strategies, including bariatric surgery (see chapter 8) . Other management targets . Smoking cessation is critical in reducing macrovascular disease in patients with diabetes . Patients who smoke should be supported with psychological strategies and, where appropriate, drug therapy to stop smoking . Blood pressure should ideally be normalized in patients with diabetes . Lipid-lowering therapy . Risk reduction includes lifestyle management (including diet, weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation and blood pressure control) . Fibrate therapy is indicated in those patients with predominant hypertriglyceridemia for whom lifestyle modification has not normalized triglyceride levels . Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) at a low dose should be considered in all patients with type 2 diabetes for its cardioprotective effects . Inflexibility also leads to rebellious behaviors by patients, often to their metabolic detriment . The detrimental impact of these events can be avoided by early identification and active intervention by healthcare professionals working with patients to re-establish optimal glucose control . These programs can help patients and their clinicians examine patterns in blood glucose levels . ","Type 2 diabetes management requires patient education on the fundamentals of self-care, including monitoring of glucose levels, dietary management - with an emphasis on weight reduction in the overweight or obese - increased physical activity and reduced sedentariness. Medications are often required for glucose control. There are multiple classes of glucose-lowering medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors and insulin. Glycemic treatment targets aim for an HbA 1c that ranges from 6.0% to 7.0%, depending on the age of the patients and their risk for hypoglycemia. All patients with type 2 diabetes who smoke must receive smoking cessation intervention(s). Cardiovascular risk factors must be treated to targets, including lipids and blood pressure. Consideration should be given to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) therapy where appropriate. Bariatric surgery should be considered in the obese with type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control. Open dialogue between healthcare professionals and patients is important in order to identify factors that may be undermining self-care, and to rectify poor glucose control early."
9781910797495,chp8,"Persistent postsurgical pain . It is now clear from numerous studies that persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) is one of the major causes of persistent (chronic) pain . Limited data also indicate that a significant percentage of patients continue to have pain following trauma, particularly trauma to multiple body areas or traumatic amputation . Although there is evidence that nerve damage plays a key role, there are other factors that probably determine which patients with nerve damage progress from acute to persistent pain as, in many operations (exempli gratia amputation), all patients have nerve damage but only a percentage (10-50%) progress to chronic pain (Table 8.1) . The only reliable data currently available derive from postsurgery patients and thus this discussion will be limited to these patients . It is possible, but not studied, that similar factors may occur in post-trauma patients (many of whom also undergo surgery) . Although evidence of genetic factors is not available for PPSP, Tegeder et al . (2006) have identified a genetic influence on the development of chronic pain following an acute episode of sciatica . More attention is now being focused on the influence of other patient factors, such as catastrophizing and depression, which influence perioperative and postoperative pain and analgesic use . Preoperative pain intensity has been correlated with postoperative pain intensity in a prospective study of 346 patients undergoing abdominal surgery . The intensity of postoperative pain has been linked to the prevalence of chronic pain . Thus, improved acute pain control pre- and postoperatively may help to prevent PPSP . This serves to illustrate how difficult it is to avoid trauma to nerves at various surgical sites, and that factors other than nerve injury are involved in PPSP . Recognition that the patient has chronic pain, and that the pathophysiology is in the central nervous system, not in the peripheral tissues, is now needed . Patient education . As the majority of PPSP is caused by nerve damage, the treatment options are similar to those for other neuropathic pain syndromes . For example, patients are rarely told that PPSP is a possible complication of surgery . Preoperative patient education about the possibility of PPSP, during the informed consent procedure, may reduce the negative postoperative psychosocial consequences that can complicate treatment . In the authors' experience of patients with PPSP, and supported by several studies, psychosocial factors such as catastrophizing and the pain itself often activate stress and mood disorders, thus worsening pain and interfering with adaptive coping . Postincisional pain . Postincisional syndrome is defined as pain at or close to the site of a surgical incision that persists beyond the usual healing period . Postamputation persistent pain . Postamputation persistent pain is a special case of PPSP because large nerves are deliberately cut in all patients . This emphasizes the multifactorial basis of PPSP . A surprising omission in studies of amputation pain is information about how the nerves amputated are managed (id est clean cut or ligature tied) . The clinical context of amputation may play a role . For example, when the amputation occurs because of a progressive disease, such as diabetes, disease-related preoperative nerve damage and pain are involved . Conversely, traumatic amputation or amputation to prevent spread of disease, such as in breast cancer, may not involve prior nerve damage or pain . As with central pain, after amputation there is synaptic reorganization in the spinal cord, brainstem, thalamus and primary somatosensory cortex, which becomes newly responsive to neighboring body parts . These changes contribute to the persistent pain experienced after amputation . A phantom experience is a non-painful sensation; phantom pain is pain in an absent body part; and stump pain is local pain in the residual limb (id est at the amputation site) . Depending on the tissue amputated, phantom pain may have an early prevalence in excess of 50% . Phantom pain affects not only limbs; phantom bladder, rectal, penile, breast and vaginal pain after surgery are all well described . While phantom sensations may be described as tingling or itchy, phantom pain consists primarily of burning, cramping and shooting pains . Sometimes phantom pain in the missing body part is similar to the pain present before the amputation . Small randomized studies have suggested that morphine decreases pain intensity, albeit during short-term observation periods . ","Persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) is defined as pain at or close to the site of surgical incision that persists beyond the expected healing period. The incidence of PPSP varies from about 10% for very limited peripheral surgery, such as inguinal hernia repair or joint replacement, to 10-30% for mastectomy and up to 50% for thoracotomy and amputation. Nerve injury plays an important role in pathogenesis, but genetics, pre-existing pain and severity of postoperative pain are also risk factors, in addition to cancer treatment and possible psychosocial factors. Patients who catastrophize, which increases postoperative pain and opioid analgesic use, may benefit from psychological services such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Effective acute pain control may be preventive for PPSP - for example, intra- and postoperative use of epidural analgesia can prevent PPSP following some operations. Pharmacotherapy is based on the study results of neuropathic drugs used to treat pain caused by other types of nerve injury. Tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants are first-line drugs. Peripheral nerve stimulation is emerging as a possible treatment option for severe PPSP. Although spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has not been found to be successful for amputation pain, early data indicate positive outcomes for dorsal root (DRG) stimulation."
9781910797211,ch05,"The operation was abandoned but the patient improved substantially . More recently, deep brain stimulation using depth electrodes has been introduced . Which patients require surgery? . Surgery is usually employed in patients when manipulations of drug therapy have failed to control 'off' symptoms, tremor, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias . However, in carefully selected patients surgery leads to control of 'off' symptoms, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias . Patients, their relatives and carers need to understand the limit of any benefits from an operation, and that surgery is not a cure . For these patients, the operation of choice is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamus to enable a reduction in dopaminergic therapy and control of dyskinesias . Patients with severe resistant unilateral tremor may undergo single-side thalamic stimulation . It is not yet possible to say with certainty which patients benefit most from surgery and which operations should be performed . Lesional surgery . Lesional surgery may be preferred to deep brain stimulation when a simpler procedure without complex follow-up is required, especially when it is suspected that a patient will not attend the necessary follow-up after insertion of a stimulator, or if patients have to travel long distances . Lesional surgery is performed by stereotaxy (Figure 5.1) . The patient is therefore woken at the time of lesional placement for physiological stimulation and microelectrode recording . Thalamotomy, surgery on the VIM nucleus of the thalamus, is the most effective way of controlling tremor . Deep brain stimulation is the best method of delivery, particularly if a bilateral operation is required . Lesional surgery of the STN can improve tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity . Deep brain stimulation . The technology was already available from pain pathway stimulation . Non-rechargeable batteries can last up to 5 years and may be conserved by turning stimulation off at night; the patient can do this using a magnet . Patients undergoing deep brain stimulation need to be followed up by a team able to monitor and adjust its effects . Tremor will cease within seconds of starting stimulation and reappears quickly on stopping . VIM deep brain stimulation appears not to be affected by age . The frequency of distal appendicular tremor and greater tremor indicates good control of tremor by VIM deep brain stimulation . Deep brain stimulation can reverse akinesia, rigidity and tremor but not many axial symptoms . Most studies have excluded patients over the age of 75 years . The researchers concluded that non-motor symptoms should be considered when choosing the target for deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease; up to now, deep brain stimulation has primarily focused on motor symptoms . Non-motor symptoms are common, present in early and advanced stages of the disease and have a huge effect on patients' health-related quality of life . They therefore need to be addressed by every treatment offered to patients with Parkinson's disease . Effect on non-motor symptoms . The patients who received neurostimulation had longer periods with less dyskinesia and better-quality mobility . The authors concluded that STN stimulation was superior to conventional medical treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease with early motor complications . However, there is still controversy regarding the study group's patient selection and whether patients in the medical arm were given the best medical therapy available such as apomorphine or intrajejunal levodopa infusion . Nerve-cell transplantation . Over 500 patients worldwide have now received nerve-cell transplants into the brain . However, in the first controlled trial by Freed et al . Furthermore, about 15% of the transplant patients developed severe facial dystonia and disabling 'runaway' dyskinesias . in 2003, 34 patients were randomized to either fetal neural transplant with two volumes of donor tissue or sham surgery . Primary outcome measures again failed to show any significant differences between the two groups, and 56% of transplant patients developed dyskinesias . TRANSEURO study . However, a subsequent phase 2 double-blind placebo-controlled study in 34 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease failed to show any clinical benefit . Retinal cell transplantation . A randomized trial involving 72 patients showed no statistically significant difference in the 'off' state between RPE- and sham-implanted patients at 12 months . ","Surgery is recommended when optimal drug treatment options have failed to control symptoms. Neurosurgery is an unpleasant experience for the patient; the main complications are stroke and infection. For patients with young-onset Parkinson's disease who have had 'on/off' symptoms for many years, the procedure of choice is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus to reduce dopaminergic therapy and control dyskinesias. Lesional surgery is an alternative to deep brain stimulation for patients unlikely to attend regular follow-up or who have to travel long distances, or in instances where the cost of a stimulator is prohibitive. Pallidotomy is appropriate for severe dyskinesia. Thalamic deep brain surgery (VIM nucleus) is the most effective procedure for controlling parkinsonian tremor. In the future, nerve-cell transplantation could replace dopaminergic treatment if sources of dopamine cells other than 6-10-week-old fetuses can be found; trials using porcine fetal cells, stem cells that generate dopamine and other such cells (exempli gratia retinal cells) are under way."
9781908541406,ch_3,"The activities of these components are finely balanced between keeping the blood fluid and preventing excessive activation of the procoagulants, which would lead to intravascular thrombosis . Secondary hemostasis involves activation of the coagulation system, leading to the generation of fibrin strands, which are laid down between platelets and reinforce the platelet plug . Fibrinolysis entails activation of fibrin-bound plasminogen, resulting in clot lysis . Lysis is modulated by inhibitors of fibrinolysis, which are activated by thrombin or released by platelets . In reality, these processes tend to merge, with the activated platelet and endothelial cell membranes providing the foundation on which the clotting factors can become activated, and fibrin formed and lysed . Endothelial cells . Platelets leave the axial column of blood and move to the periphery, where they are activated by P-selectin exposed on the injured endothelium . The VWF tethers platelets to the endothelium, and glycoprotein VI binds platelets to subendothelial collagen . Platelet activation exposes the fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein alphaIIbbeta3, and there are also receptors for thrombin and thromboxane . Binding of these ligands to their receptors induces platelet activation and aggregation . Coagulation system . The coagulation factors are a series of plasma proteins synthesized by the liver that, when activated, generate thrombin and convert fibrinogen to fibrin via a sequence of complex reactions . Initiation phase . At the site of injury, TF forms a complex with factor (F)VII (TF-FVIIa) on the surface of activated platelets . The TF-FVIIa complex activates FIX and FX, and the activated FX cleaves prothrombin to form small amounts of thrombin . Thrombin is a potent activator of platelets, which provide an enhanced catalytic surface on which further coagulation is promoted . The activated platelets release hemostatic factors (exempli gratia fibrinogen and VWF) and polyphosphate, which accelerate the activation of FXI by thrombin . Polyphosphate is also capable of activating FV, further enhancing thrombin formation . Propagation phase . Termination phase . This occurs when protein C is activated and, together with protein S, inhibits activated FV and FVIII, as described below . Inhibitors of coagulation . The plasma contains a series of proteins that inhibit activated procoagulant enzymes and prevent excessive intravascular coagulation . Tissue factor pathway inhibitor binds FXa, forming a complex that rapidly inhibits the TF-FVIIa complex . It limits the overall activation of the coagulation mechanism, preventing excessive fibrin deposition and thrombosis . This pathway is initiated by thrombin when it binds to thrombomodulin on the endothelial surface and activates protein C bound to its receptor on the cell membrane . Activated protein C - along with its cofactor, free protein S - inactivates the activated coagulation factors Va and VIIIa by proteolysis . Protein Z binds to the Z-protease inhibitor and the complex inactivates FXa . Inhibitors of fibrinolysis . Fibrinolysis is inhibited by the following factors . Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and antiplasmin inhibit tPA and plasmin, respectively . Thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor is a carboxypeptidase that is activated by thrombin and cleaves lysine from fibrin, preventing plasminogen binding to fibrin . Defective thrombin generation, as in the various forms of hemophilia, impairs activation of this inhibitor, resulting in enhanced fibrinolysis and bleeding . Sequential steps activate specific procoagulants (identified by Roman numerals; a=activated), eventually culminating in thrombin generation and fibrin formation . TF-FVIIa complex is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor . FVa and FVIIIa are inhibited by activated protein C and protein S . Thrombin is inhibited by thrombomodulin and antithrombin . ","The immediate arrest of hemorrhage depends on vasoconstriction together with the adhesion and aggregation of platelets at the site of vessel injury. The coagulation system is activated by tissue factor expression. This binds and converts factor (F)VII to FVIIa, which initiates a catalytic series of reactions leading to the rapid generation of small amounts of thrombin. Trace concentrations of thrombin trigger the explosive generation of a much larger quantity of thrombin by activating FXI, FVIII and FV in a positive feedback loop. Thrombin further promotes the stability of the platelet-fibrin hemostatic plug by activating platelets, FXIII (cross-linking fibrin strands) and thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor."
9781908541277,ch_11,"All doctors treating women with epilepsy should consider the following areas . The risk of breakthrough pregnancy is not insignificant . Up to 20% of women with epilepsy have abnormal ovarian function, including anovulatory menstrual cycles and polycystic ovaries . These problems may be more common in patients treated with sodium valproate (VPA) . Some women find that their seizures worsen mid-cycle or around menstruation, a phenomenon known as catamenial epilepsy . The fertility of women with treated epilepsy is one-quarter to one-third lower than that of the general population . However, when women do conceive, most can expect to undergo uneventful pregnancies and deliver healthy babies . Women whose epilepsy is well controlled usually remain seizure free during pregnancy and delivery . Conversely, those who continue to report seizures before conception may have increased seizures during pregnancy . Before conception . Although it would be ideal to withdraw AED treatment in women contemplating pregnancy, for many this would result in recurrence or exacerbation of seizures that could be dangerous for both mother and fetus . If AED therapy cannot be withdrawn completely, it should be tapered to a minimally effective dose of, if possible, a single drug . These and other guidelines for managing epilepsy in women who are contemplating pregnancy are set out in Table 8.2 . The incidence of minor and major fetal malformations increases in women with epilepsy, even if they are untreated . Commonly quoted figures are 3-6% for women with epilepsy compared with 2-3% in the general population . The risk increases disproportionately with the number of AEDs taken, being approximately 3% for one drug (similar to background risk), 5% for two, 10% for three and over 20% in women taking more than three AEDs (Figure 8.2) . There are still insufficient data regarding the safety of other modern AEDs . After birth . The risk of intracerebral hemorrhage increases if the birth is traumatic . The Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry was established in the USA in 1996 to determine prospectively the risk of major malformations from AEDs . Women with epilepsy who become pregnant should call the toll-free number (1 888 233 2334) to enroll . All physicians who care for women taking AEDs during pregnancy are invited to contribute . There is also an active prospective pregnancy register in the UK . Elderly patients . Old age is now the most common time in life to develop epilepsy . Approximately 1.5% of the population over the age of 70 years is diagnosed with active epilepsy . The number of elderly people diagnosed with epilepsy is set to rise further with the aging of the population . Underlying factors can be identified in a greater proportion of elderly patients than younger patients, and include cerebrovascular disease, dementia and tumor . Diagnosis of epilepsy can be challenging and may depend on a witnessed event . AEDs are the mainstay of treatment, and are effective in most patients . Complete seizure control can be expected in more than 70% of elderly patients . The patient, and often the spouse and children, must be convinced of the need for lifelong treatment . Sympathetic explanation and assured support will help an elderly person regain their self-confidence after epilepsy has been diagnosed and AED treatment established . In patients with multiple concomitant medications, AEDs that do not produce pharmacokinetic interactions are the preferred choice (see Table 4.6) . Few clinical trials of AEDs have been performed specifically in the elderly . Children who develop epilepsy should be re-evaluated during their teenage years, and AED levels should be monitored . AED doses may, therefore, need to be reduced as a child grows older . Falling AED levels may indicate imperfect compliance, a common occurrence in this age group . The teenage years are an appropriate time for counseling on contraception, clarifying the possible side effects of AEDs, and predicting prognosis and eventual drug withdrawal . Patients with learning disabilities . Tonic-clonic seizures are common, but many patients also have partial and other generalized seizure types . The home assessment should include . previous and current AED treatment . circulating AED levels if appropriate . Home video recordings can help to confirm or refute the diagnosis of epilepsy . Numbers and doses of AEDs should be minimized as much as possible . ","Oral contraceptives containing at least 50 µg of estrogen should be used when coadministered with carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and rufinamide, and topiramate at doses over 200 mg daily, because these drugs induce the metabolism of female sex hormones. Intermittent clobazam just before and shortly after the onset of menstruation can be used in women who experience catamenial seizures. The risk of major malformations in babies exposed in utero seems to be greater with sodium valproate (VPA) than with other AEDs. AED treatment is continued when necessary during pregnancy because seizures, especially convulsive seizures, are more harmful to the mother and fetus than the drugs themselves; however, treatment should be tapered to a minimally effective dose before pregnancy, if possible to a single AED. Supplemental folic acid, 4-5 mg daily, should be administered before conception and continued at least until the end of week 12 of gestation. A witness's account is particularly important for the correct diagnosis of epilepsy in the elderly, in whom the presentation of seizures is often subtle. Low doses of AEDs are recommended in the elderly in order to minimize adverse effects, particularly neurotoxicity. Preferred choices include lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV). The teenage years are an appropriate time for counseling on contraception and other lifestyle issues including driving, social interactions and careers. Broad-spectrum AEDs (exempli gratia VPA, LTG, TPM, LEV, zonisamide) should be the treatment of choice in people with learning difficulties; barbiturates and benzodiazepines should be avoided."
9781908541086,ch_10,"In seven studies published since 2004, most patients with anorexia ascertained through outpatient settings had achieved remission by 5-year follow-up, but inpatient samples had lower remission rates . In these most recent studies, rates of continued anorexia at follow-up ranged from 2% in a 9-year follow-up of patients at a community clinic, to 18% at 12 years for individuals from an inpatient center; other participants who did not achieve remission over the course of follow-up had moved to a diagnosis of either bulimia or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) . One consistent finding across long-term studies has been that a large proportion of anorexic patients followed over time suffered from additional psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, affective disorders, substance-use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline or histrionic personality disorders; schizophrenia is only rarely observed at follow-up . More than one-third of patients have recurrent affective illnesses . In a study comparing the outcomes of patients with anorexia and bulimia, researchers found that the number of patients making a full recovery was twice as high in the group with bulimia than in the group with anorexia; approximately one-third of each group relapsed after full recovery . Variables affecting outcome . In long-term outcome studies of anorexia nervosa, the findings regarding prognostic factors have also been very heterogeneous . Most studies indicated that a short duration of symptoms before treatment resulted in a favorable outcome, but findings are ambiguous regarding age at onset of illness . In contrast, a good parent-child relationship may protect the patient from a poor outcome . In addition, the data clearly show that chronicity leads to negative outcome, a finding that implies that there are cases of anorexia refractory to treatment . A cross-cultural study revealed that the outcome of an adolescent eating disorder is relatively similar across cultures, and that a later onset leads to a better prognosis . No definite conclusion can be drawn from the outcome studies as to the relevance of socioeconomic status . Anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychological disorder . In a prospective 21-year follow-up study, 16% of 84 patients with anorexia had died from the disorder and its complications . Across studies published since 2004, the crude mortality rates have ranged from 0 to 8%, with a cumulative rate of 2.8% . These rates are lower than those previously reported, which may reflect improvement in medical stabilization of the patients and/or study recruitment from sources with less severely ill cases . If identified at this early stage, patients typically seek treatment and appear to be motivated to overcome the problem . Without treatment most patients experience a chronic fluctuation of binge/purge behavior . Although individuals with bulimia experience variations in their weight, they rarely approach the low weight ranges associated with anorexia . Recent data are available on the longitudinal course of bulimia from a total of 79 study series covering over 5000 patients followed between 6 months and 12 years . On average, close to 45% of the patients showed full recovery from bulimia, whereas 27% improved considerably, and nearly 23% had a chronic protracted course . Crossover to another eating disorder (most often EDNOS, more rarely anorexia) at the follow-up evaluation amounted to a mean of 22.5% . The data suggest a curvilinear course, with highest recovery rates between 4 and 9 years of follow-up, and reverse peaks for both improvement and chronicity before 4 years and after 10 years of follow-up . Although many studies have investigated potential prognostic factors, there was only conflicting evidence . As stated above, the course and outcome for women with bulimia is generally more favorable than for those with anorexia . A study in the UK found that bulimia and binge-eating disorder among young women had different courses and outcomes . While the prognosis of those with bulimia was relatively poor, the majority of those with binge-eating disorder recovered during a 5-year follow-up period . Across outcome studies of bulimia, crude mortality rates have ranged from 0 to 2%, with a cumulative mortality rate of 0.4% . Adjusting for duration of follow-up, death appeared to be five times less likely to occur in bulimia than in anorexia across the studies reviewed . Course and prognosis . ","Despite increasing research on short- and long-term outcomes of anorexia, the disease still has a relatively poor prognosis; the mortality rate is the highest of all psychiatric disorders, although it has decreased in recent years. Although results from long-term studies support optimism for most patients with eating disorders, approximately 30% of patients with bulimia and atypical eating disorders remain ill at 10-20 years following presentation. Anorexia can have serious effects on reproductive functioning and the health of neonates. Bulimia usually persists for several years, and associated medical complications can result in intermittent hospitalization."
9781910797457,chp5,"Several treatment options are available for men with clinically localized prostate cancer (Table 5.1) . Treatment decisions depend on many factors but the risk category is at the core . The likelihood of a man with localized prostate cancer dying from the disease itself, as opposed to other causes, increases with the risk category but decreases with age and comorbidities . As men with localized disease often do not experience significant disease-related morbidity for many years after diagnosis, and curative treatment itself may result in some morbidity, those with lower-risk cancers and a shorter life expectancy are least likely to benefit from radical treatment . Active surveillance . Active surveillance is increasingly popular, particularly for men with small-volume and low-to-moderate-grade prostate cancer (very-low- or low-risk category), who have a low risk of death from prostate cancer (Table 5.3) . These men are eligible for curative therapy but this option is often deferred until objective signs of disease progression are observed . Recent studies have shown that men with low-risk prostate cancer have a low risk of developing metastases, although the risk is reasonably high for men with intermediate-risk cancers . Therefore, younger men with intermediate risk cancers should usually be encouraged to choose treatment rather than active surveillance . Cancer-specific survival in men who fit the criteria for active surveillance is 99% at 8 years' follow-up . Radical prostatectomy . Long-term studies have shown normal life expectancy in patients with complete excision of specimen-confined disease . The difference was greatest in men under 65 years of age . A similar US study, the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), which had a high proportion of patients with low-risk prostate cancer, reported no difference in overall survival (OS) at a median follow-up of 10 years, but radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk cancers provided a 60% reduction in prostate cancer mortality . The most recent study, ProtecT, randomized men with predominantly low- and intermediate-risk cancers to active surveillance, radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy . This study has been criticized on the basis of the allocation of intermediate-risk patients to active surveillance, and because a difference in mortality between surgery and radiotherapy would not be expected as early as 10 years in men with predominantly low/intermediate-risk disease . Surgery can also be effective for high-risk prostate cancer, particularly if the disease appears to be localized to the prostate gland . In cases of T3 prostate cancer, surgery may be appropriate if it is considered that the cancer can be fully excised . Extended lymph node dissection should also be considered in men undergoing radical prostatectomy for high-risk cancer . In the longer term, there is a risk of urinary frequency and bleeding, which may be severe in 2-3% of patients . In the longer term there is an increased risk of rectal and bladder cancers . A number of studies have shown that cancer control is better in men with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer if the radiation dose is escalated beyond 78 Gy . External-beam radiation alone (id est without prior hormonal reduction therapy) is no longer recommended, particularly for patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease . Evidence is building to support its use in men with early localized prostate cancer, and early data suggest a role in men with intermediate-risk cancer . Patients tend to appreciate the short duration of treatment (usually only a week) . Patient selection criteria are given in Table 5.7 . The results in patients with intermediate risk are worse, however, with approximately 66% of men free from recurrence at 10 years . Watchful waiting . In another study, patients with low-grade tumors who underwent watchful waiting had a 92% disease-specific survival at 10 years, compared with 76% for moderate-grade tumors and 43% for high-grade tumors . Men with high-risk prostate cancer have a considerably increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality . High-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) has been developed for the treatment of localized prostate cancer . Early results are promising, with some series reporting that about three-quarters of men with low-risk disease are disease free at 5 years' follow-up . HIFU can also be used for the treatment of cancer recurrence after radiotherapy . The reliability and durability of this treatment is still uncertain . If progression occurs, treatment with an LHRH analog may prove beneficial . ","The treatment of localized prostate cancer is controversial. Active surveillance is increasingly used for very-low- and low-risk disease. Only about one-third of men managed with active surveillance will go on to require curative treatment. Radical prostatectomy probably offers the best prospect of long-term cure but carries the disadvantages of possible sexual dysfunction and incontinence. In the case of high-risk cancer, surgery may be considered as part of a multimodal therapeutic approach. External-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) can be curative but may be associated with rectal or bladder complications. Brachytherapy can be combined with EBRT in higher-risk individuals. Treatment with EBRT and hormonal therapy is more effective than radiotherapy alone in men with intermediate- and high-risk cancer. In a large international trial, the antiandrogen bicalutamide, 150 mg/day, reduced objective progression by 31% but gynecomastia was common."
9781910797662,ch06,"Radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy . Radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is indicated for the treatment of . disease that is unresponsive to treatment with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) . The surgery is associated with a very low rate of local pelvic recurrence in patients without lymph node metastasis . Removal of these lymph nodes is crucial for accurate staging and provides potentially curative treatment in patients with N1 or N2 disease . Almost two-thirds of patients will experience at least one complication following radical cystectomy, and up to one-quarter will require re-admission after discharge . Morbidity may significantly limit use of adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery . ERAS protocols have demonstrated benefits in the post-operative management of patients undergoing radical cystectomy, with quicker return of bowel function and shorter length of hospital stay . Long-term tumor control outcomes following radical cystectomy vary considerably; 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of 58-62% are reported in contemporary series . Minimally invasive surgery . Peri-operative treatment for intermediate- or high-risk bladder cancer . Additional treatment approaches should be considered for the management of organ-confined cancer that is at high risk of local or distant recurrence . Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy are collectively referred to as perioperative systemic therapies . Adjuvant therapy refers to additional treatment given after definitive primary treatment, with the intention of destroying microscopic residual cancer cells in order to reduce the risk of local or distant relapse . Most patients who receive adjuvant therapy will not benefit from it: either the cancer has already been cured by primary therapy or micrometastatic disease exists that is already resistant to the planned adjuvant therapy . However, adjuvant therapy is curative in a subgroup of patients . Until these patients can be identified reliably, all eligible patients are treated and may experience the resultant side effects of treatment, even though only a minority will benefit . Neoadjuvant therapy refers to the use of systemic therapy before definitive primary treatment, in an attempt to downstage the primary tumor, eliminate micrometastatic disease or enhance the efficacy of the primary treatment . A large number of clinical trials have explored the benefits of perioperative therapies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer . All patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stage T2 or above) without distant metastases should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting . Patients considered suitable for systemic chemotherapy should be offered cisplatin-based neoadjuvant therapy . Adjuvant therapy should still be considered for patients requiring urgent surgical management . Patients who are unfit for cisplatin may expect smaller benefits, which may influence decisions about whether perioperative therapy is appropriate . There is no evidence that further postoperative chemotherapy adds benefit for patients who still have viable tumor at cystectomy after preoperative chemotherapy . All suitable patients should be considered for clinical trials, if available and appropriate . Multimodality and bladder-preserving therapy . Whilst radical cystectomy is the curative modality used for most patients with cancer that is clinically confined to the bladder, not all patients are medically suitable for this procedure, or choose not to undergo it . Medically unfit patients may derive better palliative benefit from more conservative therapy such as radiation therapy or best supportive care . Bladder-conserving definitive treatment can be considered for appropriate patients - generally those with smaller-volume cancers . This approach integrates systemic chemotherapy with radiation therapy, the former primarily acting as a radiosensitizer . Finally, some patients may benefit from multimodality approaches combining two or more of surgery, radiation therapy and systemic treatment . A large retrospective study of 348 patients with stage T2-T4a disease assessed outcomes after treatment with cisplatin and radiation therapy in the context of maximal transurethral resection of tumor, and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients were monitored with repeat biopsy, and subsequent treatment was guided by the initial tumor response . Patients experiencing complete remission received additional chemotherapy and a boost of radiation . Complete remission was observed in 72% of patients . Cystectomy was required in 144 patients with suboptimal response or recurrent disease; no patient required cystectomy for treatment-related toxicity . Current recommendations include combination chemoradiotherapy as a reasonable alternative to cystectomy for selected patients . ","Bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment is not indicated for bladder cancer that is T2 or higher. Surgical resection (radical or partial cystectomy) is the mainstay of treatment for patients suitable for surgery. Adequate node dissection should be performed at the time of cystectomy. For patients being managed with curative intent, chemoradiotherapy should be considered as an alternative to surgery, with appropriate multidisciplinary input. Cytotoxic drugs are used in the context of chemoradiotherapy with the intention of improving local disease control rather than achieving distant control. Toxicity is greater with combined chemotherapy and radiation than with radiation therapy alone. Patients treated with palliative intent are probably best offered radiation therapy only if surgery is not appropriate."
9781910797150,ch05,"Breakthrough CINV . Even with improved control of acute and delayed CINV and adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, breakthrough CINV within 5 days of chemotherapy administration (see page 17) remains a significant clinical problem . Breakthrough CINV usually requires immediate treatment or 'rescue' with additional antiemetics . Clinicians should provide patients with a prescription for rescue antiemetic treatment before the patient leaves the clinic or hospital, so that in the event of breakthrough CINV occurring, treatment can be started immediately . As patients may or may not derive some benefit from the original antiemetic regimen, this may or may not be continued . Agents that are found to effectively treat a patient's breakthrough CINV should be given routinely for at least 3 days rather than on an as-needed basis . Treatment options . The agents used prophylactically to prevent CINV have not demonstrated significant efficacy in the treatment of established CINV . Olanzapine and metoclopramide have been the only agents studied for the treatment of breakthrough CINV in phase III clinical trials . During 72 hours of observation, significantly more patients receiving olanzapine had no recurrent emesis (70% vs 31%) and no nausea (68% vs 23%) . On this basis, the NCCN guidelines state that patients who develop nausea or vomiting after chemotherapy (days 1 to 5) despite adequate prophylaxis should be considered for treatment with a 3-day regimen of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day . Refractory CINV . A change in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen should be considered for those patients who develop CINV during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy when antiemetic prophylaxis has not been successful in controlling CINV in earlier cycles . Treatment options . Few studies have examined CINV in this setting . If anxiety is considered to be a major patient factor in CINV, a benzodiazepine such as lorazepam or alprazolam can be added to the prophylactic regimen . If the patient is receiving HEC, olanzapine (days 1 to 4) can be substituted for the NK-1 RA in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen . Mild to moderate sedation in elderly patients may be a potential problem associated with olanzapine . NCCN guidelines recommend the use of olanzapine, palonosetron and dexamethasone as an alternative first-line prophylactic antiemetic regimen for patients receiving HEC . This regimen may be useful in patients who experience refractory CINV and need a revision in their prophylactic antiemetic regimen . Anticipatory CINV . If CINV is effectively controlled during the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient is likely to have effective control during subsequent cycles of the same chemotherapy . If the patient has a poor experience with CINV in the first cycle, it may be more difficult to control CINV in subsequent cycles, and refractory and/or anticipatory CINV may develop . The earlier anticipatory CINV is identified, the more likely treatment will be effective . To prevent the occurrence of anticipatory CINV (see pages 17-18), patients should be counseled about their 'expectations' of CINV before the initial course of treatment . Patients should be informed that very effective prophylactic antiemetic regimens will be used and that 70-75% of patients have a complete response (id est no emesis and no use of rescue medications) . For optimum control of CINV during the first course of chemotherapy, each patient should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen based on the specific type of chemotherapy (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2, pages 54-7) and their individual risk factors (see Table 2.2, page 18) before the first course of chemotherapy . Treatment options . If anticipatory CINV occurs despite the use of guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics, additional antiemetic drugs do not seem to be effective . Behavioral therapy should be considered instead . Early screening and referral to a psychologist or other mental health professional with specific experience of working with patients with cancer is essential when anticipatory CINV is identified . ","Breakthrough CINV within 5 days of chemotherapy administration remains a significant clinical problem despite the development of effective agents for the prevention of CINV. Olanzapine has been shown in a phase III clinical trial to be an effective treatment. A change in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen should be considered for those patients who develop refractory CINV. If the patient has a poor experience with CINV in the first cycle, anticipatory CINV may develop requiring behavioral therapy. Optimum control of CINV during the first course of chemotherapy may prevent breakthrough, refractory and anticipatory CINV. Each patient should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen based on the specific type of chemotherapy and their individual risk factors before the first course of chemotherapy."
9781912776696,hh-10,"The x -axis represents time (t) from randomization and the estimated probability of being event free at time t is plotted on the y -axis . The medians for both OS and PFS, for each of the treatment groups, are clearly identifiable by drawing horizontal lines at probability = 0.5 on the y -axis . probability of the event = 1 - probability of being . occurring by time t event free at time t . Cumulative incidence curves . Consider the events 'death without progression' and 'progression' . probability of dying without progression by time t . probability of progression by time t . To display results in subgroups within a trial, enabling an assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect . To present results across trials in a meta-analysis . Given the small sample size, care must be taken in concluding a differential treatment effect in that subgroup . As mentioned in Chapter 3, the power for a time-to-event endpoint is driven by the number of patients with events and not directly by the number of patients . It would be of value, therefore, within the forest plot (exempli gratia in the column headed 'Number of patients' in Figure 7.3), to give not only the number of patients in each subgroup but also the number of patients with events . Another useful feature for the forest plot would be the calculation and inclusion of p -values for treatment x covariate interactions . The potential for a differential treatment effect across the subgroups of patients with measurable and non-measurable disease is raised on page 90 . An example of a forest plot for presentation of trial data in a meta-analysis is shown in Figure 7.4 . Data for a meta-analysis come from the summary statistics in publications identified as being relevant for a treatment comparison of interest . If the focus is only on published studies, this could result in a biased view of the experimental treatment effect . Waterfall plots can be used to display the change in tumor burden for each individual patient following treatment . Positive values correspond to patients whose tumor burden has increased, while negative values are recorded for patients whose tumor burden has reduced . Displaying waterfall plots for each treatment group, one on top of the other, or color coded on the same plot, can be a useful aid when comparing treatments . Swimmer plots also focus on individual patient data and display key events during treatment and follow-up, such as start of response, end of response, end of treatment, progression and death (Figure 7.7) . Box and whisker plots . Box and whisker plots are good ways to represent aspects of the distribution of an outcome . Finally, all data values outside of the lower and upper whiskers are marked on the plot and considered as outliers . Box and whisker plots are a useful way of displaying data over time or across visits . They can be used to compare an outcome across different tumor types or to highlight differences between treatments: for example, for a particular laboratory parameter (Figure 7.9) . For a laboratory parameter or vital sign measured over time, these medians can be joined across time within each treatment group to help pick up trends . Trends are much easier to identify in a plot than in a table, especially when comparing treatment groups . The purpose here is to present key adverse event data in a single plot, which highlights where treatment differences lie (Figure 7.10) . The events displayed in Figure 7.10 are the most frequent adverse events in two treatment groups and are potentially those of greatest concern . With a zero observed risk in the control group, the RR is not defined . A shift plot displaying such data in a graphical way can make it easier to interpret the data, especially when data from both treatment groups are displayed in the same plot . In Figure 7.11, each patient can be represented by a single point, with the treatment groups identified using different colors/symbols in the plot . The shift plot in Figure 7.11 has the laboratory value at the end of treatment on the y -axis . Alternatively, it may be the maximum value on treatment that is the most critical value and the y -axis can be defined in this way . Network geometry plots (network meta-analysis) . A meta-analysis combines the results from a series of trials comparing two treatments, A and B . A network geometry plot provides a summary of the studies that make up the network . ","Kaplan-Meier curves are used to display data on a time-to-event endpoint. Cumulative incidence functions are used with a composite endpoint when there is interest in separating out the different components of the composite. Forest plots display results for subgroups in a clinical trial, or across a series of trials in a meta-analysis. The change in tumor burden from baseline over a treatment period or through to the end of follow-up at the individual patient level can be displayed in a waterfall plot. Swimmer plots also identify key events during treatment at the individual patient level. Box and whisker plots look at the distribution of data and can be used for laboratory parameters, vital signs and QTc intervals over time or across different tumor types. Relative risks for adverse events can be displayed for the most frequent adverse events to highlight where treatment differences lie. Concerning increases in laboratory parameters from baseline can be identified by plotting, relative to the normal range, the baseline value on the x -axis and the maximum value over time on the y -axis in trellis plots."
9781908541062,ch_5,"By definition, RA can start at any age from 16 upwards, although an equivalent disease also occurs in children (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis) . The overall prevalence of RA in adults is 0.5-1% in most Western populations . The incidence of RA varies by as much as tenfold between studies, and lies between 30 and 300 per 100000 population per year . RA occurs in all societies, with no clear geographic or climatic influence . Similarly, a low prevalence has been reported in certain rural Chinese and Japanese communities . In Africa, a lower prevalence was reported in a rural than in an urban community . This could reflect a genuine difference in prevalence but could also be explained by other factors, such as a lower mortality from RA-associated infections in the town-dwellers or differences in the age structure of the two communities . Historically, RA has been considered a chronic disabling disease that does not shorten lifespan . Consequently, life expectancy in severe RA is reduced, on average, by 7 years for men and 4 years for women . RA patients are more than three times more likely to be hospitalized with a myocardial infarction (MI) than patients without RA and almost six times more likely to have a silent MI . RA patients are also twice as likely to develop heart failure, even allowing for traditional risk factors and ischemic heart disease . Subclinical vasculitis could also predispose to atherosclerosis in RA . The overall malignancy risk in RA is similar to that in the general population, although there is a slight increase in immune system neoplasms such as lymphomas (approximately twice as common in RA) and multiple myeloma . Infection-related mortality is increased in RA . As well as predisposing to local infections and contributing to the enhanced lung cancer risk, interstitial lung disease per se is a cause of excess mortality in RA patients, as is peptic ulcer disease, the latter largely secondary to NSAID and corticosteroid use . Some recent studies have suggested that early intervention with antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate and TNF blockade has reduced the overall severity of RA, with a concomitant reduction in mortality . The economic costs of an illness are categorized as direct, indirect and intangible . Direct costs are the costs of medicines, and primary and secondary care . For RA, these include the costs of inpatient care, either for rehabilitation or for complications of the disease and joint surgery . Indirect costs represent the consequences of unemployment and reduced productivity . Intangible costs reflect the psychosocial consequences of RA that impact on psychological wellbeing and quality of life . A recent analysis by the UK National Audit Office estimated the annual direct costs of RA to be in the region of £560 million, and total costs up to £4.8 billion per year . Work disability in RA varies between studies, but functional disability invariably occurs in the absence of early and effective treatment . A UK-based study from the pre-biologic era, of patients with disease of an average duration of 6 months, reported only 33% of patients with normal function at presentation and 10% of patients with severe disability . By 5 years, 40% had normal function, but 16% had severe disability . Of those initially in paid employment, 27% were work-disabled by 5 years . Other studies suggest an even higher rate of work disability, with a third of patients ceasing work within 2 years of diagnosis, although early biological therapy has had a major impact on job retention and employment prospects . The cost-benefit equation . Several of the newer therapies for RA have been expensive to develop and are costly to manufacture; consequently, their price can exceed $15000 (£10000)/patient/year . Furthermore, some require intravenous administration, which entails additional costs . If, in addition, function and employment are retained, total direct, indirect and intangible costs will be significantly reduced . A recent estimate from the UK National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society suggests that the loss of productivity when a patient stops work because of RA equates to almost £300000 . Thus, the cost-benefit equation for novel RA interventions is complicated and cannot be fully ascertained for several years after their introduction into clinical practice . Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and is a heterogeneous disease . Classification criteria for RA have recently been updated jointly by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) . ","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a global disease, present in all populations studied. RA should not be viewed as a benign chronic disease of the elderly. The peak age of onset occurs during working life, severely reducing participation and productivity. Furthermore, mortality is increased and there is very significant comorbidity. The disease inflicts huge economic costs on both the individual and society. It is essential that total healthcare and societal costs are considered when the economic impact of new drugs is considered. It remains to be determined whether the new targeted biological therapies will reduce the mortality associated with RA."
9781910797853,chp5,"Discussion of the goals of treatment with the patient and family should, in most cases, focus on the potential benefits of treatment for short- and long-term outcomes . In the UK, most patients are offered access to a national clinical trial . Induction therapy . Some patients may need two courses of induction to attain a CR . Post-remission therapy . Almost all patients who initially achieve CR ultimately relapse unless post-remission therapy is given . Treatment of elderly or unfit patients .

Approximately 20-40% of adults with ALL are cured using current treatment regimens . Induction therapy . Standard induction therapy involves one of two regimens . Most adult patients are offered allogeneic HSCT at first remission . HCST can also be effective in patients who relapse, and it should be expedited after intensive salvage therapy .

Treatment of children . initial white blood cell count . spread of disease . A number of protocols for intensively managing pediatric patients have been devised . Induction therapy . Treating relapse . Patients with relapsed ALL have an extremely poor prognosis . New and emerging therapies . Staging and how to treat . Treatment decisions for patients with CML are complex because there are many, sometimes conflicting, therapeutic options . the response to treatment with TKIs (for patients in early phases) . Although they may not cure the disease, they can achieve long-term control in most patients; as a result, they have become first-line treatment for almost all newly diagnosed patients with CML . A small proportion of previously untreated patients with chronic phase CML are resistant to or intolerant of treatment with TKIs, and many patients with initial responses to a TKI ultimately lose their response . Responses are short lived, although responding patients survive longer than non-responders . Other agents that may be beneficial in patients who are not transplantation candidates and are intolerant or refractory to treatment with TKIs include . Staging and when to treat . CLL is an extremely heterogeneous disease, with certain subsets of patients having survival rates without treatment that are similar to the normal population . Hence, not all patients with CLL will require treatment at the time of diagnosis . Observation rather than immediate treatment is the standard of care for newly diagnosed patients with early-stage asymptomatic CLL . Localized radiotherapy is usually offered to patients with localized (stage I) CLL . In contrast, patients with more advanced CLL, or those with symptoms or progressive disease, have a median survival without treatment between 18 months and 3 years . The following studies should be performed before initiating treatment in patients with CLL . CT of the chest, abdomen or pelvis is not required before treatment; it is usually reserved for patients enrolled in clinical trials . New and emerging therapies . It is approved for use in patients with CLL who have had more than one course of therapy, and as primary treatment in patients with chromosome 17 p13.1 deletions or TP53 mutations . Pre-treatment evaluation of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) must establish the precise diagnosis, the extent of disease and the performance status of the patient . In most patients, durable remissions can be achieved, with long treatment-free periods followed by further therapy after symptomatic relapse . When to treat . Many patients with HCL are asymptomatic and can be observed for months or years before requiring treatment . Therapy is indicated only when the patient develops one or more of the following . IFNalpha may also be used for patients treated unsuccessfully with purine analogs . ","Induction therapy for most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises intensive anthracycline/cytarabine (Ara-C) combination chemotherapy aimed at achieving a complete response (CR). However, almost all patients who achieve a CR after induction therapy will ultimately relapse without post-remission therapy. Post-remission therapy for AML, comprising one or more courses of chemotherapy, or autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), is given to eliminate any residual disease and achieve a cure. The ideal donor for HSCT is a sibling with complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. Unrelated donors who are a good match or related donors with some matching may also be suitable, but the risk of graft-versus-host disease is increased. Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprises chemotherapeutic induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy with central nervous system prophylaxis. Treatment options for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) include disease control with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or palliative therapy with cytotoxic agents and, less commonly, HSCT. TKIs are the initial treatment of choice for almost all patients with newly diagnosed CML. Treatment decisions for patients with CML depend on the phase of the disease, response to TKI treatment, age and eligibility for HSCT. The standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is observation rather than immediate treatment. Treatment is indicated for patients with more advanced or symptomatic disease to ameliorate symptoms and improve survival."
9781910797297,chp3,"B lymphocytes (B cells) and T lymphocytes (T cells) are the major players in the adaptive immune system . Here, we focus on the immunologic role of the T cell . T-cell pathophysiology . T cells arise from lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow and mature within the thymus . Mature T cells are further subdivided into T-helper (Th) cells and T-suppressor cells . Th cells express CD4, while T-suppressor cells express CD8 . These activated T cells can also inhibit cell-mediated immunity by producing tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta and interleukin (IL)-10 . Over time, the levels of myeloid cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells decrease, leading to a monoclonal population . Given the significant number of clinical and histological mimics of MF, good clinicopathological correlation is essential for accurate diagnosis in this disease . However, the histopathology of MF can vary greatly, especially with the differing clinical presentations of patches, plaques and tumors (see Chapter 2) . These are rare in early-stage MF, but common in plaque-stage disease . However, these may be absent if recent topical treatments have been initiated (Figure 3.7) . Haloed lymphocytes are also helpful in differentiating inflammatory diseases from MF . Furthermore, Langerhans cells and eosinophils are not an uncommon histological finding in MF . Plaque-stage disease . Epidermotropism may be lost, and the lymphocytes can be much more varied in size and shape (Figure 3.11) . Large cell transformation (id est cells that are more than 4 times the size of a normal lymphocyte) has been detected in up to 50% of patients with advanced-stage tumors . By definition, large cell transformation is present if more than 25% of the dermal infiltrate is composed of large pleomorphic, anaplastic or immunoblastic cells (Figure 3.12) . Large cell transformation may be either CD30+ or CD30-, with the latter portending a poorer prognosis (Figure 3.13) . This term has been associated with non-neoplastic conditions, but it is generally felt to be most closely associated with MF . Although most cases of MF are CD7-, many inflammatory diseases that clinically mimic MF are also CD7 . CD8+ predominant cytotoxic cases also exist (Figure 3.20) . These include CD8+ MF with a cytotoxic phenotype as well as the somewhat controversial entity of hypopigmented MF . Early-stage MF can present with CD8+ predominance in up to 20% of cases . However, these markers can also be positive in indolent diseases such as MF, LyP, PC-ALCL and SPTCL . Clinical correlation is necessary to rule out the clinically aggressive cytotoxic lymphomas . Laboratory work-up for MF depends on the stage of the disease, as well as institutional and provider preferences . In early patch-stage disease, a clinical assessment of body surface area and lymph node examination is generally all that is needed for staging (see Chapter 5) . In early patch-stage disease, the histology results and clinical presentation will determine whether a subsequent systemic work-up should be performed . This phenotype is associated with central memory T cells . It can only be distinguished from MF when diagnosed alongside the clinical picture . Interestingly, T-follicular helper phenotypes are also associated with other systemic T-cell processes such as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and some peripheral T-cell lymphomas . By definition, patients with SS are at an advanced stage of disease and a complete systemic work-up must be performed . As with all CTCLs, interpretation of the data must include clinical correlation . T-cell receptor polymerase chain reaction . Up to 80-90% of cases of MF are shown to have clonal populations for beta and/or gamma genes (Figure 3.24), although this may only be 50-60% in early disease . However, T-cell clonality is not specific to MF . Autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory processes can also have clonal T-cell populations . For this reason, the molecular genetics of both diseases are discussed here . ","With all cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), histopathology and clinical correlation is crucial in reaching the diagnosis. Malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) are derived from skin-homing resident effector memory T cells, while in Sézary syndrome (SS), the malignant cells are derived from central memory T cells. Both MF and SS usually display a CD3+, CD4+, CD7-, CD8- immunophenotype; however, CD8+ predominant cases of MF do exist. Histopathology of MF is characterized by small- to medium-sized T lymphocytes with epidermotropic cerebriform/pleomorphic nuclei, Pautrier's microabscesses, haloed lymphocytes along the dermal-epidermal junction and papillary dermal fibrosis. Tumor-stage MF has a more dense, diffuse and nodular infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes and can lack epidermotropism. Large cell transformation can occur in plaque- and tumor-stage disease. These cells are more than 4 times the size of a normal lymphocyte and must account for more than 25% of the atypical infiltrate. They can be either CD30+ or CD30-, with the latter leading to a poorer prognosis. Patients with early patch-stage MF generally do not need full systemic work-up; however, patients with plaque- and tumor-stage MF and SS need complete systemic work-up performed for staging. T-cell receptor polymerase chain reacton (TCR PCR) is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of MF, SS and other CTCLs. It is not 100% specific; however, in the correct clinical and histopathological setting it can be useful in determining monoclonality of the malignant lymphocytes. Matching clones identified from different samples are more useful in the diagnosis."
9781910797433,ch08,"There remain a number of unmet medical needs in the treatment of ovarian cancer, including improving cure rates and overcoming acquired resistance to platinum . Precision medicine has become a key strategy in ovarian cancer as a result of advances in a number of areas, including pharmacogenomics, bioinformatics and molecular biology (Figure 8.1) . Ultimately, it is hoped that targeted therapies will offer improved outcomes . Approaches to targeted therapy . The first attempts at developing targeted therapies in ovarian cancer have revolved around the recognition that epithelial ovarian cancers have different prognoses and distinct molecular changes associated with different histological subtypes . By contrast, mucinous and clear cell tumors confer a significantly worse prognosis, and are more usually associated with KRAS and ARID1A mutations . These findings, particularly in tumors with poor prognostic histologies, offer opportunities to design clinical trials targeting these molecular pathways . Several different strategies have been advocated for targeted approaches to ovarian cancer, generally involving identification of a gene or protein that is overexpressed and can be reasonably targeted with acceptable toxicity (Figure 8.2) . This can result in multiple replication errors leading to chromosomal instability and apoptotic cell death (Figure 8.3) . The inter-relationship between PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutations offers a novel therapeutic strategy, whereby the simultaneous perturbation of two genes results in cell death: this is known as synthetic lethality . As more critical genes and pathways are identified, this strategy is likely to become more widely used to treat cancers . Strategies to increase the number of patients who would benefit from PARP inhibition have led investigators to examine the role of other genes that influence DNA repair in the homologous recombination pathway . In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, a number of other genes such as RAD51 and PALB2 have been shown to play a significant role in the development of ovarian cancer, as described in Chapter 3 . Mutations or epigenetic alterations in these genes result in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) . PARP inhibitors . Four PARP inhibitors have been developed for use in ovarian cancer: olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib . The first part of ARIEL2 included platinum-sensitive patients who had previously received at least one previous platinum line, while the second part included those with three or four lines of treatment, including both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant disease . As a result, niraparib has received regulatory approval in the USA for maintenance treatment of all women with recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status . Veliparib is another highly selective PARP inhibitor that has been developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer . Current studies are investigating combinations of PARP inhibitors with anti-angiogenic therapies and immuno-oncologics (see below) . In addition, most PARP inhibitors are being assessed in earlier lines of therapy, including front-line treatment . Anti-angiogenesis therapies . There are a number of angiogenesis pathways that represent promising therapeutic targets; indeed, to date, inhibition of angiogenesis has been the most successful targeted strategy in ovarian cancer . Initial single-agent activity has been demonstrated in recurrent ovarian cancer in both platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease: Table 8.1 details the various trials by line of therapy . The concept is that if the immune system can learn to recognize malignant cells as foreign antigens, a robust T-cell mediated response, among other pathways, could be induced . Cancer cells evade these tumor-directed T cells by subverting immune checkpoint pathways and other immune-regulatory mechanisms . Table 8.2 shows examples of some of the principal compounds currently under investigation in ovarian cancer . These agents have shown remarkable long-term responses in multiple solid tumors, and are approved in a number of cancers including melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer and urothelial cancers . Given their mechanisms of action, these agents may show survival benefit without inducing a significant objective response . It should be noted that these agents can cause significant and life-threatening adverse effects, including inflammation of the liver, lungs and colon . It has been suggested that a combination of immune agents with PARP inhibitors might be beneficial, because tumor mutations and DNA alterations can generate neo-antigens that have been associated with an improved response to immune checkpoint therapies . Clinical trials are in development to investigate this theory . ","Precision medicine has become a key strategy in ovarian cancer. There is great hope that targeted therapies will offer improved outcomes. Targeted therapy generally involves identifying a gene or protein that is overexpressed in cancer and can be reasonably targeted with acceptable toxicity. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors - olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib - appear to be comparable in efficacy, but have differing toxicity profiles. Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is the most successful targeted therapy strategy in ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab has shown activity as a single agent in recurrent ovarian cancer in both platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease. A number of immuno-oncologic therapies, including inhibitors of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), have shown efficacy in various solid tumors and are under active development in ovarian cancer."
9781910797495,chp4,"Trigeminal neuralgia is an idiopathic paroxysmal recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal (fifth cranial) nerve (Figure 4.1) . Pain is usually caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal ganglion or its branches (Figure 4.2), but bony abnormalities or otherwise inapparent multiple sclerosis (MS) can also be associated with trigeminal neuralgia . Although up to 15% of people with MS have trigeminal neuralgia, it is only rarely (0.2%) diagnosed before MS . Rarely, a space-occupying lesion (exempli gratia tumor) in the cerebellopontine angle can be a cause of trigeminal neuralgia, particularly if there is loss of sensation in trigeminal territory - sometimes called atypical trigeminal neuralgia . About 5% of people with trigeminal neuralgia have other family members with the disorder, which suggests a possible genetic cause in some cases . Because there are no objective tests for trigeminal neuralgia, clinical manifestations are the mainstay of diagnosis . Trigeminal neuralgia is more prevalent in women than men by a ratio of 3:2 . It can occur at any age, but usually has its onset in individuals over 50 years old . Clinical features . Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal and recurrent attacks of facial pain that are sudden and unilateral, and that follow the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve . Patients describe the severe, often excruciating, pain as sharp, stabbing or burning in quality, usually lasting between seconds and less than 2 minutes . A few progress to less intense persistent pain between paroxysms . Attacks can occur up to 70 times daily, terrifying patients because of their severity and unpredictability despite their brief duration . Other diagnoses such as idiopathic (atypical) facial pain, muscular pain, dental pain or one of the headache syndromes (exempli gratia cluster headache or migraine) should be considered if the pain is bilateral or continuous and if there are no evident provoking factors . Rarely, a combination of trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headache may occur (cluster tic syndrome) (see Chapter 12) . The most important diagnostic imaging technique is MRI . MRI can identify benign or malignant lesions or plaques of MS . In general, 1 in 3 individuals receiving carbamazepine will experience pain relief . Other options include the gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin), particularly in older people or in patients who are unable to tolerate carbamazepine . In patients with unresponsive pain, it may be necessary to use a systemic infusion of lidocaine (lignocaine), aiming for a blood concentration of 1-2 μg/mL . Invasive procedures . If medical management has failed and the patient can tolerate surgery, microvascular decompression of the trigeminal neural complex (also known as the Jannetta procedure) is the preferred treatment . This procedure directly treats the cause of the problem without destroying any neural tissue . Pain relief persists in more than 85% of patients at 5-year follow-up, with no risk of sensory loss . Many patients have complete abolition of pain - a result that is attainable for very few chronic pain conditions . This is a rapid and highly controllable procedure that aims to minimize risk of sensory loss . However, pain tends to recur after about 3 years and about 5% of patients have painful sensory loss (anesthesia dolorosa) . Balloon compression and retro-Gasserian glycerol injection are alternative lesioning procedures . Patients who elect to undergo repeat procedures should be informed of the increased risks . Because of the severity and unpredictability of episodes of trigeminal neuralgia, patients with ineffective treatment pain are at increased risk of suicide . Risk of suicide is discussed in Fast Facts: Depression . The authors of this text have treated many patients with trigeminal neuralgia who fail to respond to medical management or who have unacceptable side effects . Such patients must be given access to the invasive procedures described above, particularly microvascular decompression (MVD), in view of the high success rate . However, MVD requires a neurosurgeon of high experience in the MVD technique . ","Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal and recurrent attacks of facial pain that are sudden and unilateral, and follow the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Pain is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal ganglion or its branches. Medical management remains the first line of treatment. Carbamazepine, traditionally the drug of choice, is often replaced by gabapentin and pregabalin because of fewer side effects. Patients hospitalized because of the severity of pain may be effectively controlled by use of a subcutaneous infusion of lidocaine (lignocaine). Failed medical treatment is an indication for consideration of microvascular decompression or alternative techniques."
9781908541994,ch04,"Acne often occurs at an age when an individual is experiencing significant psychological and social changes . It is therefore not surprising that acne often leads to loss of self-esteem, anxiety, problems mixing with peers and, at times, significant depression . Patients with acne also have greater employment difficulties than the general population; in one survey, 22% of respondents believed that they had been turned down for a job because of their skin . Studies assessing independent reactions to photographs of patients with acne and acne scarring, versus no acne or acne scarring, have identified that people with acne and scars are perceived more negatively . In some studies of patients with severe acne, the levels of social, psychological and emotional problems were as great as those reported by patients with conditions such as chronic disabling asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, back pain or arthritis . Acne may also be a predisposing factor for anorexia; vulnerable teenagers may adopt an extreme diet in an attempt to control their acne . Depression and suicidal ideation have been studied in patients with a variety of skin conditions, including acne . The incidence of suicidal ideation found in 72 patients with mild-to-moderate acne was 5.6%; the incidence among general medical patients is 2.4-3.3% . For many patients, the psychological and social effects of acne motivate them to seek professional consultation and treatment . However, patients' parents or physicians do not always fully appreciate the psychosocial effects of the condition, which is frequently dismissed as merely a cosmetic problem . Health professionals need to be aware of the significant variation in the degree of psychological distress that acne causes in different people and to appreciate the differences in patients' coping skills . Clinicians may be dismissive about a mild case of acne, yet the patient may exhibit significant psychopathology . In fact, many studies have shown that a patient's dissatisfaction with their facial appearance significantly correlates with their own rating of acne severity, rather than the rating determined by their clinician . Assessing psychosocial effect . Several simple generic and dermatology-specific questionnaires are available to better understand the psychosocial effect of acne on the patient's life and wellbeing . Quality of life (QoL) measures help to identify patients vulnerable to psychological complications by capturing the complete effect of acne and treatment on the patient's life . Adopting a QoL measure as an integral part of acne management is recommended . Assessment of the Psychosocial Effects of Acne (APSEA; Figure 4.1) has been shown to be effective . The Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI) is another disease-specific tool that has been used in the assessment of acne; although not as sensitive for assessing the psychosocial impact, it is quick to use in clinic . Acne scarring . Several studies in patients with acne before and after treatment have documented improvements in a wide variety of psychological functions as a result of successful treatment . In many patients, the psychosocial disability caused by acne can be reversed with effective treatment . Some patients will require additional support but securing this can be a challenge . In the UK, the patient support group Changing Faces can be helpful for those suffering from psychological and social changes as a result of facial acne (see Useful resources, pages 100-1) . Acne as a symptom of other psychological disorders . Body dysmorphic disorder . A small number of patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) have acne as their prime dysmorphic symptom . The acne is usually mild or non-existent and the patient's complaint does not correlate with the physical signs . These patients are often depressed or have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) behaviors, anxiety and depression . A significant risk of suicide in these patients has been reported . Patients with BDD require significant support and expert dermatological and psychiatric management, as many have global mental disorders . Patients for whom BDD is the only behavioral symptom may gain relief by treating their mild acne aggressively . An atopic background may be evident and patients often complain of significant pruritus in the lesions . The persistent trauma to lesions can result in significant scarring . Treatment can be difficult depending on whether the patient has primary acne lesions or not . If active acne is evident, treatment should be employed to reduce the lesions . Some patients with acne excoriée may just need to break the habit of picking, whilst others may have a compulsive skin picking disorder that requires psychological therapy or psychotropic drug treatments . ","Acne and scarring can cause significant psychosocial disability. Psychological changes should be noted, assessed and taken into account when managing acne. Perception studies have identified that people with acne and/or scarring are perceived more negatively. Validated and recognized questionnaires are available to assess the psychological disability caused by acne. A small number of patients with body dysmorphic disorder have acne as their prime dysmorphic symptom. The acne in these patients is usually mild or non-existent and the patient's complaint does not correlate with the physical signs. Acne excoriée may be alleviated by psychotropic drug treatments, psychological therapy, hypnosis or habit reversal therapy. Acne may be associated with anorexia nervosa."
9781912776238,ch11,"Selection of biosimilars by formulary committees is just the first step to a successful biosimilar program; the economic benefits from biosimilars are only seen if they are used . This requires the assistance of all healthcare professionals and, most importantly, patients and their advocates . Once European biosimilars are approved, local implementation is up to member states, which formulate their own biosimilar policies . The European Commission has organized four large stakeholder meetings on biosimilars, from which several key themes have emerged . communicating with one voice . redesigning pricing and reimbursement policies . To us, being confident about why biosimilars show no clinically meaningful differences to reference biologics comes from two sources . Communicating with one voice . Initial biosimilar programs were hampered because each hospital and clinic often had to work alone . Infliximab represented the greatest regulatory challenge for biosimilars for several reasons . The solution for Norway was to use its Clinical Trials Service to introduce biosimilars as a Phase III trial (Nor-Switch trial; ClinicalTrials . Patients were supported throughout by clinical trial nurse specialists, such that more than half the currently treated patients enrolled and successful clinical outcomes were reported in 2017 . In England, the National Health Service (NHS) has achieved 50% switching rates for cancer therapeutic biosimilars in less than 6 months: this was achieved by investing in a program called the NHS Cancer Vanguard, in which health professionals provided physician and patient support throughout . Funding of health professional salaries for the program came as a gainshare agreement, through which the potential gains from biosimilar cost-savings were shared between payers and providers . As with the Norwegian model, each hospital's switching program was supported with clinical monitoring before and after switching, together with patient satisfaction surveys, while supportive education was provided from a central source . Support materials . The European Council, in collaboration with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has worked to improve understanding of biosimilars in the EU through shared patient and health professional education . For patients, the collaboration produced a document Questions and Answers on Biosimilars for Patients - this time in 23 languages - supported by a video version available in eight major European languages . eu/en/medicines) . Medicines for Europe represents the interests of generic and biosimilar producers . The European Specialist Nurses Organisation has also produced an excellent nurse-led biosimilar switching program; it covers challenging questions that patients might ask, such as 'the biosimilar is cheaper - doesn't that mean it's not as good?' and provides evidence-based model answers . This is supported with a Biosimilars Stakeholder Toolkit, with a variety of patient and prescriber outreach materials, including fact sheets, videos and graphics, as well as drop-in content for web pages to help promote understanding of biosimilars . The Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE) explored drivers of biosimilar uptake and reported that approximately half of European countries have incentives for physicians to prescribe biosimilars . In the USA, where biosimilars are a more recent option, there are less data to share . However, there are already established step-therapy biosimilar policies reported by Network Bulletin . Redesigning pricing and reimbursement policies . In the Europe, drug tenders are covered by competition law that works to open markets . One key legal challenge claims that an originator producer has withheld or threatened to withhold rebates if payers do not list the reference drug in an exclusive preferred position over biosimilars . Furthermore, the pharmaceutical company may have bundled the reference biologic with other agents in deals to exclude biosimilar products from rivals . Manufacturers also have a business case for promoting biosimilars or, conversely, for slowing their uptake . In contrast, biosimilars are deemed by regulators to be either equivalent or not equivalent - a binary decision, with analytics being the dominant driver of that decision . Phase III clinical trials for biosimilars are designed to exclude any significant clinical difference . They are tailored for each drug and use sensitive patient populations and trial endpoints that may be different from the originator's pivotal study . As a result, it may be impossible to directly compare a biosimilar with the originator or, indeed, other biosimilars . Formulary decisions about the choice of biosimilar would then be driven by price and convenience, as is the case for generic drugs . This offers little opportunity to claim technical superiority of one biosimilar over another, as all versions of a drug will have been determined comparable . ","Health professionals and patients need support to understand the issues around biosimilars and to feel confident using them. Many different support materials are available to help health professionals talk to colleagues and patients about biosimilars. Around half of European countries have incentives for physicians to prescribe biosimilars. The regulatory requirements for biosimilars mean that it may not be possible to compare a biosimilar with the originator or with other biosimilars. In this scenario, formulary decisions are driven by price and convenience.

9781908541796,chapter7,"In Europe and the USA, T-cell lymphomas represent about 5% of cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . T cells acquire several identifiable markers during maturation . Precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma . The clinical behavior of this disease is very similar to precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and it typically presents as a large mediastinal mass . Involved tissues typically contain sheets of blast cells that stain with precursor T-cell markers such as CD34, CD2, CD7, CD3 and TdT (Figure 7.1) . Many cases of T-cell ALL/LBL will also stain for CD10 . Clinical presentation . In patients with ALL, fatigue, breathlessness, infection and bleeding are more usual . Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is one of the few T-cell disorders that typically behaves in an indolent fashion . Clinical presentation . Some patients present with autoimmune features reminiscent of rheumatoid arthritis, while others will present with neutropenia . Patients in whom LGL leukemia is an incidental finding may require no specific therapy . Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma . The cells express CD4 and CD25 (IL-2 receptor) . Clinical presentation . Patients are usually middle-aged and present with widespread lymphadenopathy, enlargement of the liver and spleen, and often skin involvement . In most cases, there is involvement of the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and occasionally the white cell count may be extremely high . CNS involvement is a devastating complication that most often occurs on relapse . A small number of patients have disease with a more indolent course . Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified . Most cases exhibit a CD4+ positive T-cell phenotype, though, as with all T-cell lymphomas, there may be much heterogeneity in antigen expression (Figure 7.4) . Clinical presentation . Treatment is with CHOP or equivalent chemotherapy . In many patients, however, disease progression occurs during treatment, and salvage chemotherapy proceeding to high-dose therapy is required . Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma . The T-cell anaplastic large-cell lymphomas can be divided according to whether the tumor is localized to the skin (primary cutaneous T-cell anaplastic lymphoma) or whether the tumor cell expresses anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) (Table 7.4) . The malignant cells are characteristically large and express the T-cell marker CD3 together with CD30 . Clinical presentation . The localized cutaneous anaplastic large-cell tumor does not usually express translocated ALK . Angio-immunoblastic lymphoma . In addition, there may be a proliferation of mature B cells, including plasma cells, which presumably generate the high levels of immunoglobulin found in patients with this disorder . Evidence suggests that the malignant T cell may be derived from the follicular T cell, which would certainly help explain the B-cell stimulation that occurs . The disease is usually very aggressive and the optimal treatment has not been defined . Enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma . Many patients succumb early in the course of disease because of their poor nutritional state . It is also clear that, in many patients, the enteropathy is diagnosed at the time of lymphoma presentation . Such cells typically express CD3, CD7 and CD103, but are often negative for CD4 and CD8 . Initial management may involve surgical resection followed by combination chemotherapy, usually CHOP . Supportive care is crucial for such patients, because of their poor nutritional state . Natural killer cell ('nasal') lymphoma . They appear to be more common in patients from Southeast Asia . Some patients present with systemic involvement, sometimes with circulating malignant cells in the peripheral blood, and skin involvement . Clinical presentation . Patients present with nasal stuffiness, nasal discharge or more obvious evidence of bony destruction . The tumor is often resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy . Most patients survive for only a few months . Clinical presentation . For more generalized skin involvement, phototherapy is the treatment of choice in combination with psoralens . ","T-cell lymphomas comprise only 5% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases in Western countries. T-cell lymphomas often involve the skin. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas present with widespread small-volume lymphadenopathy, but with marked systemic symptoms. Most T-cell lymphomas are aggressive and often progress during treatment."
9781908541406,ch_4,"Bleeding events such as nose bleeds, large bruises and heavy menses are often elicited by a thorough history . It is the clinician's responsibility to discern which patients actually have a clinically significant bleeding disorder that may predispose to excessive, troublesome or potentially serious bleeding . It is usually easy to distinguish clinically between a severe bleeding disorder and a mild bleeding disorder in that the former bleed frequently and spontaneously with minimal provocation, whilst the latter bleed only occasionally . It may be much harder to distinguish those with a mild bleeding disorder from those who are 'normal', even after extensive clinical and laboratory evaluation . Laboratory investigation of the patient's blood involves screening tests, measuring the concentration of specific clotting factors and assessing platelet function . Taking the history . Site of bleed . Duration of bleeding . Bleeding symptoms over a long period of time suggest a lifelong congenital bleeding disorder, while those of recent origin may be more in keeping with an acquired medical disorder (exempli gratia liver disease) . Difficulties may arise in individuals with mild congenital bleeding disorders who only bleed after surgery and who may, therefore, remain undiagnosed until adulthood, especially now that circumcision, tonsillectomy and dental extractions are performed less often in childhood . Bleeding that arises spontaneously reflects the presence of a more severe bleeding state than hemorrhage that occurs only after surgery or trauma . It can also be helpful to know when bleeding starts after surgery . Bleeding that starts immediately indicates a platelet abnormality or von Willebrand disease . Family history . A positive family history of a bleeding disorder can be helpful in directing investigations (exempli gratia hemophilia) . Furthermore, in a mild bleeding disorder the degree of bleeding symptoms may vary among different members of the family because of the co-inheritance of other causes of a mild bleeding state . Medical conditions that predispose to bleeding, such as renal or liver failure, paraproteinemia and collagenoses, should be considered . Acutely ill patients often have multiple reasons for bleeding (exempli gratia septicemia, uremia and the effect of drugs) . Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) is widely used as an antithrombotic; it induces a mild predisposition to bleeding in most individuals and may unmask an underlying lifelong mild bleeding disorder . Assessment of children . Any child presenting with unexpected bleeding should be carefully and immediately assessed, especially in relation to any family history of a bleeding disorder or if the clinical circumstances suggest the possibility of non-accidental injury . Bleeding scores are being developed and evaluated as potentially useful quantitative clinical indices that summarize the number and severity of bleeding episodes . Weighted values are given for epistaxis, bleeding from minor wounds, gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia, muscle and joint hemorrhages and surgical bleeding . To date, bleeding scores have mainly been research tools but some, such as the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool (ISTH-BAT), are being validated for clinical use . Superficial examination . Hemophilia is characterized by acute hemarthroses or evidence of previous joint damage from recurrent bleeds . General examination . If severe thrombocytopenia is suspected, the optic fundi should be examined for evidence of retinal bleeding . The extent of the investigations will depend on the likelihood of the patient having a bleeding disorder as determined by the history and physical examination . If the history is not particularly suggestive of a bleeding disorder, these investigations may be sufficient (and will exclude most severe bleeding disorders) . If the platelet count and morphology are normal, but a platelet function disorder is suspected, further investigation is necessary . Bleeding time . In disorders of primary hemostasis the cutaneous bleeding time may be prolonged, but this is not always the case . Bleeding time is not a good test of platelet or VWF function (partly because it is invasive and very difficult to standardize), and is little used these days . Platelet function analyzer (PFA)-100 test . It reliably reflects the effects of ASA (aspirin) on platelet function, but may be normal in patients with mild hemostatic defects; therefore, a normal test should not be used to exclude platelet function defects in individuals with a positive bleeding history . It should be noted that FXII deficiency is not associated with a predisposition to bleeding . ","A full and detailed history of personal and family bleeding symptoms often indicates the nature and severity of a potential bleeding diathesis. All current and recent drugs should be reviewed as possible causes of a bleeding state. Specific inquiry should be made about oral anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists, or inhibitors of thrombin or factor (F)Xa or other antithrombotic therapy (exempli gratia acetylsalicylic acid [ASA, aspirin]). Defects of primary hemostasis (id est platelet disorders and von Willebrand disease) present with mucosal bleeding (exempli gratia epistaxis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and menorrhagia). Defects of secondary hemostasis (id est coagulation disorders such as hemophilia) usually present with hemarthroses and muscle hematoma."
9781908541796,chapter4,"This chapter offers a broad overview of staging and management of a patient with lymphoma; Chapters 5-9 provide a more detailed discussion of the individual lymphoma entities, while Chapters 10 and give detail of treatment modalities and the management of treatment side effects .

Staging system . stage I: involvement of a single group of lymph nodes . Staging also takes into account the presence of 'B symptoms' . B symptoms are . night sweats that drench and wake the patient . Absence of B symptoms makes the patient stage A . verbal and written information about the disorder and its treatment . Treatment options may include . chemotherapy (single agent or combination) . high-dose therapy with stem-cell support . Combination chemotherapy generally improves the response rate compared with single-agent treatment . Many drugs are active against lymphoma, but perhaps the best known combination is CHOP . In view of this, the treatment paradigm for patients with indolent lymphomas is changing . For younger fitter patients, the advent of new therapies has improved survival and a more active approach to therapy is typical for these patients now (see below) . Single-agent oral chemotherapy, for example with an alkylating agent, can be effective in inducing a partial response and thereby improves the patient's symptoms and general wellbeing . Advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (stages IIB-IV) must be treated with combination chemotherapy . Management of side effects . Patients with a history of depressive or other mental illness are particularly at risk . Some patients may become psychotic and require expert psychiatric management . Hair loss occurs with several chemotherapy drugs . The impact of chemotherapy on fertility is important and must be discussed before treatment starts . All men receiving chemotherapy who may wish to have children should be given the option of sperm storage . Both the type and the dosing regimen of chemotherapy determine the impact of treatment on fertility . Management of bone-marrow suppression . A very important aspect of the delivery of chemotherapy is the likely effect on the patient's normal blood count . Patients with low platelet counts can be given platelet transfusions . Patients who develop a fever following chemotherapy need urgent assessment and may need hospital admission to receive intravenous antibiotics . Response to chemotherapy . The response to chemotherapy determines the subsequent management of the patient . The most recent response criteria adopted for lymphomas include the use of functional imaging, with PET scans for patients in clinical trials . At present, six cycles of chemotherapy is regarded as the standard of care . One of the central dilemmas of lymphoma management is the interpretation of residual masses following chemotherapy (Figure 4.4) . Not all residual masses that are present after chemotherapy or radiotherapy contain active disease . Indeed, 60% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma are found to have residual masses on completion of chemotherapy . Clearly, if there is active lymphoma, the mass will usually have grown . Biopsy is usually recommended to ensure that the lymphoma has not changed . Biopsy must be followed by full staging . Patients who relapse after initial therapy will usually be given a different chemotherapy regimen . In this situation, patients will usually be offered platinum-based chemotherapy (see pages 55 and) followed by high-dose therapy and stem-cell rescue . For indolent lymphomas, relapse may or may not require active therapy . If required, treatment with a different class or combination of chemotherapy is administered . However, a more aggressive approach may be indicated in younger patients . ","Extranodal lymphomas must be monitored during and after treatment to assess response to therapy. Staging is mandatory in the management of lymphoma. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a valuable staging investigation for patients with many subtypes of lymphoma. When staging investigations have been completed, the patient and relatives must be fully informed of the nature of the condition and the likely treatment plan, and given opportunities to ask questions. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of management. Neutropenic sepsis is a life-threatening complication of chemotherapy and requires urgent assessment. Fertility is an important consideration in any patient of childbearing age receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients who relapse should be considered for re-biopsy and complete restaging."
9781908541727,ch10,"In some ways, children's eye problems may have greater consequences than eye problems in adults, because some conditions, if neglected, may cause amblyopia ('lazy eye') which can reduce the vision in one or both eyes for the whole of the patient's life . In addition, life-threatening problems such as eye or brain tumors can, rarely, present with a squint ('turned eye'), poor red reflex or poor vision in an infant or child . Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist when indicated is essential if the potentially serious consequences of children's eye problems are to be avoided . an infant with persisting eye watering or a slight sticky discharge from one or both eyes, with no eye redness, photophobia or corneal clouding or enlargement (likely to be congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction) . Eye discharge or watering . Ophthalmia neonatorum . Congenital glaucoma does not cause red eyes, but does result in corneal and eye enlargement . Corneal clouding may develop, and the child may have constant watering of the eye/s and photophobia (aversion to bright lights) . Prompt surgical treatment can save the child's sight . It presents as persistent watering or sticky discharge from one or both eyes, without eye redness, photophobia, or corneal enlargement or clouding . This often corrects itself within the first year to 18 months of life . Children of all ages may develop the usual types of conjunctivitis (viral, allergic and bacterial; see Chapter 2) . Suspected poor vision . A normal and healthy infant usually makes eye contact with the parent in the first 8-12 weeks of life . Poor vision in one or both eyes may also present with a noticeable squint or nystagmus (see below) . A critical difference between childhood and adult vision is that children less than 9 years old with poor vision in one or both eyes from any cause, or one eye constantly turned from squint, will not develop normal connections between the affected eye/s and the developing visual cortex . This poor connection will result in permanent poor vision from amblyopia, even if the original eye problem is later corrected . The earlier a child with poor vision in one or both eyes is referred to an ophthalmologist, the better the chance of preventing permanent visual loss . In the case of a squint, amblyopia may often be partially or fully corrected by patching the 'good' eye under close ophthalmic supervision . For these reasons, the ophthalmic assessment of children with poor vision is a matter of some urgency . Abnormal red reflex or 'white pupil' . This also allows a direct comparison of the red reflex in both eyes at the same time . A red reflex test should be performed on any child with a squint, apparently poor vision or any other eye problem . Squint ('turned eye', strabismus) . Squint is never 'normal', and the vast majority of children with squint do not 'grow out' of it . Any child with a squint should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist to determine its underlying cause . Poor vision itself (including serious causes such as malignant retinoblastoma in one or both eyes, or congenital cataracts) can cause squint . Conversely, squint can cause poor vision, because an eye that is constantly turned will develop amblyopia . Children with squints usually do not (if they are old enough to talk) complain of double vision, because their brain 'switches off' the image from the deviated eye . Children can develop squint from all the same causes as adults, including third, fourth or sixth nerve palsies from brain tumor, inflammation or infection . These squints occur for an unknown reason in otherwise healthy children, and often can be partially or fully corrected with squint surgery, after refractive error has been treated with glasses and any amblyopia has been corrected with patching . Nystagmus (continually moving eyes) . Other children born with normal eyes and normal visual pathways develop nystagmus because of an inherited eye motor control problem . Nystagmus in children can also occur for all the same reasons as in adults, including brain tumors or middle-ear disease . Optic disc abnormalities . Abnormal optic discs in children always require ophthalmic assessment . ","Refer urgently, to be seen the same day, if your patient is:- a neonate with red eyes and eye watering or discharge (possible ophthalmia neonatorum)- a neonate or child with an abnormal red reflex (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract)- an infant or child with photophobia, constant tearing (epiphora), corneal enlargement or cloudy cornea (possible congenital glaucoma)- a child with red eye with pain, photophobia or blurred vision (possible corneal ulcer, iritis or endophthalmitis)- an older child with double vision (causes include brain tumor or aneurysm)- a child of any age with swollen optic disc/s on ophthalmoscopy (possible brain tumor or hydrocephalus).- an infant or child with preseptal or orbital cellulitis- an infant or child with ptosis- an infant or child with a history of eye trauma or possible shaken baby syndrome.

9783318066241,ch9,"Two in every 10 patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) will experience a recurrence . This chapter we will address which etiologies that are more prone to recurrence and how to avoid it . Most patients with AP will have a complete recovery, but sequelae can develop, especially in moderate-to-severe disease . Prevention of recurrence . Correctly diagnosing the etiology of AP is important in guiding appropriate action to prevent the patient experiencing a recurrence . In affected patients, cholecystectomy is indicated after an episode of AP to prevent recurrence of these other complications of gallstone disease . AP in the presence of gallbladder sludge, polyps or cholesterolosis is also an indication for cholecystectomy . In patients with mild AP, many observational studies have reported a high risk of recurrence associated with a delay in cholecystectomny . Observational studies suggest that it still lowers the risk of AP recurrence and even mortality in this population . In patients with local complications, the timing of cholecystectomy is controversial . Based on these data, it is currently recommended that cholecystectomy should be delayed in patients with local complications . Any decision to perform an endoscopic sphincterotomy before delayed cholecystectomy and the subsequent timing for cholecystectomy in such patients should be made on an individual case basis . Patients with resectable solid and cystic tumors of the pancreas associated with AP should undergo surgery . These procedures are associated with a high risk of AP after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and there are currently no RCTs showing a subsequent reduction in the rate of AP . Avoidance of alcohol is associated with a lower rate of recurrent AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis . The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines on initial management of AP recommend a brief alcohol intervention during admission . For the patients, it is usually easier to stop drinking than smoking . According to a retrospective study, triglyceride levels greater than 200 mg/dL are associated with a higher frequency of recurrent AP after an episode of hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP . Other etiologies . Withdrawing drugs associated with AP should be considered in otherwise idiopathic pancreatitis, but in the authors' experience drug-induced pancreatitis is rare and recurrence is frequent . Specific treatment should be given to patients with hyperparathyroidism and autoimmune pancreatitis . There are no effective measures against recurrence in truly idiopathic AP . Late complications . Some patients will experience significant late complications following an episode of AP, including . progression to recurrent and chronic pancreatitis . The inflammation and damage to the exocrine pancreas associated with AP can affect the gland's endocrine tissue . According to a recent systematic review, 23% of patients with AP will develop diabetes and 15% will be insulin dependent . Risk factors for diabetes are severe AP (39%), necrotizing AP (37%) and alcohol-related AP (28% vs only 12% in gallstone-associated AP) . Patients with diabetes subsequent to AP should be treated in the same manner as others with this metabolic complication . Again, risk factors for this complication were severe AP, necrotizing AP and alcohol-related AP . According to another systematic review, steatorrhea (a major symptom of EPI) subsequent to AP was present in 11% of patients at follow-up within 12 months, 33% at 12-36 months and 33% at 36 months or longer . Patients with clinical steatorrhea should receive pancreatic enzyme replacement treatment (PERT) directly . Recurrent AP and chronic pancreatitis . Approximately 21% of patients with a first attack of AP will have a recurrence, including 38% of patients with alcoholic AP and 17% with biliary AP . Ten percent of patients with a first episode of AP will develop chronic pancreatitis, including 36% of cases with recurrent AP, 65% of cases with an alcohol-related etiology and 61% of tobacco-related AP cases, compared with only 9% in biliary AP . Male sex is also associated with an increased risk of chronic pancreatitis . The detection and treatment or avoidance of etiologic factors for AP is the cornerstone of preventing recurrent and chronic pancreatitis and a holistic approach has been proposed to avoid progression . ","The correct diagnosis of the etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is important to prevent recurrence. Endoscopic ultrasonography is very useful in patients with an obscure etiology after anamnesis, laboratory findings and conventional ultrasonography. Diabetes, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, recurrence and progression to chronic pancreatitis are frequent consequences of AP."
9781905832729,ch_8,"The majority of patients will not benefit from antibiotic treatment, and it is thus not indicated . However, it is important to treat asymptomatic infections in a small number of patient groups, as summarized in Table 7.1 . Recurrent urinary tract infection . Anaerobic infections of the urinary tract are rare . In the elderly patient, mental changes, malaise and confusion may be the only presenting symptoms of a UTI . iii) to empty the bladder fully at least once a day should be recommended for patients with large postvoid residual volumes . The majority of investigations, however, will be normal, and treatment should be on the basis of symptoms . Patients should void frequently and completely, and women should be advised to void before bed and after sexual intercourse . A Cochrane review found that cranberry products significantly reduced the incidence of UTIs over 12 months . Antibiotic treatment is recommended for patients with recurrent UTIs . However, urine culture before treatment is important, given the widespread resistance to antibiotics . A continuous regimen of low-dose antibiotics can be used as prophylaxis against further infections in selected patients . Breakthrough infections should be treated with full doses of appropriate antibiotics . However, some patients may need to continue daily prophylaxis for life . An alternative to prophylaxis is to allow patients to self-medicate . Patients are provided with 3 days' full-dose antibiotic treatment to take when they experience the symptoms of acute cystitis; the symptoms of UTIs can be accurately identified by 85% of women . Bladder pain syndrome and interstitial cystitis . The diagnosis of IC is confined to patients with painful bladder symptoms who have characteristic cystoscopic and histological features . It is commonly accepted that IC predominates in women . These changes are generally considered to be late changes, and many patients with BPS/IC have no specific cystoscopic findings . The diagnosis of BPS/IC is based clinically on symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency and pain . Pain is an essential component of both conditions and is traditionally described as increasing pain on bladder filling that is relieved by voiding . Diagnosis of BPS or IC requires the exclusion of other causes of the bladder symptoms, such as infection, malignancy, radiation or drug-induced cystitis . These cystoscopic findings are not necessarily diagnostic, however, as not all patients with petechial hemorrhages have IC, and vice versa . There is some disagreement about the role of cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in the diagnosis of IC . The natural history of the disorder is not fully understood, and the proportion of patients whose symptoms will resolve spontaneously is not known . Treatment is not always necessary if a patient's symptoms are tolerable and do not impact significantly on quality of life; there are few data to show that treatment will significantly alter the natural history of the disorder . However, patients who present with BPS/IC should receive behavior modification treatment, as described in Table 7.4 . Options for treatment are summarized in Tables 7.4 and 7.5 . A wide variety of foods has been implicated and special diets for patients with BPS/IC are provided in patient information . Not all foods affect all patients in the same way so it is important to advise patients to avoid only those foods that affect them . Behavioral changes . Modifying certain behaviors can improve symptoms in some IC/BPS patients and can reduce the frequency of voiding . Oral treatments . Tricyclic antidepressants used in the treatment of BPS/IC are listed in Table 7.6 . It has been used in the treatment of BPS/IC and is useful in the management of pain at a titrated dose of up to 75 mg daily . Several drugs are available for intravesical therapy of BPS/IC . Long-term remission will be achieved in some patients with this approach, but in most the condition will relapse eventually and require additional treatments . Treatment with intravesical agents does not require anesthesia or hospital admission, and some patients can be taught to self-administer the drugs . Invasive treatment should be reserved for patients with debilitating symptoms in whom conservative treatments have failed . It may be helpful for the symptoms of urgency and frequency but does not appear to improve pain associated with BPS/IC . However, results are generally poor for classic BPS/IC . Urinary tract infections and cystitis . ","Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as a further UTI after resolution of initial bacteriuria. At least 20-30% of women will have a UTI at some time, 25% of whom will develop recurrent UTI. UTIs are relatively rare in men and are more likely to have a significant cause than in women. Urinalysis is quick and easy. A positive test should be followed up by microscopy, and the urine cultured to determine antimicrobial sensitivity. Treatment of UTIs is largely on the basis of symptoms and any underlying identified cause. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for recurrent UTI; prophylactic antibiotics and self-medication should also be considered. Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is characterized by suprapubic pain relating to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms such as frequency, in the absence of a proven UTI or other pathology. The diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) is confined to patients with bladder pain symptoms with characteristic cytoscopic and histological features. The etiology of BPS/IC is largely unknown. The roles of cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in the diagnosis of BPS/IC are controversial. Management of BPS/IC is largely conservative, and includes dietary advice, behavioral therapies, and oral and intravesical medication."
9781910797662,ch05,"Treatment is based on a risk-stratified approach that takes into account multiple prognostic factors associated with a risk of recurrence and progression to muscle-invasive disease . Initial surgical management . Initial reports suggested a similar association with reduction in recurrence risk but this was not confirmed by a large international trial, except in patients with low-risk disease . whether this is the first occurrence or a recurrent tumor . presence or absence of CIS . Patients are stratified into risk groups for progression, based on low grade to high grade or non-invasive to invasive cancer . Low-risk tumors . Patients with a solitary low-grade Ta lesion are at low risk of recurrence or progression . Induction chemotherapy (intravesical therapy weekly for 6 weeks) is not indicated for patients with low-risk disease . Patients who develop a recurrence of similar stage and grade are classified as intermediate risk and have been shown to benefit from intravesical chemotherapy . Intermediate-risk tumors . Patients with multiple or recurrent low-grade Ta tumors are at intermediate risk of recurrence or progression . These patients should receive a course of intravesical therapy following resection (see below) . BCG induction plus maintenance for 1 year is also an option . High-risk tumors . Patients who present with CIS and/or HG papillary tumors (Ta or T1) have an 80% risk of recurrence and progression rates of 40-70% . BCG is the standard of care; level-I evidence supports induction therapy weekly for 6 weeks, followed by maintenance treatment weekly for 3 weeks at months 3 and 6 and then at 6-month intervals to 3 years . Recurrence with a HG tumor after two induction courses (6 weeks + 6 weeks) or induction plus first maintenance therapy (6 weeks + 3 weeks) are deemed BCG unresponsive and should not receive further BCG . Intravesical therapy . Optimal treatment requires complete resection of all visible papillary disease (Ta and T1) before initiating intravesical therapy . BCG provides optimal therapeutic benefit for the eradication of CIS . keeping the patient fasted throughout treatment in order to minimize urine production . Monthly maintenance treatment for 10 months reduces the probability of recurrence in patients who have an initial complete response . Intravesical immunotherapy with BCG was first reported to decrease papillary tumor recurrence in 1976 . BCG is the most effective agent for prevention of both recurrence and tumor progression . BCG immunotherapy is also highly effective in CIS: induction plus maintenance therapy results in complete remission of disease in up to 85% of patients . For this reason, BCG immunotherapy is generally used only for first-line treatment in patients with high-risk disease, and as a second-line therapy for patients with intermediate-risk disease that continues to recur after adequate intravesical chemotherapy . Glashan first reported a complete response in 45% of patients with CIS following intravesical administration of interferon alfa-2b, 100 mega units weekly for 12 weeks . While BCG alone is the standard of care for patients with a first occurrence of a high-risk tumor, BCG in combination with interferon may be useful for patients with disease recurrence after an initial course of BCG . Surveillance following initial diagnosis and treatment . Routine surveillance for NMIBC with cystoscopy can be risk adjusted . Patients with a normal cystoscopy 3 months after TURBT for low-risk disease should have a repeat cystoscopy within 9 months and then, if normal, annually thereafter for up to 5 years . Intermediate-risk patients should have cystoscopy every 3 months for 1-2 years, then annually for up to 5 years . If recurrence is detected, the patient returns to the start of this schedule . Patients with high-risk disease should have cystoscopy every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for a year and annually for up to 5 years thereafter . As late recurrence can occur, lifelong surveillance is recommended, particularly for patients with high-risk tumors . In the UK, patients who have had low- and intermediate-risk tumors are often discharged from follow-up after 10 years without recurrence . For patients with HG tumors, either papillary or CIS, voided or bladder wash cytology should be performed as an adjunct to cystoscopy . Tumor markers . ","Risk-adapted treatment is based on accurate determination of stage, grade, number of tumors and presence of carcinoma in situ, and stratified as primary versus recurrent disease. Tumors can be classified into low-, intermediate- and high-risk based on these factors; these risk strata drive treatment decisions and surveillance recommendations. Low-risk tumors may recur but are unlikely to progress. Peri-operative single-dose chemotherapy reduces recurrence, and patients may only need cystoscopic follow-up. Intermediate-risk tumors are more likely to recur and have a modest progression risk. A course of intravesical chemotherapy will reduce the risk of recurrence but not of progression. Optimized mitomycin treatment is associated with optimal outcomes. Induction with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) followed by maintenance for 1 year is also a standard of care. High-risk bladder cancer is likely to recur and, unless adequately treated, to progress. It is fatal in up to 30% of patients. Intravesical BCG induction plus maintenance for 3 years is standard of care. Radical cystectomy is indicated for patients with high-risk disease that is unresponsive to BCG, if the patient is medically fit and accepts the risks."
9781912776818,hh-5,"Clinical overlap can occur between these conditions and definitive laboratory testing can be time-consuming at a time when patients are usually critically ill and require immediate treatment . STEC-HUS (typical or diarrhea-associated HUS) . HUS is defined by the simultaneous occurrence of TMA with acute kidney injury . Renal involvement is typically much more severe than with TTP and the patient often presents with oliguria or anuria . Traditionally, HUS was divided into diarrhea-positive and diarrhea-negative, but this is now known to be inaccurate as patients with aHUS may also present with diarrhea . STEC-HUS is the most common form of HUS . It is primarily caused by STEC infection (E . It can occur at any age, but it usually affects children younger than 5 years . It can occur sporadically or as an epidemic and is associated with ingestion of contaminated food or water . The TMA most commonly follows recovery from the acute diarrheal illness . Treatment is usually supportive and includes intravenous fluids and transfusion support . Etiologies for aHUS include complement gene mutations (complement factor H [CFH] has the most common and most severe mutation) and antibodies to CFH that lead to an inability to control complement activation after it has been triggered for a normal physiological reason (for example, infection, pregnancy) . Presentation can be similar to that of STEC-HUS, with acute renal failure and acute TMA findings . However, this has been shown to be unreliable in differentiating between the two, as patients with aHUS may present with neurological injury . A definitive diagnosis of aHUS can be confirmed by detection of complement gene mutations or antibodies to factor H if present, but up to 40% of individuals with aHUS may not have a detectable complement mutation . Drug-induced TMA . Injury occurs via quinine-dependent antibodies against platelets, endothelial and other cell types . ADAMTS13 levels are typically normal . Most patients recover normal renal function within several weeks simply by stopping the drug and with supportive care . TMA can develop during the first few weeks of treatment and usually resolves with discontinuation of the drug . The following may present with acute TMA findings and may need to be excluded clinically before a diagnosis of TTP or aHUS can be made . Fibrinogen may be reduced in very severe DIC . Systemic infections . Other than STEC, TMA can be seen secondary to severe Streptococcus pneumoniae infection with either severe pneumonia or meningitis; it is usually seen in children . Solid organ and stem-cell transplant TMA . TMA may occur through a mixture of mechanisms, including drug toxicity from the immunosuppressing agents mentioned above, severe infections or, in the case of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease . A TMA associated with stem-cell transplant that is clinically similar to aHUS also occurs . These are usually associated with progressive or metastatic disease, commonly with hepatic involvement . Pregnancy-associated TMA . Systemic lupus erythematosus can present similarly to iTTP in rare cases . ADAMTS13 activity in these cases would be low and patients are treated as other patients with iTTP, with additional intervention for the underlying SLE . To complicate matters further, aHUS can have accelerated hypertension as a clinical presentation . Therefore, routine screening for B12 and folate levels should be undertaken in acute TMA presentations . Sickle cell disease . HIT causes thrombocytopenia and platelet activation, leading to venous and arterial thrombi . Immune-mediated TTP . The finding of ADAMTS13 activity below 10 IU/dL confirms the diagnosis of TTP . The suspicion for cTTP will also depend on age at presentation . Mutation studies can then be used to confirm a cTTP diagnosis . During early childhood, the differential diagnosis includes STEC-HUS, aHUS and secondary TMA associated with diseases of early childhood . Childhood ITP is usually acute, often occurring after a viral infection or vaccination, and usually resolves spontaneously within weeks to months . TMA is not a common feature and anemia is not pronounced unless there is significant bleeding . ","The thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are a group of disorders that share common clinical characteristics and findings, but with differing pathobiologies that lead to the TMA presentation. Individuals with hemolytic uremic syndrome and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome typically present with more severe renal injury or renal failure compared with individuals with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Quinine, ciclosporin and tacrolimus can induce TMAs via an immune-mediated mechanism (quinine) or dose-dependent toxicity. Systemic disorders that can secondarily present with TMA findings include disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis/infection and autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus). Diseases that present with significant thrombocytopenia mimicking a systemic TMA that should be considered in the differential diagnosis include myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria."

The disorder is characterized by thrombocytopenia, large platelets and impaired binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) . Defects in platelet storage organelles or granules . Dysfunction of cytosolic enzymes and other platelet constituents . Patients with inherited platelet function defects should avoid ASA (aspirin) and other drugs that alter platelet function . Some of the inherited platelet disorders, such as the gray platelet syndrome, may respond temporarily to treatment with desmopressin . If platelet transfusions are needed, single-donor platelets are usually preferred . Acquired disorders . Defective platelet function can be caused by alcohol, drugs, uremia and myeloproliferative disorders . Minoxidil inhibits the synthesis of platelet prostaglandins . Megakaryocytes proliferate, resulting in an increased number of circulating platelets, which may have defective function . Thrombotic events are more common than bleeding, which occurs in about 4% of patients . Spontaneous bleeding and bleeding requiring medical attention usually indicate that the platelet count is less than 10 x 10 /L . Under these conditions, automated counters do not recognize platelets and record a spuriously low platelet count . However, clumps of platelets may be seen on the feather-edge of blood films, indicating a higher platelet count than that reported . Examination of the blood smear will also provide information about platelet size . Small platelets occur in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome . Postoperative thrombocytopenias are usually dilutional, because replacement fluids lack platelets, and often resolve within a few days .

The thrombocytopenia usually resolves within 1-2 weeks . Thrombocytopenia associated with hepatitis C virus and HIV . Platelet counts will often increase gradually when effective antiretroviral therapy is given . A more rapid increase in platelet count occurs with infusions of anti-D or IVIg . Iatrogenic causes of thrombocytopenia . Drugs implicated in thrombocytopenia either decrease platelet production or induce platelet-directed antibodies . In a strong antibody response the antibodies cross-react with the patient's own platelets and produce a severe thrombocytopenia . Management of thrombocytopenia .

Platelets may be obtained by plateletpheresis (single-donor platelets) or retrieved from donated whole blood (random-donor platelets) . This will also give some indication of the recovery and survival of the infused platelets . Infusion of platelets can be associated with allergic reactions, which can be minimized by depleting the platelets of accompanying white cells . Platelet products must also be screened for bacterial contamination . Platelet sensitization is uncommon, even with random-donor platelets; if platelet alloimmunization develops, platelet cross-matching and giving HLA-matched platelets can be helpful . ","Thrombocytopenia may occur with some inherited disorders of platelet function, such as the Bernard-Soulier, gray platelet and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes. Inhibitors of platelet function, such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), should be avoided in individuals with disorders of platelet function and those with thrombocytopenia. In immune thrombocytopenia, bleeding is uncommon if the platelet count exceeds 10 x 10 /L and aggressive interventions (exempli gratia high-dose corticosteroids, splenectomy) are not usually indicated. Gestational thrombocytopenia is common and requires no treatment, but it must be distinguished from primary immune thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusion has limited indications and should be used sparingly, because it may transmit infection or sensitize the recipient to platelet antigens."
9781910797587,chp03,"The joints most commonly affected are the . first metatarsophalangeal joint . OA is not an acquired disease in the traditional medical model, and definitions have not always been clear . OA is a syndrome of joint pain and stiffness with associated functional problems, which can have a substantial effect on quality of life . In terms of structural abnormalities, OA encompasses a number of problems that result in common pathological and radiological features . It is difficult to estimate the true global prevalence of OA as many studies consider only hip and knee OA . The 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated that 242 million people worldwide were affected by symptomatic OA of the hip and/or knee and that the global prevalence of hip and knee OA is approaching 5% . Radiographic OA is more common than symptomatic OA, and detection rates in a given joint may increase when more radiographic views are obtained . However, because ultrasound can visualize the joint in three dimensions, studies using ultrasound have suggested metacarpophalangeal joint OA to be more common than radiographic studies suggest . Effect of age . Individual joints demonstrate a striking age-related rise in the prevalence of radiographic OA . About one-third of all adults have radiographic OA of the hands, with two-thirds over 75 years of age exhibiting OA of the distal interphalangeal joints . Symptomatic OA . Joint pain is common, but not all joint pain is attributable to OA (depending on the definition of OA and extra-articular causes of pain such as tendonitis); indeed, about half of those with radiographic OA report no symptoms . Women report more pain than men: worldwide estimates suggest that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women over 60 years of age have symptomatic OA . African-Americans tend to report greater pain and disability than Caucasians . Many people have multiple joint pains: a study in individuals over the age of 55 suggested a median number of four painful joints (though not all will be OA) . The most common combinations of joint pain are knee and foot pain, knee and back pain, and knee and hand pain . So, while knee pain affects about a quarter of the adult population, the prevalence of a painful disabling knee attributable to OA in the UK population over 55 years of age has been estimated at approximately 10% . Statistics from the USA put the prevalence of a painful OA knee in adults over 45 years of age at 16% . Impact on the individual . OA affects individuals in many complex ways, including . Pain is the commonest reason for patients to present to their family physician; over half of all people with OA say that pain is their worst problem . Often the concepts of pain and stiffness are not clearly distinguished by people with OA . In a detailed survey (the UK OA Nation Report 2012) of 2001 individuals with OA, 79% reported having to give up or reduce activity because of their OA . These problems are much worse when people have multiple joint pain - for example, people with knee pain alone have three times more difficulty in walking than people without knee pain, but the combination of knee, back and foot pain results in 30 times the difficulty . Individuals with OA may report some difficulty with occupational as well as certain leisure activities, depending upon the site and severity of their arthritis . People with OA report poor self-esteem, loss of independence and a considerable effect on close relationships . Between 59% and 87% of adults with OA are estimated to have at least one additional significant chronic condition; indeed, people with OA have an average of 2.6 moderate-to-severe comorbidities . Studies suggest that the presence of such comorbidities magnifies the impact of OA on the individual; conversely, having OA may affect an individual's ability to manage some comorbid conditions . Direct costs . OA made up 22% of these visits, with joint pain contributing a further 36% . The costs to individuals with OA are significant . In 1999/2000, 36 million working days were lost through OA alone, at an estimated cost of £3.2 billion in lost productivity . The strong relationship between OA and age means a frightening rapid rise in OA is likely as the 'baby-boomer' generations grow older . In addition, many Western societies have a substantial and increasing prevalence of obesity, which also increases the OA burden . ","For most people and clinicians, osteoarthritis (OA) refers to a clinical syndrome of joint pain, functional impairment and impaired quality of life. Although radiographic OA is common, it is not always symptomatic. Joint pain is common, increasingly so with age; individuals frequently have multiple joint pains. People with OA are more likely to have comorbid conditions than the general population and comorbidities can exacerbate the impact of OA on an individual. OA has a large impact on the individual and society."
9781908541024,ch_2,"The most fundamental differentiation is between primary intracranial lesions and metastatic tumors . Primary tumors can be further subdivided according to whether they arise from the brain parenchyma, meninges, pituitary region, pineal region or skull base . Neurological symptoms and neuroimaging provide information about tumor location, which is useful in developing a differential diagnosis (Table 1.1) . However, definitive diagnosis of primary brain tumors is based on the cell of origin and requires histopathological assessment . The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system is used widely (see Key references) . Most intracranial tumors arise from the brain parenchyma, primarily from glial cells (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes) . Primary neuronal tumors are uncommon . Meningeal tumors are the second most common type of intracranial tumor . Tumors also arise from a variety of other cell types, including some not ordinarily found in the brain (exempli gratia germ cells, lymphocytes and embryonic rests) (Figure 1.1) . Incidence and epidemiology . Brain metastases are much more common than primary intracranial tumors . Approximately 170000 people in the USA are diagnosed with brain metastases every year, while 62930 are diagnosed with a primary benign or malignant brain tumor . More than 13000 die each year as a result of a primary malignant brain tumor . In children and in men aged 20-39 years, brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the USA . Data from several studies suggest an increase in the incidence of both primary brain tumors, particularly primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, and brain metastases since the 1970s . This may be partly due to a true increase in incidence, but it is also a consequence of greater access to and improvements in neuroimaging techniques . Epidemiological studies of brain tumors are limited as a result of ascertainment bias, small sample size and retrospective design . The best data suggest an annual worldwide incidence for primary brain tumors of 3-4/100000 person-years . The incidence of primary brain tumors varies by sex, race, age and geography . Men have a higher risk than women of developing most brain tumors, with the exception of meningiomas . Similarly, brain tumors are more common in white than other ethnic groups, with the exception of meningiomas and pituitary adenomas . Brain tumors are more common in developed countries . Numerous other risk factors have been reported (Table 1.2) but the studies are generally small and their findings have not been confirmed . An increasing number of molecular genetic alterations have been described in association with particular primary brain tumors (Table 1.3) . For glioblastoma in particular, recent genetic studies have delineated at least three genetically distinct subgroups . In the majority of patients, it is likely that some combination of genetic and environmental factors leads to the development of a brain tumor . Developments in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics are resulting in an exponential increase in our knowledge about all types of brain tumors, and should lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies . ","Primary brain tumors and metastases have been diagnosed with increasing frequency over recent decades. This may reflect a true increase in incidence, but improved neuroimaging techniques and greater access to imaging account for part of this increase. Environmental risk factors for the development of brain tumors are poorly understood and are probably over-reported. Developments in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics are resulting in an exponential increase in our knowledge about all types of brain tumors."
9781908541963,chapter7,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) virus is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide (Table 7.1) . There are an estimated 300 million hepatitis B carriers worldwide and the prevalence of hepatitis B ranges from 0.1 to 20% . The prevalence of hepatitis C also varies geographically and ranges from 0.5 to 15% . Hepatitis is considered chronic when the infection is present for more than 6 months . The prevalence of hepatitis B infection varies worldwide; the highest rates are seen in Asia . Chronic hepatitis B is evaluated on the basis of serological profiles, liver function tests and, in some cases, liver histology . A number of patterns of disease are recognized . persistent replication with evidence of ongoing hepatitis . intermittent flares in viral replication, which may trigger episodes of hepatitis . Serological assessment of chronic hepatitis B can appear complex (Table 7.2) . HBsAg is present in all cases of chronic infection . Pre-core mutants of the HBV do not express HBeAg, and infected individuals may not have HBeAb unless they were previously infected with the wild-type virus . In these cases, the viral replication status can only be determined by HBV DNA assay . Seroconversion from HBeAg to HBeAb may cause hepatitis-like symptoms; patients come to clinical attention during this process . Chronic hepatitis develops in 90% of infants and in 5% of adults acquiring the infection . The spectrum of liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis B includes . Many patients with chronic hepatitis do not develop significant liver disease during their lifetime . Once cirrhosis develops, 85% of patients remain stable for a further 5 years, but the risk of developing symptoms of liver failure increases significantly thereafter . The risk of developing HCC once cirrhosis has developed is 1-2% per year . Interferon clears the virus in about 40% of cases by increasing immune responsiveness to the virus . The overall burden of hepatitis B on transplant resources is therefore decreasing . In the absence of reinfection, the results of liver transplantation for hepatitis B are comparable to those for other patient subgroups . Hepatitis D (delta) virus is an incomplete virus that can exist only in association with hepatitis B infection . It can be acquired with hepatitis B or can be superimposed on established disease . The incidence of hepatitis D appears to be decreasing . Hepatitis C virus is an RNA virus . Intravenous drug use was associated with an infection rate of approximately 70%, and tattooing has resulted in infection with hepatitis C in up to 30% of cases . The prevalence of hepatitis C varies geographically and ranges from 0.5-1% in most Western countries to over 15% in parts of Africa . Serological assessment of hepatitis C includes . Once HCV antibodies have been detected, the patient should be screened for HCV RNA . The genotype is relevant when assessing the likely response to therapy and in determining the duration of therapy . Hepatitis C is also associated with a phenomenon called quasi-species, which denotes the presence of many strains of the virus within an individual patient . The acute infection is rarely clinically identified and, in most cases, the likely timing of infection can only be determined from an assessment of the risk factors for acquisition of the virus . About 85% of those infected become chronic carriers . Infected individuals express a range of liver disease, ranging from mild hepatitis to cirrhosis . Alcohol consumption accelerates progression to cirrhosis by up to 10 years . Patients over 40 years of age also have more aggressive disease . Once cirrhosis develops, the superimposed risk of developing HCC is in the order of 1-2% per patient-year . Liver transplantation . Liver disease associated with hepatitis C is now the most common indication for liver transplantation in most countries . Unlike hepatitis B, the burden of hepatitis C on transplant resources is increasing and is not expected to peak for another 10-15 years . The indications for liver transplantation are the same as for hepatitis B . Nevertheless, a proportion of patients who are HCV RNA negative at the time of transplantation following antiviral therapy do not develop recurrent infection . As a result, the survival rate for hepatitis C was lower than for other indications 8 years and more after liver transplantation . ","Hepatitis B and C virus are the most common causes of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination and is treatable in 40-60% of cases. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it is treatable in up to 85% of cases with interferon-based regimens or the new oral therapy sofosbuvir. Liver transplantation may be required for end-stage chronic liver disease and small hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C almost invariably recurred after liver transplantation and was problematic, but the availability of additional therapeutic options is likely to change this."
9781908541086,ch_9,"Recent studies on the treatment of bulimia have demonstrated that, for adults, cognitive interventions and antidepressants, especially selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are effective . For the younger patients, family therapy may be indicated; ultimately, data indicate that intensive treatment modalities play an important role in any attempt at recovery . The primary goals of treatment for bulimia are . to help a patient stop bingeing and purging . to help a patient learn, regain and maintain healthy eating patterns . to address other psychological issues related to the primary diagnosis of bulimia . Non-pharmacological treatment . The most commonly used treatments for patients with bulimia are psychological and patient-led interventions . behavioral techniques . family and marital therapy . group therapy . support groups/stepped programs . Cognitive-behavior therapy comprises four distinct phases for patients with bulimia . The patient is also asked to self-monitor nutritional intake, and bingeing and purging behaviors . The patient is then educated about healthy regular eating patterns and is encouraged to resume or engage in nutritious eating . Therapy is slowly tapered when the patient shows consolidated signs of progress . Patients are made to eat foods that they fear either gradually or through a binge and are then prevented from purging . Concomitantly, the patient also becomes less fearful of normal eating . Patients with bulimia benefit from learning alternative means of dealing with negative emotions such as anxiety . Family and marital therapy . Patients whose family and marital dynamics contribute to, or exacerbate, bulimic symptoms may benefit from family or marital therapy . Two studies of the family environments of patients with bulimia showed that punishment contributed to overall outcome difficulties and was indicative of poor family functioning . There have been promising results in studies of adolescents with bulimia who still live with their parents . For example, a pilot study found that treatment of female patients (aged 14-17 years) with brief family therapy resulted in significant decreases in bulimic behavior at 1 year . This type of therapy has also produced good results in older patients with marital discord or ongoing conflicts with parents . However, it is generally less effective than in patients with anorexia . Group therapy . Patients who demonstrate particularly poor social skills and who appear particularly susceptible to group or societal pressures toward thinness may benefit from group therapy targeted at bulimia recovery . Support groups/stepped programs . Some patients have found groups and programs such as Overeaters Anonymous to be helpful, in conjunction with initial treatments, for the prevention of relapses . These programs, however, should not be used as the primary treatment for bulimia . Further development of such programs may prove to be important in providing treatment to patients who otherwise would not have access to adequate care . Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) . Pharmacological treatment . Antidepressants have been used in the treatment of bulimia with encouraging results, and about 30% of patients benefit from pharmacotherapy alone . In general, higher doses of SSRIs are used for the treatment of bulimia than for depression, with careful monitoring of side effects . Care must be taken in patients with . A withdrawal syndrome is seen in up to 60% of patients in whom an SSRI other than fluoxetine is stopped suddenly . Other common side effects of SSRIs include . Although there had been initial evidence supporting the efficacy of imipramine and desipramine for bulimia, these are now considered to be an outdated treatment for bulimia . Other medications . Numerous other agents have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of bulimia in double-blind placebo-controlled studies . Monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine have been used for the treatment of bulimia . However, MAOIs are potentially dangerous to patients with chaotic bingeing and purging, so they should be administered cautiously . Optimizing treatment . Up to 70% of patients with bulimia benefit from a combination of medication and cognitive-behavior interventions . Some patients find support groups helpful . Treatment of bulimia . Studies of treatment options for bulimia are more advanced than those for anorexia . For patients suffering from bulimia, the most common modes of treatment involve psychological therapy, medication or a combination of both . ","The main goals of treatment for bulimia are abstinence from bingeing and purging, learning and maintaining healthy eating behaviors, and addressing any other psychological issues related to the condition. Psychological interventions are the mainstay of treatment; symptoms of bingeing and purging and other aspects of eating disorders respond better to psychotherapy than to medication alone. Up to 70% of patients benefit from a combination of cognitive-behavior techniques and pharmacotherapy. Higher doses of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are used for the treatment of bulimia than for depression, with careful monitoring of side effects. Fluoxetine is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bulimia; it is also licensed for this use in the UK. Regular moderate exercise may help patients to deal with the weight fluctuations that can be expected while their bodies adjust to new healthy eating patterns."
9781912776726,ch5,"The treatment of glioblastoma includes recognizing and managing a host of disease- and treatment-related complications . This chapter focuses on several of the most common conditions associated with glioblastoma . More than half of patients with cancer who experience fatigue never tell their doctor about it, but as it is one of the most common symptoms experienced by patients with glioblastoma it is important to ascertain whether it is a problem . It may help if the patient keeps a 'fatigue diary', including a note of activities that make the fatigue better or worse . If the patient is fit enough, then a light to moderate level of exercise or physical therapy should be encouraged . Steroids can be prescribed, but patients should be made aware of the likely short-term adverse events, including raised glucose, thin skin, easy bruising, gastric irritation and the increased risk of infection . A systematic review of 42 observational studies involving 4089 patients with primary cerebral glioma (varying stages) reported a median frequency of depression at clinical interview of 15% (range 6-28%) . The risk of depression was not affected by sex or older age, or with tumor location, histology, grade or extent of resection . The authors considered depression to be primarily a psychological response to the loss of health . The authors recommended the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) as an accurate initial screening instrument for depression in glioma, although it may be difficult to apply in patients with hemiparesis, hemianopia, hemisensory neglect or dysphagia; all these conditions might skew the answers . A retrospective study reported that almost 22% of 160 patients with glioblastoma took a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor during treatment for glioblastoma without affecting the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy or compromising survival . Localization of high-grade gliomas to the temporal lobe or cortex may also cause seizures . Surgical resection may induce seizures if, for example, the tumor is localized to the temporal lobe . Conversely, resection may reduce the incidence of seizures if they are being caused by edema or the mass effect of the tumor . In a retrospective analysis of 103 patients with glioblastoma, 22% (all with IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastoma) experienced seizures . Patients with seizures had smaller tumors, which caused less edema than non-epileptogenic tumors . The authors concluded that epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic tumors were morphologically different . Antiepileptic drugs are recommended for patients who present with seizures, but prophylactic use outside the perioperative phase is not advised . Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with intrinsic brain tumors, with an annual incidence of up to 20% . Risk factors include glioblastoma molecular subtype (exempli gratia patients with IDH1 -mutant glioblastoma have a lower incidence of VTE than those with an IDH wild-type tumor), paresis, neurological deficits, immobilization, surgery and steroid use . The risk of VTE is increased by a tumor-induced hypercoagulable state . As there is no evidence that anticoagulation therapy prevents VTE in these patients, prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended, but vigilance for suspicious indicatory symptoms is required . Glioma is not a contraindication to standard anticoagulation in patients with established thrombosis . Steroids can be used to decrease tumor-associated edema and improve clinical symptoms . Physicians should make a clinical decision on the optimal starting dose of steroids after assessing the patient . Steroids are not indicated in the absence of edema-associated neurological deficits or if intracranial pressure is normal . Prolonged steroid use after resection is not recommended, and prophylaxis with steroids is not required during radiotherapy in asymptomatic patients . Prolonged exposure to steroids is not advised because of the potential for side effects . The dose of steroids should be tapered and discontinued where clinically appropriate . Monitoring of blood glucose during steroid therapy is advocated, given that in a retrospective study of 393 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide, a time-weighted mean glucose of 6.3 mmol/L was independently associated with longer overall survival (p > 0.005) . ","Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in patients with glioblastoma. If the patient is fit enough, then light-to-moderate exercise or physical therapy should be encouraged. Short-term steroids may be useful, provided patients are warned of the potential short-term adverse effects. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are suitable treatment for patients with depression during glioblastoma treatment. These drugs do not appear to affect the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy or compromise survival. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) can be used for the assessment of depression in patients with glioblastoma with the caveat that results may be skewed in patients with hemiparesis, hemianopia, hemisensory neglect or dysphagia. Although seizures are a common symptom in patients with glioblastoma, prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs outside the perioperative phase is not advised. First-generation antiepileptic drugs may interact with other medications; the preferred antiepileptic agents are lamotrigine, levetiracetam, pregabalin and valproic acid. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with intrinsic brain tumors. Glioma is not a contraindication to standard anticoagulation in patients with established thrombosis, but prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended. Instead, clinicians and patients need to be vigilant for any signs or symptoms of VTE. Steroid treatment (usually dexamethasone, 8-16 mg per day) will decrease tumor-associated edema and improve symptoms. Lower doses may be equally effective."
9781912776139,ch4,"The average time from symptom onset to firm diagnosis of ALS is around 1 year in both UK and US clinics . failure to recognize initial symptoms . failure to recognize the progression of symptoms . Symptom onset in ALS is generally accepted as being the first sign of muscle weakness . Interval from symptom onset to diagnosis as a prognostic marker . It is the slowly progressive forms of ALS that are usually the most challenging diagnostically . Fasciculation or cramps without weakness . Although fasciculation is an important clinical sign of ALS in someone presenting with progressive weakness, it is rarely reported in isolation by those with ALS before the formal diagnosis . ALS should not be diagnosed in the absence of demonstrable weakness, but the individual should have regular clinical examinations over several months (sometimes up to 3 years) . Lower motor neuron-predominant syndromes . An estimated 20% of ALS cases lack detectable clinical UMN involvement . Symmetric upper-limb syndromes . Such cases typically arrest spontaneously after several years without further progression beyond the upper limbs, but it is not clear whether surgical intervention is associated with recovery . Symmetric lower-limb syndromes . A family history of the disorder is unreliable, but the dHMNs are typically very slowly progressive disorders and distinguished from ALS by the lack of bulbar or respiratory involvement . It only affects males, and it is much rarer than ALS . It is a slowly progressive symmetric LMN disorder, with symptom onset in the fourth or fifth decade . The age at symptom onset of this largely sporadic disorder is typically over 50 years with a 3:1 male predominance . Progression is slower than in ALS . Monomelic syndromes . It is much rarer than LMN-predominant forms of ALS . The mean age of onset is significantly younger than ALS (40 versus 65 years) with a male predominance of 3:1 . This approach often delays optimal care of far more common cases of ALS when it is applied erroneously . The syndrome is typically unilateral but bilateral in 10% of cases, and mostly affects the brachial plexus . This painful onset typically distinguishes neuralgic amyotrophy from the painless weakness of ALS . As with neuralgic amyotrophy, the painful onset typically distinguishes this condition from the painless weakness of ALS . In approximately 20% of cases, the opposite arm may have milder involvement . Fasciculation is not prominent . Post-radiotherapy plexopathy syndrome . It is usually slowly progressive, with significant disability and sphincter involvement . Post-polio syndrome . Acute poliomyelitis may be associated with a non-progressive, typically unilateral, wasting of the distal limb with associated weakness . Upper motor neuron-predominant syndromes . Most UMN-only cases of progressive weakness will evolve into UMN-predominant ALS, which has a significantly slower-than-average rate of progression . A small proportion of cases have corticobulbar onset to symptoms . Mills' hemiparesis syndrome . Clinical signs are usually bilateral . Some cases of ALS overlap with Parkinsonism . Mild corticobasal syndromes are also recognized in some cases of ALS, particularly those associated with the C9orf72 expansion . There are often sensory symptoms and evidence of demyelination on MRI . Positive CSF oligoclonal bands are not specific and may be occasionally seen in cases of ALS . Typically, however, there are sensory symptoms with prominent proprioceptive deficits . Brainstem-predominant syndromes . ALS cases invariably experience a degree of dysarthria before significant dysphagia develops . Muscle biopsy is typically definitive . Onset is usually in the sixth or seventh decade of life . Riboflavin transporter syndromes . BVVL progresses to involve respiratory and limb weakness . Retroviral syndromes . A rare progressive distal LMN syndrome is recognized in the context of HIV infection, but typically has prominent sensory symptoms . A progressive UMN syndrome associated with anti-amphiphysin antibodies has also been documented (typically in breast cancer) . They do not resemble the clinical course of ALS . ","There is a significant multifactorial delay in the presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to the neurologist, at which point the diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds alone. There are very few credible ALS mimic disorders (and even fewer that are reversible). The ALS spectrum comprises lower motor neuron-predominant, upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant and symmetric limb syndromes. Fasciculation as a primary symptom and without associated weakness is nearly always benign. Incidental spinal spondylosis is common among those with ALS and, if not carefully considered, it may lead to diagnostic delay and inappropriate surgical intervention. Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block is much rarer than ALS and has a younger age of onset, most commonly manifesting as unilateral 'finger drop'. Primary lateral sclerosis is very rare, has a younger age of onset and has at least 4 years before it can be differentiated confidently from UMN-predominant forms of ALS, which progress more slowly. ALS is the most common cause of progressive dysarthria followed by dysphagia."
9781910797211,ch06,"A multidisciplinary approach is an absolute requirement for optimal care of the parkinsonian patient . Many patients find the support offered by organizations such as Parkinson's UK helpful (see Useful resources, (pages 161 -) . A Parkinson's disease nurse specialist (PDNS) can spend more time with the patient and can offer telephone support . Some patients may need specialist counseling to help them to come to terms with the diagnosis . Parkinson's disease nurse specialist . The PDNS is skilled in patient and carer assessment, differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and appropriate drug treatment, medicines management and communication . The role of the PDNS in the care of patients with Parkinson's disease has been reported in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), although the methods used in these studies have varied widely . The studies reported that PDNS care allowed a swift implementation of good clinical practice for Parkinson's disease, including home visits, and a high rate of patient satisfaction . Ongoing support . In the early stages, the main focus is often on drug therapy . Despite this, some patients will need a wheelchair outside the home . Other studies have addressed small numbers of patients only; for example, one randomized trial evaluated 8 patients in a 16-week aerobic exercise program . In another, 88 patients were randomized to the Alexander technique, massage or a control group . Significant improvements were reported in outcome measures in treated patients versus controls at 6 months . Home exercise programs are popular with patients with Parkinson's disease as they can be tailored to their individual needs and practiced within the safety and comfort of their own home . The evidence base of efficacy for speech and language therapy (SALT) is limited by the small numbers of patients included in trials: three RCTs have evaluated a total sample of 63 patients . Adaptation of the home is often necessary when the patient becomes more disabled . Occupational therapists assess the safety of homes, particularly when the patient is prone to falling . In the past, there has been little evidence to support the use of interventional occupational therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease; however, new studies have shown efficacy . Often the brunt of care falls on a patient's spouse or partner . Additional help may be needed to assist the patient with dressing, toileting or bathing . Consultations with the patient should include the carer, with attention given to the carer's mental and physical health and to whether additional support is needed . Patients who hallucinate or have dementia often provoke social crises and cries for help from carers . These are the most difficult problems for patients with Parkinson's disease and their carers, and occur in at least 30% of cases . The PDNS can advise nursing homes on effective management of patients with Parkinson's disease who have dementia, and the importance of regulating their medication . Demented patients who are prone to wander may need a locked facility . Advice from a dietitian may be needed if a patient's nutritional intake is thought to be poor . An early warning sign is when the patient does not finish meals . A double-blind placebo-controlled trial reported good efficacy for Movicol in the treatment of constipation in patients with Parkinson's disease . Patients often ask how food interferes with drug treatment . Even without drug treatment patients often feel worse in the afternoon, which may be due, in part, to a fall in blood pressure after a large meal at lunchtime . In elderly men, symptoms are often a result of both Parkinson's disease and prostatic hypertrophy . Skin care . Although skin problems related to parkinsonism are common, patients rarely complain about them . Sexual problems are not uncommon and are usually the concern of male patients; these issues need to be addressed with the patient as they are often important in terms of overall quality of life . The need for palliative care in Parkinson's disease indicates a stage when drugs are no longer well tolerated, the patient is an unsuitable candidate for surgery and there is considerable comorbidity . The burden of both motor and non-motor symptoms is high in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease, such that patients may require specialist palliative care services to improve quality of life . 'End of Life' initiatives such as the one set up by the UK Department of Health train health professionals in the palliative needs and care of patients . Alternatively, power of attorney enables a spouse, parent or sibling to make decisions regarding care once the patient is no longer able to . ","Early in the course of the disease, patients most need clear information, advice and counseling. Multidisciplinary therapy and input from a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist (PDNS) should be available to all patients at all stages of the disease. The PDNS is ideally placed to recognize when palliative care is needed, and to initiate and support the appropriate care. Physiotherapy is particularly useful at a stage when balance problems become obvious. In early Parkinson's disease, patients should be encouraged to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables to stimulate a sluggish bowel. Although a large protein intake may compete with levodopa absorption, patients should not restrict their total protein intake. Hallucinations often presage cognitive decline with memory difficulties and disorientation, the most difficult problems for both patients and carers; drugs that are most likely to cause hallucinosis should be withdrawn immediately. Bladder symptoms, sleep problems and sexual problems are common, and need to be addressed. Skin problems are common, but patients rarely complain of them; drug rashes may necessitate withdrawal of the offending agent. Patients and carers should be given the chance to discuss end-of-life issues at the appropriate time with suitably trained professionals."
9781910797471,ch08,"Approximately 10% of patients who have an ICD for primary prevention receive an appropriate shock in the first 2 years after the device is implanted . The battery life of a modern device is about 5-10 years . Not infrequently, the significant reversal of LV remodeling may obviate the need for device therapy . (In patients with permanent atrial fibrillation there is no requirement for an atrial lead . Types of device . A device may be either a pacemaker (CRT-P) or a pacemaker and defibrillator (CRT-D), but there is some controversy about which device is best . There is therefore an argument to implant a CRT-D in patients with fewer symptoms and a CRT-P in those with advanced HF . As a result, CRT is now standard therapy for patients with HF, broad QRS complexes and symptoms despite optimal medical treatment (Table 8.2) . There is also some evidence that CRT slows down the progression of HF . Does everyone benefit? Virtually all studies have shown that 20-30% of patients fail to demonstrate a positive outcome ('non-responders') . As these devices are expensive, identifying patients who may not benefit is critically important . Cost-effectiveness for ICDs is significantly reduced in patients over 75-80 years old (Figure 8.6), and clinical judgment should be used in very elderly patients . Increasingly, CRT is used earlier in treatment . Although non-responders are a significant issue, some patients respond very significantly ('super-responders') . Identifying these patients has also been a challenge . Often the only way to know for sure whether the patient will respond is to implant the device . Not all patients respond positively to CRT; across the major trials a consistent 20-40% of patients are deemed non-responders . Maximizing the hemodynamic benefit of CRT for patients in sinus rhythm has been shown to improve outcome . Future developments will allow the device to transmit data directly to an implanted CRT device . Specific risks relating to CRT include . failure to implant the left ventricular leads (< 5%) . late lead displacement (8%) . Cardiac contractility modulation via a pacemaker-like device is a relatively new development for the treatment of HF . These patients are not eligible for CRT and therefore represent an additional group who do not respond to medical therapy alone . Cardiac surgery . The STICH trial compared routine bypass surgery in patients with impaired LV function with an additional procedure to reduce LV volume in patients with large anterior wall scars . Available LV assist devices include . total artificial heart . The devices can deliver cardiac output of up to 10 L/minute . The effect of LV assist devices on LV function has been extensively studied . The REMATCH trial compared the long-term effect of LV assist devices with medical therapy . The results supported the use of the devices for patients with advanced HF, but at the cost of device-related complications, including . 28% device infection rate after 3 months . Patient selection . There are three groups of patients who should be considered for LV assist devices . Patients who are not expected to recover adequate cardiac function and who require mechanical support as a bridge to transplantation . Patients who require permanent LV support and are not eligible for cardiac transplantation (destination therapy) . The total artificial heart is a mechanical device that entirely replaces the heart's function . A number of versions of the device have been made since . Studies show that up to 80% of patients survive to transplant . The device is powered by a large console that limits the patient's movement . Portable drivers that will enable patients to return home are in the testing phase . Over 1500 such devices have been implanted worldwide, although there are still significant technical and patient-related challenges; a fully functioning chronically implanted device is still some years away . Infection is common (up to 20% of cases are device related) but treatable and does not necessarily mandate device removal . Cardiac transplantation outcomes have been steadily improving over the last 30 years . Patient selection . Patients who are considered for transplantation have to undergo a battery of tests . Eligible patients are placed on the waiting lists . Improved preoperative care has meant that the death rate for patients awaiting cardiac transplantation has declined considerably . ","Patients with poor left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction < 35%), who are symptomatic on optimal medical treatment, with broad QRS complexes (> 120 ms) and left bundle branch block should be referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy. With evolving technology, the complication rate of left ventricle assist devices and total artificial hearts will decline and their use will significantly increase as a bridge to transplantation and as destination therapy. Assuming that the candidate pool (patients with end-stage heart failure [HF]) continues to grow, the burden on healthcare systems worldwide could become significant. Cardiac transplantation remains a viable option in selected individuals with end-stage HF despite the shortage of donor organs; steady improvement in survival after cardiac transplantation has been observed."
9781912776238,ch2,"A biosimilar, as its name suggests, is highly similar to the reference biological product (see below), but it is not identical . Differences in formulation, presentation and the administration device are permitted, provided that these differences do not affect safety or effectiveness . The rationale for biosimilars is economic; the transition from small molecule drugs to biologics has markedly increased drug expenditure, although this has been accompanied by improved outcomes . The high prices of biologics are justified by manufacturers on the basis of the investment in discovery, development and production . An opportunity to reduce costs . While discussion of costs may make some clinicians uncomfortable, attention to the health budget is a reality of modern medicine . Given aging populations and the rising prevalence of chronic conditions and cancers for which biologics are used, biologics represent a major demand on healthcare budgets that are already under pressure, and rationing measures are inevitably applied . However, just as the introduction of generic versions following patent expiry of small molecule drugs drove down prices, biosimilars can be expected to lower the prices of biologics . The substantial savings realized can improve patient access by allowing more patients to be treated from the same budget . Thus, biosimilars will enable stakeholders - including payers, clinicians and patients - to benefit from greater choice of treatment options, and more patients will have access to these treatments (Figure 2.1) . The potential to reduce medicine costs today is significant; of the 12 bestselling global medicines of 2018, nine were biologics and six of those with total sales of US$54 billion face biosimilar competition now or in the near future (Table 2.2) . If biosimilars of those six could be sold at 50% discount, savings would deliver US$28 billion a year to reinvest into global healthcare . Additional savings can be predicted - over the next 7 years a further 35 biologics face loss of patent and potential biosimilar competition . The 2018 European Commission meeting on biosimilars provided an opportunity to assess biosimilar impact after a decade of use . The first conclusion from the meeting was that lack of price transparency made data-driven economic assessments - such as those made by IQVIA (formerly Quintiles and IMS Health) - difficult . Using list prices, savings from biosimilars were moderate, with price reductions of 20-40% compared with the reference medicine price prior to biosimilars . However, the potential savings associated with biosimilars under this level of discount are illustrated in Figure 2.2 . Opening markets to biosimilar competition could enable healthcare systems to realize savings of more than €10 billion in the EU's five major markets (EU M5; UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy) between 2016 and 2020 - based solely on direct competition for the originator molecule; further savings are possible through indirect competition for other in-class or therapy-area-specific product sales . Biosimilars deliver biological drugs at lower costs than originators because the processes supporting drug discovery and the identification of effective indications, doses and schedules have already been funded by the original reference medicine developer . Furthermore, as the market for the drug has already been created, promotion and marketing expenses should also be significantly reduced . Economics also sets the agenda for the evidence needed to use biosimilars in practice; while biosimilars must be clinically similar, they have no utility to health systems unless they can be economically different . The key driver of price reductions is competition between brands, with more brands marketed creating greater competition and thus discounts . To maximize price-volume discounts, pharmacy formulary managers will want to stock, ideally, only one preferred brand of each biologic; this mandates the use of biosimilars in extrapolated indications . Also, to maximize discounts over time, repeat tender process cycles will be needed - mandating that biologics and biosimilars can be switched between different brands as part of the typical 1-2-year competitive drug tender purchase cycle without excess risk to patients . Note that prescribing of biosimilars is entirely in keeping with the concept of rational prescribing, as defined by WHO: Medicine use is rational (appropriate, proper, correct) when patients receive the appropriate medicines, in doses that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost both to them and the community . To ensure effective uptake of biosimilars, clinicians and other healthcare professionals should be informed of the benefits and safety of biosimilars . Persisting concerns can also be addressed - there have been no efficacy or safety concerns during the first decade of biosimilar use in Europe . ","Biologics have provided major advances in treatment of many chronic diseases but are a burden on health budgets that is predicted to increase with changing demographics. Biosimilars provide a lower-cost option to replace original-brand products. In the era of biosimilars, payers, clinicians and patients can benefit from a greater choice of biologics and, through price reductions, access to these treatments can increase. Prescribing a biosimilar is in keeping with the concept of rational prescribing, which includes a cost imperative."

Neutrophils in turn release cytokines that trigger the recruitment of further immune cells . Cytokine release from immune cells leads to the characteristic signs of inflammation . activation of cell growth patterns leading to high-grade malignancy . cellular (or cell-mediated) immunity is mediated by T cells originating in the thymus . humoral immunity is mediated by B cells derived from bone marrow . In both cases, immune cells are activated following exposure to antigens such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids or nucleic acids, leading to an immune response directed against specific antigens . A key step in adaptive immunity is the presentation of antigens to immune cells . MHC class I molecules are present on all nucleated cells and platelets, and serve to trigger a cytotoxic T-cell response to the infected cell . Cellular immunity . Surface T cell receptors (TCRs) are specific to individual antigens, and are activated when the TCR binds to the appropriate antigen . The availability of T cells to respond to the wide variety of potential antigens is achieved through extensive random rearrangements in the TCR gene during T-cell development in the thymus . T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of APCs in association with MHC molecules . Activation of T h cells, which requires a weaker stimulus than for cytotoxic T cells, leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells including APCs . There are two types of CD4+ T cell responses . CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (also known as killer T cells) are activated by antigens from intracellular pathogens presented on MHC class I molecules . These cells recognize cells with a unique MHC class I-antigen complex, and release enzymes and toxins that lyse the cell membrane and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis) . To prevent extensive tissue damage during an infection, activation of CD8+ cells requires three signals (Figure 1.4) . binding of the MHC class I or II molecules to accessory CD8 or CD4 molecules, respectively, on the T cell . Humoral immunity involves the production in B cells of antibodies (immunoglobulins) against specific antigens . In contrast to T cells, where the antigen is processed intracellularly before being expressed on the cell surface in association with MHC molecules, B cells recognize the native, unprocessed, form of the antigen . The B cell receptor (BCR) consists of an antibody that recognizes a specific antigen . Upon activation by binding of the antigen to the BCR, B cells differentiate into short-lived antibody-producing cells (plasma cells) (Figure 1.5) . Once the antigen has been cleared, the plasma cells are eliminated via programmed cell death (apoptosis) . However, approximately 10% of activated B cells differentiate into long-lived antigen-specific memory B cells (see Figure 1.5); this allows a rapid immune response to be mounted in the event of re-exposure to the antigen . Full activation and differentiation of B cells requires an additional co-stimulatory signal, from either T h cells or T cell-independent mechanisms such as toll-like receptor ligands (a group of proteins that play important roles in antigen recognition by the innate immune system) . One well-characterized function of NK cells is antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) . Development of immune tolerance . A number of mechanisms contribute to peripheral tolerance, primarily involving regulation of T-cell populations, particularly CD4+ T h cells . Following repeated exposure to antigens, naive CD4+ T h cells differentiate into induced T reg cells, a process mediated by IL-12 production following T-cell activation, and by TGF-beta secreted by APCs . Peripheral tolerance may also be mediated by other T-cell populations resembling T reg cells, such as TR1 cells that express IL-10, and TH3 cells that secrete TGF-beta . In addition to these T-cell mechanisms, peripheral tolerance may result from expression in B cells of CD22, a non-specific receptor inhibitor that decreases activation of BCRs, and by production of IL-10 and TGF-beta in B cells . ","The immune system has two components: innate immunity, involving mechanisms present throughout life, and adaptive (acquired) immunity, which is conferred by immune responses following exposure to an antigen, and is specific to that antigen. Innate immunity is primarily conferred by phagocytic cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow, principally macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils. There are two forms of adaptive immunity: cellular immunity mediated by T cells originating in the thymus, and humoral immunity mediated by B cells originating in the bone marrow. In cellular immunity, T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.- Activation of CD4+ T cells leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells, including APCs.- Activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells triggers clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells, which release enzymes and toxins that lyse the membrane of antigen-bearing cells and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). Humoral immunity involves the production by B cells of antibodies against specific antigens. Immune tolerance is a state in which the immune system is unresponsive to a stimulus that would normally provoke an immune response. This may be central or peripheral, depending on where tolerance develops. Immune tolerance is an important mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system."
