Radiotherapy has a role in the management of most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . Overall, treatment options vary according to the stage of the tumor (see Chapter 3) but also depend on the individual patient's lung function, volume of disease and performance status . Patient selection . Patients with interstitial lung disease are rarely suitable . Patients with poor lung function may still be eligible provided they have been adequately counseled about the long-term risks of breathlessness . Radical radiotherapy delivery . All patients eligible for radiotherapy should first undergo a planning CT scan in the treatment position . As the tumor can move, respiratory motion management is mandatory when planning and treating the patient . The planned target volume then accounts for any tumor excursion . Conventionally, fractionated radiotherapy is administered, usually with a daily dose of approximately 2 Gy . Hyperfractionation is radiotherapy delivered at less than 2 Gy per fraction but more than once a day so that the treatment time remains the same but total dose is increased . Hypofractionated radiotherapy refers to dose fractions greater than 2 Gy and allows acceleration of treatment . Hypo- or hyperfractionated treatment have the potential for increased late toxicity . The principal schedules are . conventional fractionation: 64-66 Gy in 32-33 daily fractions over 6.5 weeks . accelerated hypofractionation: 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks . continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART): 54 Gy in 36 fractions over 12 consecutive days . Conventional fractionation and accelerated hypofractionation are thought to be equivalent, but hypofractionation involves fewer visits, is more convenient for patients and requires fewer resources . Observational data suggest that radiotherapy is inferior to contemporary surgical series, which have reported 5-year survival of 80% for stage Ia and 60% for stage Ib . Reports from cohorts who received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy indicate dismal 5-year survivals of 32% for stage I and 21% for stage II patients . In one series, this translated into a 7-month median survival advantage (21 vs 14 months) over no treatment in stage I patients and a 5-month survival advantage (14 vs 9 months) in stage II patients . CHART shortens the overall treatment time but delivers three treatment fractions per day . Compared with conventional fractionation at a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, it has demonstrated superior local control (23% vs 16%) and 5-year overall survival (30% vs 21%) . Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or stereotactic ablative radiotherapy is the delivery of an extremely high dose of radiotherapy to a small target using hypofractionation . The fraction sizes are typically greater than 8 Gy per fraction . It is used for the treatment of stage I disease, and more recently for the treatment of oligometastatic disease . Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) refers to the use of imaging to reduce the uncertainty of tumor position during treatment . It has been estimated that a dose greater than 84 Gy is needed to provide 50% tumor control at 3 years . A meta-analysis in stage I patients has confirmed equivalent survival to surgery at 2 years . Local failures occur in less than 10% of patients but these failure rates can increase as tumor volume increases, with T2 disease or as the dose falls . Radical radiotherapy with chemotherapy . Sequential chemoradiation (chemotherapy before radiotherapy), or occasionally radiotherapy alone, is recommended for patients with a relatively large tumor volume or for patients not fit enough to receive concurrent chemoradiation . The CHART regimen of hyperfractionated accelerated treatment has shown a survival benefit over standard radical radiotherapy delivery . The SOCCAR trial (55 Gy in 20 fractions) demonstrated that hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy can be given safely with concurrent chemotherapy . An update in 2005 found no adverse effect in pN2 disease . Radiotherapy provides effective palliation of symptomatic advanced intrathoracic disease and metastases . Patients with advanced disease who received a schedule of 39 Gy in 13 fractions showed a 2-month survival advantage over 17 Gy in 2 fractions (7 vs 9 months); however, two of the patients in the 39 Gy group and one in the 17 Gy group exhibited radiation myelopathy . In practice, 20 Gy in 5 fractions is frequently used in patients with performance status 2/3 . 
What is addiction? . There are almost certainly several mechanisms underlying smoking addiction, all involving nicotine in some way . Thus, smokers experience urges to smoke when confronted with smoking cues, but these need not stem from any anticipated pleasure from smoking or conscious decision-making process . At higher levels it is persistent and insistent, trying in some sense to motivate the smoker to do something to relieve it . It is a need . Thus, nicotine does not alleviate these problems in people who do not smoke . This means that smokers learn to associate adverse mood states and difficulty concentrating with smoking, and come to believe that smoking helps them to cope, even though it does so only because they are experiencing the problem because they have not smoked for a while . Unfortunately, as long as they believe that smoking helps to relieve adverse mood and other symptoms, smokers will be at risk of relapse when they try to stop . The sum of motivations . Different smokers probably experience each of these three elements of nicotine dependence to differing degrees . Thus, some smokers clearly have a strong nicotine hunger and smoke as soon as they wake up in the morning and whenever the opportunity arises during the day . For some smokers the nicotine withdrawal syndrome is relatively mild, while others experience severe adverse mood states when not smoking . Of course, there is more to smoking than this: enjoyment of smoking, social rewards and attachment to the 'smoker identity' all play some role (Figure 5.2) . Recognizing an addicted smoker . Most smokers encountered by clinicians can be assumed to be addicted to some degree . Addicted smokers can be recognized or diagnosed in several ways . A simple indicator of dependence is smoking soon after waking . Natural history of quitting . Research shows, however, that smokers who smoke at all, even a puff, are extremely likely to relapse completely . This makes it imperative that smokers avoid any smoking, no matter how minor . These initial smoking episodes tend to happen - somewhat predictably - in circumstances in which the smoker is exposed to cues that elicit craving . Lapses are more likely when the smoker has been drinking, because smoking is associated with drinking and possibly because alcohol intoxication may undermine resolve . Exposure to other smokers or other smoking cues . The sight and smell of smoking naturally prompts craving, and proximity to smokers means cigarettes are readily available . Furthermore, behavioral studies have shown that smokers in the grip of a cue-elicited craving engage in distorted thinking, overestimating the positive effects of smoking, which predisposes them to smoke . It is therefore vital that smokers who are planning to quit anticipate these challenges and prepare coping strategies to deal with them . An unsuccessful attempt to quit does not doom a smoker to repeated failure . Smokers who have tried and failed should try again, ideally after learning from their past failures by analyzing what went wrong . Most smokers are unhappy about their smoking and want to stop; in the USA and the UK, about 40% report having tried to stop in the past year . Contrary to what is popularly believed, younger smokers are more motivated to stop and try to stop more often than older smokers . This may be because as smokers get older, it is the hard core who are least motivated to stop who remain as smokers . It could also be the case that experience of repeated failure at stopping over the decades reduces smokers' motivation to stop . Perhaps surprisingly, these seem less likely to succeed than when smokers take the plunge and stop in one go . The phase leading up to the quit attempt is one in which a smoker struggles with the conflict between the knowledge of the harm that smoking does and continuing to smoke . A smoker experiences episodes of discomfort about his or her smoking when prompted to think about its harmful effects, excessive cost and feelings of stigma and so forth . At any one moment, the balance between the forces motivating restraint and the motivations to smoke determines whether the would-be ex-smoker accepts the offer of a cigarette, goes out and buys a packet of cigarettes or engages in some other activity that leads to smoking . When faced with a temptation to smoke, and if equipped with adequate motivation to avoid smoking, smokers can actively cope with the urge in order to avoid smoking . If the would-be ex-smoker does smoke a cigarette in response to the immediate urge or need to smoke, usually he or she does not immediately abandon the quit attempt . Even after the quit attempt is abandoned, it can take weeks or even months before the previous pattern of smoking is re-established, and the smoker usually retains an interest in stopping at a future time point . 
This has led to a re-examination of how Parkinson's disease pathology evolves . Several of these symptoms are now recognized as possible prodromal features of Parkinson's disease . A mouse model suggesting a gastrointestinal route for the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease has also been reported . The cause of neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease is unknown . excitotoxin- and xenobiotic-related cell death . Pathological studies have shown reduced glutathione levels in patients who died from Parkinson's disease, suggesting excessive utilization of glutathione by free radicals . Although there is some evidence that cell injury related to free radicals is implicated in Parkinson's disease, this is not certain . Iron levels are increased in brains affected by Parkinson's disease, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders . Many studies have found complex 1 defects in patients with Parkinson's disease . It is estimated that 70-80% of nigral neurons are lost before clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease become apparent . These sporadic observations have sparked research to determine how normal healthy cells may acquire Parkinson's disease . Additionally, microglial proliferation has been found postmortem in people with Parkinson's disease, suggesting ongoing neuronal death . A large study (the Parkinson's Associated Risk Study [PARS]), involving 7500 relatives of patients with Parkinson's disease, is under way to confirm these findings . While this model explains many of the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, there are several inconsistencies . The aging process is intricately related to the development of Parkinson's disease but is not solely responsible, as some patients develop the disease early in life . Furthermore, the type of dopamine-cell loss in normal aging differs from that in Parkinson's disease . Certain personality traits and environmental factors may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease developing . People with a family history of Parkinson's disease are also at higher risk of developing the disease (see Genetics, pages 31 -) . A few studies have found consumption of well water to be a risk factor, and Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in farming communities . To date, the mechanisms by which genetic changes alter the risk of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood . Genetic investigation of Parkinson's disease is complicated by the same factors that influence the study of its epidemiology . The familial patterns of Parkinson's disease can be masked if affected family members die before clinical signs become apparent . Familial risk . Individuals with a positive family history have twice the risk of developing Parkinson's disease symptoms . The risk for siblings is increased significantly if there is an affected sibling with young-onset Parkinson's disease . Large kindred studies . Several families with Parkinson's disease or atypical parkinsonism have been described . However, the SNCA and PARK3 mutations have not been found in many families with autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease or sporadic Parkinson's disease . The same genetic mutation has been found in European families in individuals with juvenile or young-onset Parkinson's disease . Mutation in LRRK2 has been associated with familial late-onset Parkinson's disease and a few cases of sporadic late-onset Parkinson's disease . Studies in twins have been performed since 1967 . However, Parkinson's disease may be asymptomatic in the unaffected twin . studied 18-fluorodopa PET scans in sets of twins in which one of each pair had clinical Parkinson's disease . Therefore, it seems that some genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease is likely . A widely accepted approximate figure for the prevalence of Parkinson's disease is 200 per 100 000 individuals . Parkinson's disease has been found in all the ethnic populations studied; however, sporadic reports suggest that patterns of parkinsonism may differ between different ethnic groups . In 1967, Hoehn and Yahr published the first mortality study of Parkinson's disease in the pre-levodopa era . Several researchers have suggested that disability and mortality in Parkinson's disease show a sex difference, with significantly greater mortality in women . However, there are other studies suggesting a poorer prognosis in men . In general, before the use of levodopa the relative risk of death with Parkinson's disease was about 3.0 . So the longer people live with Parkinson's disease, the higher the mortality rate . The confusion regarding mortality in Parkinson's disease may be partly because the disease itself is not a primary or direct cause of death . The cause of death in Parkinson's disease is most commonly a secondary comorbid disorder . 
The high concentration of AChRs is crucial for efficient neuromuscular transmission . Myasthenia gravis (MG) is the best characterized autoimmune disorder of the nervous system . Acetylcholine receptor antibodies . A series of animal and human experiments in the 1970s confirmed the above hypothesis, and elevated titers of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were ultimately discovered in the serum of patients with MG . Loss of AChRs results in impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness . Multiple pathological processes cause loss of functional AChRs in MG . accelerated internalization and degradation of AChRs . In fact, elevated MAC levels have been demonstrated in the plasma of patients with MG . 'Binding' antibodies are the most common type found in patients with MG . A key mechanism of disease pathology in MG is the modulation, internalization and eventual destruction of AChRs at the NMJ by the crosslinking of AChR-specific autoantibodies (Figure 2.3) . Direct blockade of acetylcholine receptors by antibodies . 'Blocking' antibodies are the second most common type found in patients with MG . These antibodies block the binding of ACh to AChRs on the muscle endplate (Figure 2.4) . Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies . Although most patients with generalized MG have antibodies to AChR (see below), a minority of patients without AChR antibodies have antibodies to the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) . As discussed in Chapter 1, a higher percentage of patients with treatment-refractory MG have been found to have MuSK antibodies than those who respond to treatment . The disease can be particularly severe in patients with MuSK antibodies (see below) . At present it is unclear how MuSK antibodies cause MG, but it is possible that MuSK antibodies alter AChR density or number . The antibodies in MuSK MG are largely of the IgG4 subclass and have been demonstrated in vitro to block the assembly and activation of MuSK . Approximately 75% of patients who undergo thymectomy are found to have thymic pathology . Myoid cells are located in the thymus gland, and thymus tissue from patients with MG has been found to be enriched with AChR-reactive T cells . MG can be classified in a variety of ways . by disease type . by antibody status . by disease severity . Classification by disease type . Ocular MG, which causes only ptosis and/or diplopia, occurs in approximately 15% of cases; generalized disease occurs in the remainder . Classification by antibody status . Antibodies to AChR . As noted above, MG is most often caused by antibodies to the AChR . This is the case for 85% of cases of generalized disease and approximately 50% of cases of purely ocular MG . AChR antibodies are highly specific for the diagnosis of MG, although the degree of elevation in titers has never been found to correlate with the severity of disease . Antibodies to muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) occur in about 7% of cases of generalized MG but are rarely reported in isolated ocular disease . In general, treatment-refractory MG and myasthenic crises are more common in this subset of the disease . Seronegative for AChR or MuSK antibodies . Included in this group are a small percentage of patients with antibodies only to 'clustered' AChRs . These patients are more likely to be younger and have milder disease than other patients with MG . Other antibodies . Antibodies to lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), agrin and cortactin have recently been found in a small percentage of patients with MG . Further discovery of pathogenic antibodies and improvements in antibody detection are likely to decrease the percentage of patients who are ultimately diagnosed with seronegative MG . Classification by disease severity . Osserman was the first to classify patients with MG according to disease severity . Group I - ocular . Group IIA - mild generalized . Group IIB - moderate-to-severe generalized . Group III - acute, severe, developing over weeks to months . 
The presentation of patients with glioblastoma overlaps with a range of other conditions . Histological diagnosis of glioblastoma is therefore mandatory and is usually obtained through stereotactic biopsy or after tumor resection . Morphological features . The initial step in the diagnosis of glioblastoma is morphological assessment of the tumor . The matrix of these tumors is fibrillary, formed by processes of tumor cells and often involving underlying central nervous system (CNS) tissue that is overrun by tumor cells . A further characteristic feature of high-grade gliomas is the presence of necrotic tumor cells of varying form and shape . Palisading necrosis is typical in glioblastoma, but larger areas of sharply demarcated necrotic tumor are also commonly seen . When assessing gliomas, it must be borne in mind that some tumors with the molecular profile of a glioblastoma (see below) may not have all high-grade features . It is increasingly apparent that diffuse infiltrating gliomas may not have high-grade features when diagnosed early . Some tumors can be robustly diagnosed with these antibodies alone, particularly tumors with IDH and ATRX mutations and H3.3 K27M mutated tumors . Many high-grade gliomas can be classified by a selection of the markers described above . This chapter focuses on the diagnostic use of imaging in patients with suspected glioma/glioblastoma . The role of imaging in the management of patients with glioblastoma is discussed in Chapter 4 . Computed tomography has a low soft tissue contrast, therefore its role in diagnosing glioma is limited . CT is commonly the first imaging test to be carried out when patients newly present with symptoms of glioblastoma; it is often sufficient to exclude the need for immediate neurosurgical intervention . Anatomic magnetic resonance imaging . All patients with suspected or confirmed glioblastoma should have an MRI scan . T2-weighted and FLAIR images are most valuable for estimating macroscopic tumor boundaries: FLAIR increases the overall contrast between the tumor and normal brain tissue, and may thus facilitate lesion detection, while the loss of grey-white matter detail, indicative of tumor, is well delineated on T2 images . For this reason, T2 imaging should always be reviewed when assessing the extent of glioma infiltration . Microscopic tumor infiltration, which is a typical feature of glioblastoma, remains occult on anatomic MRI . Similarly, imaging cannot reliably differentiate between peritumoral edema and infiltration . Numerous anatomic imaging features have been explored as biomarkers of glioma subtype, specifically glioblastoma . Distinguishing glioblastoma from other diseases is often, but not always, straightforward (Figure 3.3) . After obtaining a baseline image volume, gadolinium contrast is rapidly injected and the same image volume is repeatedly acquired at short (1-2 second) intervals for 1-2 minutes . rCBV increases (< 1.75 compared to normal white matter) in areas of neovascularization and is particularly elevated in glioblastoma . Blood volume is typically raised in aggressive IDH wild-type gliomas, but small (exempli gratia early) glioblastomas can elicit false-negative perfusion results . Examples of magnetic resonance perfusion imaging in glioblastoma are shown in Figure 3.5 . In general, diffusion decreases as tissue cellularity increases . This feature can occur in glioblastoma, but malignant gliomas are more likely to exhibit diffusion values similar to or slightly greater than normal brain tissue . Perilesional edema and infiltration may be seen as a focally increased ADC signal that makes the tumor core appear relatively darker, leading to overestimation of tumor restriction . Other diffusion techniques . Lactate is not present in normal tissues, but accumulates in rapidly proliferating tumors as an effect of tissue hypoxia (Figure 3.7) . Lipids are markers of necrosis, which can also (non-specifically) increase in glioblastoma . MRS has limited accuracy for glioma grading and is preferentially used to distinguish tumors from non-neoplastic conditions . For this reason, FDG is not widely used in clinical glioma imaging . PET imaging is rarely indicated in clinical practice for untreated glioma characterization . 
Pancreatic cancer usually arises in the head of the pancreas (80%) and less commonly in the body (15%) or tail (5%) . Other tumors that arise in the pancreas, or in close proximity to it, are part of the differential diagnosis in a patient with suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma . pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors . pancreatic lymphoma . metastatic tumors . It can be activated by various factors and is involved in pancreatic cell transformation, tumor formation and progression . Familial pancreatic cancer is rare, although germline mutations of the BRCA2 gene are found in 10-20% of such families . Other families have a combination of pancreatic cancer and melanoma in which there are germline mutations of the gene p16 Ink4a . Furthermore, a variety of familial pancreatic syndromes have a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer . There is also an association with diabetes mellitus, especially in older patients . Symptoms and signs of pancreatic cancer are shown in Table 11.2 . Weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal and back pain can also be suggestive of pancreatic head cancer, although they are more frequently encountered in body and tail tumors . Pancreatic cancer should be suspected in any patient (over 40 years of age) with unresolving epigastric symptoms . Serum cancer antigen (CA) 19.9 is a useful tumor marker, but not all pancreatic adenocarcinomas have elevated CA 19.9 . This should never be used alone to exclude a pancreatic cancer . There are certainly geographic variations in the use of transabdominal ultrasound as the initial test for imaging the pancreas when a pancreatic cancer is suspected . CT may be supplemented by EUS, MRI and laparoscopy . Positron-emission tomography (PET) is not routinely used in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer . However, PET in combination with CT or MRI may play an important role in the future for the staging of pancreatic cancer and patient stratification . Preoperative tissue diagnosis may not always be needed in a resectable pancreatic mass if the symptoms, signs, laboratory data and imaging are classic for pancreatic cancer in an otherwise surgically fit patient . Tissue diagnosis may be needed in borderline resectable pancreatic tumors if the patient is to undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy before surgery . Emerging data show that EUS and MRI may be used for secondary screening of high-risk groups, such as those at risk of familial pancreatic cancer . Palliative treatment . Up to 10-20% of patients undergo pancreatic resection, with an overall median survival of 11-20 months, and a 5-year survival rate of 7-25%; virtually all patients die within 7 years of surgery . According to published guidelines, all patients with pancreatic cancer must be treated in a specialist high-volume center by a multidisciplinary team (Figure 11.5) . If the tumor is resectable and there are no metastases then resection should be undertaken . If resection is not possible then non-surgical treatment should be undertaken . Some centers have pioneered and established the approach of preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery in borderline resectable patients to improve survival . Curative surgical treatment . The overall mortality for major pancreatic resections is less than 5% in large centers but is much higher otherwise . Total pancreatectomy is reserved for large tumors . Complications following major pancreatic surgery occur in around 30% of patients and require close monitoring (Table 11.3) . Adjuvant treatment . Adjuvant treatment following pancreatic resection is frequently used and consists of chemotherapy with or without the use of radiation . Improved methods for early diagnosis to improve survival in this very lethal cancer . Improved chemotherapy regimens to improve survival in locally advanced and metastatic patients . Centralization of treatment in reference centers with multidisciplinary teams . Better definition of high-risk patients for inclusion in screening programs using MRI and EUS . This is an evolving technique that measures the metabolism in tumor cells . Individual treatment based on the molecular characteristics of each tumor and the pharmacogenomic constitution of the patient . Novel biological therapies and cancer vaccination . 
Because of past harms associated with research involving human participants, there is an expectation and, in many cases, a regulatory requirement that an ethics committee review will take place in advance of the research commencing . These regulations were initiated in 1974 as part of the National Research Act . An IRB can be a part of the organization conducting the research (id est medical center or university) or operate as an independent fee-for-service entity . The IRB is responsible for reviewing research that involves human participants to evaluate compliance with federal regulations and application of ethical principles . The IRB also reviews the proposed research to make sure that participants selected to participate represent those most likely to benefit from its results . Moreover, the IRB wants to make sure that people who are invited to participate in research have a good understanding of the study purpose and what they will be asked to do . Federal regulations and accepted ethical principles are in place to guide the conduct of research so that the science is rigorous and the participants are protected . In any research, an important step is to determine if people involved in the testing phase are considered to be human participants in the research . The federal regulations include definitions for what qualifies as 'research' and 'human subject' and address the responsibilities of the organization and research team . The IRB review and approval are usually needed if the activity is considered to be research and the people involved with testing meet the definition of a human subject (exempli gratia clinical or non-clinical research) . IRB review criteria and pathways . exempt from the Common Rule . expedited review . When a study is exempt, it means that the Common Rule does not apply to the research . Normally, the IRB decides whether a study meets the criteria for exemption, expedited or full committee review . Expedited review . The only difference between an expedited and convened committee review is the number of people involved in evaluating the research plan . An expedited review can be conducted by a subset of the IRB membership, which is usually the IRB chair and one other member . Any study that does not qualify for exempt or expedited review is evaluated by a convened group of IRB members . For research covered by the Common Rule, documentation of informed consent is required, though this may be waived . IRB application . Once the type of review is known, an IRB application is developed by the research team that includes a detailed research protocol and a draft of the informed consent document . The protocol will briefly describe the scientific literature that the study is building from, as well as the study aims, procedures, participant inclusion criteria, risks, benefits, risk management, data management, investigator qualifications and informed consent details . Application of ethical principles . Researchers have applied these principles and relied on IRBs to help shape ethical research practices for nearly half a century . While IRB approval is an important step in the process for identifying and mitigating risk in studies, it is truly the responsibility of developers, researchers and clinicians to be a part of the ethical decision-making process . Of course, these regulations and ethical principles are sometimes difficult to put into practice . CORE initiative . Launched in 2015 at the University of California, San Diego, USA, the CORE initiative is a learning 'ethics' resource developed to support the digital medicine research community, including researchers and IRBs . The checklist prompts researchers to think about ethics, privacy, risks and benefits, access and usability, and data management (see) (Figure 5.2) . Neither are obligated to apply the federal regulations to protect research participants unless, of course, they are developing an FDA-covered product or are conducting federally funded research . The MobileELSI project will develop recommendations to guide the conduct of unregulated digital medicine research . For example, the 'Elements of Informed Consent' toolkit (Figure 5.3) is available to researchers to help them think through developing an effective informed consent process on a mobile device . Ethics when an IRB review is not required . When research involves retrospective analysis of existing data or prospective observation, testing or experimenting with people to generate 'generalizable' knowledge, an IRB review is needed . However, those involved decided to publish the study results to share knowledge produced with the public . Sharing knowledge is believed by research ethicists and the scientific community to be a responsibility to society - which is certainly a good thing . In this case, though, many users were outraged about being involved in research that they did not consent to . 
Patients with glioblastoma have specific information needs . Patients need time to ask questions and receive honest answers . Standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma . The aim of surgery is maximum tumor resection while maintaining neurological function . The neurosurgeon's preoperative assessment of the patient's prognosis - which will depend, among other things, on the location of the glioblastoma and the patient's performance status - will determine the extent of resection . Complete tumor resection is not curative, but is associated with longer overall survival (OS) than partial resection; the worst outcomes are in patients with unresectable tumors . Postoperative care . Patients typically spend the night after surgery in an intensive care unit followed by an in-patient stay of 3-10 days . Recovery will depend on the location of the resected tumor and the patient's age and overall health . CT has excellent sensitivity for the detection of blood, which makes it a useful initial investigation in patients who deteriorate after surgery . Antibiotics are usually given for 24 hours after surgery, along with anticoagulants until the patient is ambulatory . Anticonvulsants and steroids should be prescribed and tapered according to the patient's clinical status . Patients are usually advised to restrict the level of exercise in the immediate days after they leave hospital . The survival benefit in patients who received adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy continued to the 5-year follow-up, including in patients aged 60-70 years . Indeed, the conditional probability of survival may offer relevant information for patients with glioblastoma who survive for some time . This finding was corroborated in a later retrospective study of 882 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of glioblastoma in the temozolomide treatment era . A pooled analysis of individual patient data from four randomized trials involving patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide has been reported . The analysis included patients who received six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide and were progression free 28 days later (n > 624), with patients grouped into those who received up to six or more than six cycles . Managing treatment-related adverse events . The side effects of radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide can affect each patient differently, but they are not unique to patients with glioblastoma and can be medically managed . Follow-up . Glioblastoma recurrence versus therapy effects . Other follow-up tests . Treatment of progressive glioblastoma . Tumor recurrence after initial standard of care therapy is virtually inevitable . A standard of care has not been established for glioblastoma that progresses after chemotherapy . For patients who meet the inclusion criteria and are considered fit enough for further treatment, enrolment into clinical trials is recommended . Surgery may be considered, particularly if the tumor exerts a mass effect . Patients with glioblastoma experience a range of uncontrolled symptoms at different stages of the disease, including pain, seizures and fatigue . Patients may also utilize complementary therapies (exempli gratia meditation, aromatherapy, massage) to manage stress and anxiety and for general well-being . As many patients lose the ability to make decisions about their care at the end of life, advance directives are essential to ensure that the patient's wishes are respected . Valuable patient outcomes include minimal hospitalization and interventional care, early hospice enrolment and death outside of hospital . Elderly patients . Population studies have reported that survival declines with age in patients with glioblastoma, and the incidence of glioblastoma is increasing, especially among the elderly . A single-center retrospective study of consecutive patients from 2004 to 2008 reported that elderly patients (>= 70 years) with glioblastoma were most likely to be treated with best supportive care or palliative radiotherapy . The pivotal EORTC-NCIC study that demonstrated the survival benefit of adding concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma only recruited patients aged 70 years and younger . Subgroup analysis showed that the benefit of chemoradiotherapy was particularly evident in patients with methylated MGMT status . Thus, combination therapy should be considered for fit elderly patients with glioblastoma . 
Prevention versus treatment . Current therapy of osteoarthritis (OA) largely aims to treat existing disease by controlling its major symptom - pain - and maintain or improve joint and limb function and improve quality of life . While there are numerous therapies targeted against symptoms, at present no treatments have been definitively shown to modify the structural progression of OA . Currently, the best advice we can give on preventing OA relates to the following lifestyle modifications . avoid joint trauma . A healthy diet is important to aid weight control, but no diets or dietary supplements have been shown to prevent, or to modify the progression of, OA . Management of OA . There are many evidence-based guidelines from a variety of specialty societies for managing OA (see Key references, page 72) . These guidelines agree on several main principles for the treatment of the disease . People with OA should be involved in their own management, and should receive education about their condition and the range and safety of treatment options available . Therapies, particularly pharmacological ones, need to be tailored according to an individual person's comorbidities and risk factors . Exercise and weight management should be recommended to all patients . Table 6.1 summarizes the hierarchy of options that should be considered for managing individuals with OA . Remember, none of these therapies is mutually exclusive and patients who are not responding should be offered as many options as possible before surgery is considered . Therapies will need to be tailored according to an individual patient's comorbidities and preferences . intra-articular therapy, particularly intra-articular hyaluronans (see Chapter 9) . Very importantly, we should not confuse what clinicians advise or prescribe with how patients manage their own OA . There is little research on what patients actually do, but certainly compliance, perhaps more so with self-directed therapies, such as exercise, is often low . Clinicians therefore need to adapt the consultation to the needs of the individual patient to reach agreement on a suitable and sustainable management plan . The subsequent chapters give an overview of the rationale, evidence and clinical hints for using a particular therapy . Problems with interpreting the OA therapy literature . The practicing clinician may well be overwhelmed at times with the number of publications on a given therapy . However, some critical analysis of trial data is important . Some of the common problems in interpreting OA trials include . the use of different definitions (exempli gratia of OA) . the use of different outcome measures . the degree of clinical significance . Different definitions . Studies use different definitions of OA, focusing on symptoms, clinical features, radiographic findings, or a combination of these . For example, many studies of knee OA do not evaluate the patellofemoral joint, which is a common site of pain in OA of the knee, and few studies consider multiple joint involvement . Use of different outcome measures . The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Core Set (OMERACT) for OA recommends collecting data on pain, function and quality of life; however, there are many instruments for measuring these domains, and they have different performance metrics . As these tools may be used as averaged daily measures or at single time points, care needs to be taken when comparing studies . Most trials (of drugs in particular) tend to include relatively healthy patients and do not reflect the usual older OA population with a high frequency of comorbidities . In addition, trial participants may have only one painful joint, whereas large community samples suggest that, in practice, patients over 55 years of age may have an average of four painful joints . Degree of clinical significance . Many studies have reported a statistically significant difference between two trial therapies without reporting whether the result is important clinically . This may sometimes be expressed as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) . The MCID may vary depending on the measure used to estimate a patient's symptoms . Although the reader should look at specific data for individual outcome measures, in general, a treatment effect of at least 20% is desirable . Structured care pathways . With the massive rise of symptomatic OA due to the aging 'baby boomer' population and the increasing prevalence of obesity, healthcare systems are being placed under increasing stress to manage OA . Certainly, public and private systems will increasingly look at the structure and cost-effectiveness of OA care regimens . 
Most myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic conditions that remain clinically stable for many years; however, the condition may progress to acute leukemia in a minority of patients, referred to as MPN blast phase (MPN-BP) . This transformation most commonly occurs in patients with myelofibrosis, in whom transformation rates of 15-30% have been reported, compared with 1-4% for patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 4-9% for those with polycythemia vera (PV) . Typically, patients with ET or PV initially develop post-ET or post-PV myelofibrosis, which may subsequently undergo transformation to MPN-BP, although in rare cases these conditions may transform directly into MPN-BP without an intermediate myelofibrotic stage . Risk factors for the development of MPN-BP include leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and unfavorable karyotype (Table 9.1) . There are no specific diagnostic criteria for MPN-BP . The principal criterion is the same as for de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML): more than 20% blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood . Persistence is also important if only peripheral blood blasts are considered . Importantly, acceleration or progression of myelofibrosis is usually apparent before the development of overt leukemia . progressive and resistant splenomegaly . increasing numbers of blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood . In addition, recent evidence suggests that progression during treatment with Janus kinase inhibitors is associated with a risk of MPN-BP . MPN-BP is associated with a poor prognosis: median survival is 2-6 months, although this may be prolonged by intensive treatment and prompt recourse to stem cell transplantation (SCT) . There is no standard of care for MPN-BP, and many of the current treatment regimens (Table 9.2) are derived from experience in AML . Induction chemotherapy and SCT . In general, MPN-BP should only be treated with induction chemotherapy when allogeneic SCT is planned in eligible patients . The induction chemotherapy regimens are the same as those used in AML, and response rates are similar to those seen in poor-risk AML patients: typically, complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rates are 40-50%, although rates of approximately 70% have been reported with a combination of cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline . However, these responses are not durable, having a median duration of approximately 5 months . Eligible patients should therefore undergo SCT as soon as possible . The importance of this is highlighted by a study in which median overall survival in patients who completed allogeneic SCT following CR/CRi with induction chemotherapy was 47 months, compared with 9.4 months in those who achieved a CR/CRi but did not go on to SCT . Two-year overall survival rates were 47% and 17%, respectively . Achieving a CR is essential for successful SCT . In one study, 8 of 13 patients proceeded to SCT after induction chemotherapy and were followed for a median of 20 months . All five who achieved CR had returned to chronic MPN at the time of SCT but remained in remission, whereas 2 of 3 patients with persistent marrow or circulating blasts died . Patients with MPN-BP who are not eligible for induction chemotherapy or SCT may benefit from treatment with hypomethylating agents . In one study involving 54 patients with MPN-BP or a condition suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome, treatment with azacitidine resulted in an overall response rate (CR + CRi + partial response) of 28% after a median of 20 months' follow-up, and median overall survival was 8 months in the MPN-BP group . However, support for this approach currently comes mainly from small case series . 
Although there is a trend towards earlier detection of prostate cancer, many men worldwide still present with widespread metastatic disease . Some of the trials with important results for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer are summarized at the end of this chapter (see Table 7.4) . LHRH analogs . A potential side effect is tumor 'flare' resulting from the initial transient increase (140-170%) in testosterone, experienced by 8-32% of patients . Tumor flare can be avoided by prior and concomitant administration of an antiandrogen during the first 4-6 weeks of LHRH analog treatment . The LHRH antagonist degarelix has shown positive clinical results in controlled clinical studies involving men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (Figure 7.3) . A rapid reduction in testosterone without flare was achieved with this antagonist, compared with the significant flare associated with an LHRH analog . An additional potential benefit could be in men receiving intermittent hormonal therapy, in whom the rapid return to normal LHRH receptor function following withdrawal of the drug results in an accompanying rapid return of testosterone . Although both orchidectomy and LHRH treatment produce dramatic initial responses in 70-80% of men, remission is not usually maintained in the long term . Several trials have shown that maximal androgen blockade using an LHRH analog in combination with an antiandrogen improves survival compared with either LHRH analog treatment alone or orchidectomy . However, other trials have not shown significant improvements in tumor progression and survival, and a meta-analysis of all studies demonstrated little or no advantage with the combined therapy . This discrepancy may arise from steroidal and non-steroidal antiandrogens being evaluated together - a subgroup analysis of combination treatment with non-steroidal antiandrogens showed a small survival advantage of 2.9% for combination therapy compared with monotherapy . The timing of hormonal therapy . in 2006 found that delayed hormonal treatment in men with pelvic lymph node metastases was associated with a sevenfold increase in deaths from prostate cancer compared with those who had immediate androgen ablation therapy . A study that explored the timing of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men who experienced a rising PSA after primary treatment of prostate cancer reported a 45% decrease in OS in those who delayed therapy (by >= 2 years) compared with those who had immediate treatment . It is clear that early initiation of hormone therapy in men with locally advanced or metastatic disease improves survival and decreases complications . It should be borne in mind, however, that earlier treatment with hormonal therapy increases the risk of side effects such as osteoporosis . Intermittent hormonal therapy . In this approach, hormone therapy is initially given for 6-9 months . In some studies of intermittent hormonal therapy, up to five treatment cycles were given before evidence of castrate resistance appeared; men spent approximately 50% of the time off therapy . Two randomized trials have compared intermittent versus continuous treatment in men with advanced prostate cancer . The first study, from Canada, included 1386 men with a rising PSA after failure of radiotherapy, who were randomized to continuous or intermittent hormone therapy . The results from a US study of 1535 men with metastatic prostate cancer who were randomized to continuous or intermittent hormone treatment were statistically inconclusive, although there was a trend for longer survival in men receiving continuous treatment (5.8 years, vs 5.1 years in men receiving intermittent treatment) . It appears that intermittent hormone therapy is safe and preferable in men with a rising PSA level, whereas men with confirmed metastatic disease may be better treated with continuous therapy . Androgen deprivation in combination with chemotherapy . In the CHAARTED study, 790 men with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer were randomized to ADT, either alone or in combination with six cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy . The combination therapy was associated with a 33% improvement in OS (median 58 vs 44 months) . Men who had a high volume of metastases seemed to benefit the most . In the STAMPEDE study, a significant difference in OS was reported in men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who received ADT in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy compared with those who received androgen deprivation alone . In a subgroup analysis of men with metastatic prostate cancer, OS was improved by 27% with combination therapy . There is now good evidence that, at least in men with high-volume hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, giving early docetaxel chemotherapy in addition to androgen deprivation therapy improves survival . 
Conventional antiemetics are more successful at preventing emesis than nausea . Current data from multiple large studies suggest that neither first- nor second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT) receptor antagonists (RAs) are effective in the control of nausea in patients receiving either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC or HEC, respectively), despite marked improvement in the control of emesis . Multiple large phase III trials have also shown that although the neurokinin (NK)-1 RA aprepitant is effective for the control of emesis, it is not effective in controling nausea in patients receiving MEC or HEC . Similarly, phase III clinical trial data indicate that the new neurokinin (NK)-1 RAs netupitant and rolapitant are not effective antinausea agents,, although rolapitant may have some effect in patients receiving cisplatin HEC . These studies suggest that the serotonin (5-HT) and substance P (NK-1) receptors may not be important in the mediation of nausea, despite their important role in chemotherapy-induced emesis (see page 11) . New studies using novel agents and using nausea as the primary endpoint need to be performed . Olanzapine appears to have high potential for the control of both emesis and nausea in patients receiving MEC or HEC (Table 6.1) . Phase III studies suggest that olanzapine may be an important agent in the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea . Olanzapine is known to affect a wide variety of receptors including dopamine D, 5-HT 2C, histaminic and muscarinic receptors . At present, there is still a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced nausea, and any or all of these receptors may be important mediators . The addition of olanzapine to the 5-HT RA azasetron and dexamethasone has been shown to improve nausea and emesis compared with azasetron and dexamethasone alone in patients receiving MEC and HEC . Olanzapine, palonosetron and dexamethasone has been shown to improve the control of nausea compared with aprepitant, palonosetron and dexamethasone in patients receiving HEC . Breakthrough nausea and emesis was controlled with olanzapine in patients receiving HEC and guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics . The addition of olanzapine to aprepitant, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone significantly improved nausea and emesis compared with aprepitant, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone alone in patients receiving HEC . Olanzapine is available as a generic . Other agents . Preliminary small studies with gabapentin have demonstrated some effectiveness in the control of chemotherapy-induced emesis, but the control of nausea has yet to be determined . More studies with the use of cannabinoids need to be performed before it is known whether this class of agent is clinically efficacious in the control of CINV . The studies performed to date do not support the use of ginger as an effective agent in the prevention of CINV . Few randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of non-pharmacological measures to prevent or treat chemotherapy-induced nausea . Table 6.2 summarizes measures suggested by case reports . 
Acne vulgaris is the most common type of acne . The individual lesions of acne vulgaris (Figure 3.1) can be characterized as . inflammatory lesions . Microcomedones, the precursors of all acne lesions, may develop into whiteheads or blackheads . Patients may think that these resolving lesions are active acne lesions and may have the erroneous impression that their acne is not improving . It is important to reassure patients that these dark areas are healing lesions and not active acne . Other forms of acne . acnes) only . Acne with solid facial edema . The etiology of this phenomenon is unknown but may relate to lymphatic obstruction secondary to the inflammatory response associated with the acne . Adult female acne . Adult acne, particularly in women, is worthy of special note; many adults have a prolonged course of acne beyond teenage years and in some cases acne may present for the first time in adulthood . Although it is generally less severe than teenage acne, acne in adult women is challenging to treat . In some cases, this form of acne is characterized by tender inflammatory papules or nodules involving the lower third of the face and neck (Figure 3.10) . If an adult woman has sudden-onset severe acne, acne accompanied by signs of hyperandrogenism or acne that is refractory to conventional therapy, a medical history and physical examination directed towards eliciting symptoms or signs of hyperandrogenism should be performed . Acne excoriée (also known as acne excorie or 'acne de jeune filles') is described on pages 46-7 . Acne mechanica . Repetitive rubbing or friction can sometimes exacerbate acne . Acne mechanica tends to occur in cases of moderate-to-severe inflammatory acne and less often in cases of mild acne . Treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying acne and minimizing the mechanical stress on the skin . Occupational acne . Exposure to certain industrial agents can lead to the development of acne . Drug-induced acne . A number of drugs cause or worsen acne or can induce an acneiform eruption (Table 3.5) . In contrast, most drug-induced 'acnes' represent acne-like eruptions embracing monomorphic inflammatory lesions in the absence of comedones, often presenting abruptly outside the most frequent age range for acne and extending over areas not commonly affected by acne . Lithium can worsen existing acne or cause acne de novo . The acne presents 2-3 months after starting therapy . Comedonal lesions are the most frequently seen lesions; inflammatory lesions are usually sparse . If 'acne' is triggered the drug should be withdrawn; response is variable and systemic therapy and physical treatment of the comedones may be required . Estimates suggest that acne is a side effect in as many as 43% of users . Acne may be exacerbated by progestins and has been reported with use of the Mirena coil . Exacerbation or new onset of acne have been described with vitamin B, 5-10 mg/week . Women are almost exclusively affected, with acne developing within the first 2 weeks after the injection . The acne-inducing dose of vitamin B has not been established . acnes cultures promoted the production of porphyrins, providing a potential mechanism of action, as porphyrins induce inflammation in acne . Conventional acne therapies are usually unsuccessful but the acneiform rash settles within 8-10 days of withdrawing the vitamin B therapy . Comedones are not seen . Most reports suggest that topical acne therapies, oral tetracyclines and topical or oral corticosteroids are effective . Gram-negative folliculitis is characterized by the sudden development of superficial pustules in patients who have been treated for acne with antibiotics (Figure 3.16) . Assessing acne severity . Defining acne severity helps with the selection of the most suitable initial therapy and enables response to treatment to be monitored . There are many scales available for assessing the severity of acne, but no consensus on a gold standard . Acne can be classified as comedonal, mild, moderate or severe based on the type of lesions (Table 3.6) . Alternatively, an assessment tool such as the Leeds Revised Acne Grading System allows grading of severity based on photographic comparisons of acne on the face (Figure 3.18), back and chest . Table 3.1 outlines the key elements in developing an accurate acne history . 
The precise pathophysiological mechanisms involved in pain perception in low back pain disorders are not well understood . The signals travel to the central nervous system where they are experienced as pain . Simultaneously, pain-reducing signals travel along the pain inhibitory pathway to reduce pain transmission . Endorphins, neurochemicals stimulating the pain inhibitory pathway, decrease pain and promote a feeling of well-being . Duration of pain is an important characteristic . Acute pain is a warning of acute injury . Therapies directed at control of acute pain, such as simple analgesics and NSAIDs, are effective . Chronic pain is not acute pain that goes beyond the usual time for healing . Chronic pain is mediated through a different set of neurochemicals . Chronic pain causes modifications in nerve cell receptors, membrane thresholds and pathway interactions . These alterations result in increased sensitivity to painful stimuli . With these changes in the nervous system, chronic pain may persist even after the original injury has healed . Chronic pain also has effects on the centers of the brain involving mood and emotions . Chronic pain can add to stress, anxiety and depression, and vice versa . For more information on definitions and mechanisms of pain see Fast Facts: Chronic and Cancer Pain . Psychological factors affecting pain . Any painful stimulus affecting the body is ultimately experienced in the central nervous system . All of these factors must be considered when evaluating the person who presents with the complaint of low back pain . Psychological issues must be addressed concurrently with the anatomic and pathological somatic aspects of low back pain-related disorders . Anatomic structures involved in generating pain . Many anatomic factors can play a primary or a secondary role in the development and progression of low back pain syndromes . The most common causes of low back pain are mechanical in origin . The most important traumatic factors in low back pain relate to soft tissue structures . Precise identification of the injured tissue, and the role of that injury in the consequent pain and dysfunction, can be frustratingly difficult . Problems occur in muscles, intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments or spinal nerves . The severity of the spasm can vary, but the associated pain can be overwhelming . The consequences of disc herniations (Figure 3.2b) range from none (asymptomatic) to agonizing pain and paresis . Other ligaments (Figure 3.3) are the following . The inflammation of the nerve can result in corresponding dermatomal leg pain, numbness, loss of reflex and/or weakness . It should be remembered that a 'pain in the neck' can place a painful burden on the low back . This adds to the vicious cycle of more pain, worsening posture, more mechanical dysfunction, more muscle spasm and more pain, not only in the neck, but in the low back as well . In association with spondylolisthesis, hamstring tightness, another predisposing factor for low back pain, is commonly found . Facet joint malalignments and associated degenerative osteoarthritic changes (Figure 3.6) are commonly noted radiographically with or without, and before and after, any accompanying low back pain disorders . This does not preclude an abnormal facet joint being a causal factor of a low back pain syndrome . This can be confirmed by a selective joint injection of hypertonic saline under fluoroscopic visualization to attempt to reproduce the pain, followed by a local anesthetic injection to provide specific relief of the induced pain . Conservative management of lumbar and lumbosacral painful disorders can usually be successfully undertaken without specifically addressing the sacroiliac joint per se . smaller, more slowly conducting type B fibers that transmit pain and temperature . small unmyelinated type C pain-transmitting fibers . Compression of nerve roots or ganglia per se does not cause pain, but does impair both sensory and motor functioning . Sclerotomal, or deep pain referral patterns are more diffuse and do not follow the classic dermatomes . Spinal stenosis . Not uncommonly, spinal stenosis identified radiographically during differential diagnosis of a low back pain syndrome is considered to be the cause of the pain . Pain is typically brought on by sitting or changing position . Pain may also be referred to the spine from soft tissue injuries or pathology in other organ systems, such as . Causes of low back pain . 
Long-term complications develop in virtually all patients taking continued levodopa therapy . Although levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the initial benefit begins to diminish over time with dyskinesias and fluctuations in motor response (Figure 7.1) . disease severity . Table 7.1 shows the clinically most important indicators, both motor and non-motor, for defining advanced Parkinson's disease, and the functional impact those symptoms are likely to have on the patient . Initial treatment with levodopa will reverse parkinsonian symptoms consistently during the day without fluctuations . Established/unstable Parkinson's disease . Within 2-3 years, most patients begin to experience fluctuations (Table 7.2) . Advanced disease . Fluctuations become increasingly unpredictable over a period of years and are difficult to relate to dopa dosage . 'On/off' syndrome becomes the focus of their lives and is a challenging problem for clinicians (Table 7.4) . Dyskinesias are hyperkinetic states mostly seen in patients with levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease . In the early stage of the disease, these states are often not noticed by patients and are a good sign of dopa responsiveness . Dyskinesias may be socially unacceptable to carers, while patients may prefer to be dyskinetic when 'on' . Reducing dopaminergic drugs will diminish dyskinesia, but may lead to a return of Parkinson's disease symptoms . Dementia is an important cause of comorbidity in parkinsonism; when cognition declines, mortality increases . Dementia is a bad sign and will often lead to the breakdown of support networks . Patients who are confused and hallucinating become difficult to manage at home and are frequently admitted to nursing homes . At this stage, life expectancy may be only 1-2 years . Estimation of the incidence of dementia has proved difficult . This can lead to a false estimation of cognitive function unless time is spent carefully assessing patients . Global intellectual decline (dementia) is usually a feature of parkinsonism in the elderly, with more than 30% of patients over 70 years affected . Memory disturbance may be a warning sign, although younger patients may complain of short-term memory problems for many years . The cause of parkinsonian dementia is unclear . Wandering can be a problem; if confused, the patient will need constant supervision . Depression/anxiety is a marker for dementia in older patients . However, depression must not be mistaken for dementia . Pseudo-dementia can be mistaken for Parkinson's disease dementia . A syndrome of apathy distinct from depression, anxiety and fatigue is increasingly recognized in Parkinson's disease . Psychosis causes gross impairment in reality testing . Psychotic patients evaluate their perceptions abnormally, leading to incorrect interpretation of external reality . Overstimulation of mesencephalic-limbic dopamine receptors causes limbic system dysfunction, leading to psychosis . The management of drug-induced psychosis is outlined in Figure 7.2 . Sleep problems in Parkinson's disease are common and may affect 60-98% of individuals at both early and late stages of the disease . The cause of restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease remains unclear, although it occurs around twice as commonly as in the general population . REM behavior disorder in particular has emerged as an important symptom that may predict the motor diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by years . The condition may cause self or partner injury, as the patient tends to act out violent dreams in REM sleep . Autonomic problems . Autonomic problems occur with increasing frequency in advanced disease, as has been shown in the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) study . Sensory problems . Sensory problems associated with the disease mainly comprise pain syndromes and akathisia, usually in the 'off' state . Pain is a key unmet need in Parkinson's disease and can be of several types . Declaration of non-motor symptoms . An international study showed that large numbers of patients do not declare these symptoms unless specifically asked . This can lead to a shocking neglect of symptoms that may be treatable, even in well-established centers of Parkinson's disease care . The NMSQuest (see Figure 3.5) empowers patients to declare their non-motor symptoms to health professionals (see Figure 3.6) . 
Neurocognitive impairments . People with schizophrenia present with a broad range of neurocognitive impairments . For example, studies of visual information processing have demonstrated subtle impairments in early sensory information processing, which may contribute to impaired performance on more complex neuropsychological tasks . Cognitive function in schizophrenia is typically one to two standard deviations below normal mean values . Eye-tracking abnormalities . What is the pathophysiology? Neurocognitive impairments may reflect the involvement of specific brain regions or neural circuits, or a more global involvement of the brain . The pattern of predominant impairments suggests the relatively selective involvement of frontotemporal areas . The results of functional imaging studies are also consistent with the selective involvement of frontotemporal areas, although this may be due in part to the nature of the cognitive tasks studied . These studies also implicate the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of these impairments . On the other hand, the pattern of predominant impairments may be more apparent than real . Whether there are a few basic cognitive abnormalities that underlie the broad range of observed cognitive manifestations or whether multiple cognitive processes are independently affected in schizophrenia remains an unresolved issue . How do deficits relate to symptoms and outcome? Patients with negative symptoms are more likely to exhibit clinically significant neurocognitive impairments than patients without these symptoms . Patients with negative symptoms have also exhibited the most impairment on tasks requiring self-generated, rather than stimulus-driven, activity . The relationship of neurocognitive impairments to the broad range of symptom and functional outcomes suggests that the development of effective treatments for these impairments would have far-reaching beneficial effects on people with schizophrenia . Brain dopamine levels are key to the reward system that controls this discrimination of salient stimuli . This can be seen in the lower than expected activation of the ventral striatum on functional MRI . Drug treatment normalizes this deficit . Functional imaging . Whatever else underlies the symptoms and deficits of schizophrenia, there is plainly a disturbance of brain function . Schizophrenia research has, therefore, been quick to use imaging techniques that demonstrate disturbances in brain function . Similar changes of lesser magnitude also occur in brain regions executing a complex cognitive task, such as solving a puzzle . These changes can be used to clarify which areas of the brain are being used to do specific tasks . Molecular imaging . Functional imaging . This produces a map of regional cerebral blood flow and brain activity from the natural change in paramagnetic properties of hemoglobin as it deoxygenates . Image analysis involves two general approaches . Using this approach, images from groups of subjects, or from the same subjects during and after a cognitive challenge, are transformed into identical brain shapes . Chemical imaging . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allows the assessment of brain biochemistry . Proton MRS visualizes a separate set of biochemical processes and suggests reduced frontal glutamate activity in early schizophrenia . Imaging brain function is more difficult than imaging brain structure . A common method of investigating the abnormal brain function underpinning a cognitive deficit is to first scan a control subject before and during the execution of a relevant task . By subtracting the brain activity map as it was before the task from the map during the task, the specific areas of the brain involved in the task will be highlighted . The same brain activity maps are then produced for people with schizophrenia before and during the same task, which can then be compared with the pattern in control subjects . Resting state fMR studies are increasingly being used, with advanced image analysis that detects correlations in activity between brain areas . This abnormal pattern has also been found in unaffected relatives . Mapping symptoms . Functional imaging has been informative at the level of understanding individual symptoms, symptom clusters and specific cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (Figure 7.2) . Among positive symptoms, auditory hallucinations, rather than delusions, have been most extensively studied . During auditory hallucinations, increased blood flow is seen in Broca's area in the left hemisphere . In a healthy brain, a connected area of cortex in the superior temporal gyrus is deactivated during inner speech . Functional imaging shows that this does not occur in hallucinating patients, suggesting that hallucinations may actually be misinterpreted inner speech . In some cases, the link between a specific symptom and a functional abnormality emerges only under particular conditions . Compared with controls, patients with persecutory delusions show increased activation in the amygdala in situations of possible threat . 
However, morphologic description using the FAB terminology is still a common feature of clinical discussion among clinicians and with patients . Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells provides important independent prognostic information and is a feature of both the WHO and ELN systems . Patients with no cytogenetic abnormalities (cytogenetically normal AML; CN-AML) have an intermediate risk ( around 40% cured) . Patients with a complex karyotype such as t(6;9), inv(3) or -7 (absence of chromosome 7) have an adverse prognosis, with few cures, particularly for older patients . Cytogenetic analysis should be performed on the bone marrow aspirate taken at diagnosis in any patient suspected to have AML . Clinical genetic testing for several mutated genes, particularly in patients with cytogenetically normal AML, can help with further risk stratification . The number of genes mutated in AML that are known to have (or suspected of having) prognostic or therapeutic relevance is growing . FLT3 is expressed on nearly all AML cells; the FLT3 gene is mutated and constitutively activated in about 30% of patients with de novo AML . The mutation is most commonly an ITD . Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain are less common (8% of patients) and have uncertain prognostic significance . Clinical presentation . Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) usually present with vague symptoms that are consequences of pancytopenia . Typically, the onset of symptoms is no more than 3 months before diagnosis . Fatigue is a common first symptom (Table 2.1), often accompanied by anorexia and weight loss . Rarely, patients present with symptoms due to extramedullary leukemia (id est outside the blood and marrow), such as myeloid sarcoma (a tumor mass consisting of myeloid blasts); AML may infiltrate skin, lymph nodes, the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissue or testes . Patients who present with isolated myeloid sarcoma typically develop blood and/or marrow involvement quickly thereafter . Fever, infection and hemorrhage are often present at the time of diagnosis . Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy may also be present but are relatively uncommon . Affected patients often present with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-associated hemorrhage and may have intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding at other sites . Retinal hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia and extreme leukocytosis is detected in approximately 15% of patients . Red blood cells . Anemia is usually present at diagnosis but is not severe and is usually normocytic and normochromic (the size of red blood cells and level of hemoglobin are within normal limits) . White blood cells (WBC) . Occasionally, patients may present with no detectable leukemic cells in the blood . While these features strongly suggest a diagnosis of APL, the final diagnosis will require demonstration of the appropriate molecular abnormality by either karyotyping or other molecular methods . Most patients present with at least mild thrombocytopenia (below the normal lower limit of 150 000/μL); about 25% have severe thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts below 25 000/μL . Many bone marrow disorders present with pancytopenia and its attendant signs and symptoms . Myeloproliferative disorders with bone marrow fibrosis can also present similarly . However, acute leukemia is the appropriate diagnosis in patients with circulating blasts visualized on light microscopy . Once a diagnosis of AML is suspected, cytogenetic and genetic tests are required to aid rapid diagnosis, assess prognosis and to inform the best approach to treatment . Cytogenetics has been a part of AML diagnosis for several decades, and typically requires bone marrow for successful testing (the increased number of proliferating cells in marrow yields better results than blood for karyotype analysis) . The diagnosis of AML is based on a finding of 20% or more myeloid blasts by histology, cytochemistry or (more commonly) flow cytometry . 
Despite initial treatment, ovarian cancer will recur in nearly two-thirds of women who originally presented with advanced disease . In this situation, the aims of treatment change from achieving cure to . preserving quality of life by mitigating treatment-related adverse effects and ameliorating symptoms of the recurrent disease . Recurrent ovarian cancer may present in a number of ways, and may be asymptomatic or symptomatic . With asymptomatic (chemical) recurrence, disease may be minimal and the value of treatment in this situation has been challenged . Imaging studies may be ordered if CA125 is not used to monitor for recurrence, but this approach is costly and exposes the patient to significant radiation over time . Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of imaging is suboptimal in ovarian cancer, because patients often exhibit numerous postsurgical changes; moreover, recurrences can occur with small-volume disease . Many clinicians reserve imaging for patients who present with symptoms or physical examination findings that are suggestive of recurrence . Some patients with recurrent ovarian cancer may present with abdominal symptoms such as bloating, early satiety, pain or a change in urinary or bowel habits, or with more systemic symptoms such as fatigue . The choice of treatment in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer will depend on a number of patient-, drug- and tumor-related factors (Figure 7.1) . Nevertheless, the traditional definitions of platinum resistance or sensitivity remain relevant in guiding treatment (Figure 7.2) . Platinum-sensitive patients are generally treated with platinum-containing regimens . Patients in whom recurrence occurs more than 6 months after primary platinum treatment are often subdivided into two groups . highly platinum-sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs more than 12 months after primary platinum treatment . intermediately sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs 6-12 months after primary treatment . Platinum-resistant patients, in whom recurrence occurs within 6 months of primary platinum treatment, are generally treated with non-platinum options; these usually include single agent chemotherapies with or without bevacizumab . Some clinicians define patients who actually progress on front-line treatment as platinum-refractory . They are often treated similarly to platinum-resistant patients, although some clinicians recommend continuing the platinum backbone while substituting the taxane with an alternative chemotherapeutic . The prognosis and probability of response to subsequent treatment correlate directly with the time from the previous platinum or other treatment (Figure 7.3) . It should be emphasized that any patient who can potentially participate in a clinical trial should be offered this option as the preferred treatment . Chemotherapy for platinum-sensitive disease . The initial treatment decision for a patient with platinum-sensitive disease is whether or not to perform surgery (see page 54) . Chemotherapy options for platinum-sensitive disease have continued to expand . Many platinum-sensitive patients will respond to numerous regimens; as described above, some clinicians treat patients with recurrence at 6-12 months differently to those with recurrence more than 12 months after previous platinum treatment . This is especially true when the recurrence is close to the 6-month cut-off, because many such patients have a response and prognosis similar to those who are platinum-resistant . Key Phase III clinical trials with chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease are summarized in Table 7.1 . Biological therapy for platinum-sensitive disease . Bevacizumab represents another option for platinum-sensitive patients . As discussed in Chapter 8, PARP inhibitors confer an excellent response in platinum-sensitive patients, and their role appears to be expanding beyond patients with biomarkers such as BRCA mutations . The challenge for clinicians will be to decide upon the best use of these agents as either treatment or maintenance options in platinum-sensitive patients . Chemotherapy for platinum-resistant disease . Patients with disease that recurs within 6 months of primary platinum treatment are generally treated with single agents, with or without bevacizumab . An important decision for clinicians is how best to use bevacizumab for the treatment of ovarian cancer . In some regions, bevacizumab is used in the front-line setting, while in others it is restricted to platinum-sensitive patients . Both the AURELIA trial in platinum-resistant patients, and the OCEANS trial in platinum-sensitive patients, yielded identical hazard ratios of 0.48 for PFS . Appropriate patient selection is crucial (see Chapter 5) . 
The major respiratory complications of obesity are shown in Table 4.1, all of which impair quality of life . Conventional respiratory function tests are only mildly affected by obesity except in extreme cases . Obesity is associated with reduced lung volume, which is linked with airway narrowing . OSA is associated with an increase in motor vehicle- and work-related accidents . After adjusting for change in velocity during the crashes, obese male drivers show a much higher risk of non-fatal injuries than non-obese male drivers . The extent to which obesity contributes to asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness is uncertain . Central obesity is associated with an increased risk of non-atopic asthma . Obese patients with asthma are less likely than non-obese patients to achieve optimal control of their disease . Weight reduction and physical activity reverse the respiratory complications of obesity . Weight reduction and increased physical activity should be priorities in obese patients to improve insulin sensitivity . Obesity is associated with an increase in symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hospitalization for GERD-related complications . Gallbladder disease . Obese patients are at increased risk for biliary disease, with a higher incidence of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis and cholesterolosis . The incidence of gallbladder disease is increasing in children and adolescents concomitant with the increasing incidence of obesity . Table 4.2 lists the reproductive consequences of obesity . Obesity, particularly when visceral and accompanied by impairment of glucose metabolism, is associated with low plasma total testosterone . Severe obesity may, however, be associated with secondary hypogonadism at a hypothalamic level . It is a consequence of visceral obesity and the associated metabolic abnormalities that induce endothelial dysfunction . OSA is also associated with erectile dysfunction . Weight loss through a lifestyle modification program is associated with improvements in erectile dysfunction in obese men . Weight gain and central adiposity in adulthood are particularly associated with an increased risk of LUTS . Obese men may have fewer sertoli cells than men of normal weight . The effect of weight loss on these abnormalities remains unclear . Urinary incontinence also has an adverse effect on sexual function in obese women . Induction of labor is more likely to be required and there is an increased risk of cesarean section, which in itself is associated with greater risk in obese women . Obesity also increases the risk of complications from surgery and radiation therapy . There is no current consensus regarding appropriate dosing of chemotherapy in the obese patient . Obesity may impact on the risk, detection and outcome of prostate cancer . Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and also cancers with worse pathological features and higher biochemical relapse rates . The relationship between obesity and breast cancer risk as well as the clinical behavior of the disease is complicated . In postmenopausal women, particularly the elderly, obesity is positively associated with risk for breast cancer, whereas before menopause increased bodyweight is inversely related to breast cancer risk . Obesity has also been related to advanced disease at diagnosis and with a poor prognosis . Obesity increases the risk of RCC among women irrespective of fat distribution, whereas low hip circumference is related to increased risk of RCC in men . Alcohol, tobacco and obesity interact to increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma . Obesity is also an important predictor of osteoarthritis progression . Moderate obesity does not appear to affect the outcome of hip or knee replacement surgery in patients with arthritis . Obesity does not appear to confer an independent risk for hip or knee revision procedures . Obesity increases the risk of plantar fasciitis, achilles tendon rupture, meniscal tears, carpal tunnel syndrome and peripheral edema . However, the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity, most commonly depression, is increased in patients seeking treatment for obesity (40-60%) . Extreme obesity is associated with an increased risk for depression, and obese individuals in weight-loss trials experience reductions in symptoms of depression . Obesity in adolescence may be associated with depression in young adulthood . The syndrome is most frequently seen in women and is strongly associated with obesity and a recent increase in weight . Surgery and anesthetic risk . All surgery, but abdominal surgery in particular, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the obese . Table 4.3 shows the main complications of surgery in obese patients . 
For some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, these symptoms cause a dose ceiling, which may be less than an effective dose . Side effects . CBZ should be avoided if the patient tests positive (see Side effects) . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . CLB is a useful adjunctive drug for drug-resistant partial and generalized seizures . Side effects . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . In children, 0.5 mg daily is the usual starting dose . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Allergic rashes are seen in up to 5% of patients . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Side effects . In addition, it may cause hyperactivity in children and elderly patients . Most adults usually achieve satisfactory seizure control with once-daily dosing . Patients with erratic compliance should be treated twice daily to lessen the effect of a missed dose . PHT is associated with rash in approximately 5% of patients . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Side effects . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . The starting dose for adults and adolescents should be 500 mg once or twice daily .

Side effects are generally mild and transient . Weight gain occurs in up to 5% of patients, particularly at higher doses . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . GBP is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, so patients with renal insufficiency need lower doses and less frequent dosing . Side effects . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . In controlled studies, patients with partial seizures responded to 1000-3000 mg daily . Seizures in some patients will be controlled on doses as low as 250 mg twice daily . Side effects . Some patients complain of headache, anorexia and nervousness . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . The recommended starting dose for OXC in adults is 150-600 mg daily in two doses . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions .

Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Side effects . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Side effects . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . A change to three-times-daily dosing is recommended when 30 mg or more is prescribed daily . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Lower doses are required in patients with substantial hepatic, but not renal, impairment . Patients respond to TPM in doses ranging from 50 to 1000 mg daily . The optimum dose for most patients with drug-resistant epilepsy appears to be 200-400 mg twice daily . Some patients respond to doses as low as 50-100 mg daily, particularly if TPM is combined with LTG . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . TPM inhibits the metabolism of PHT in about 10% of patients . VGB is an effective add-on drug for patients with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization . Further increments of 500 mg or 1000 mg daily will depend on the clinical status of the patient . Seizures in most patients will respond to 2000-3000 mg daily . Few show further improvement at higher doses . Side effects . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Allergic rash has also been reported particularly in patients sensitive to sulfonamides . Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions . Patients with renal dysfunction have lower rates of clearance . ZNS itself has no effect on the metabolism of other drugs . 
Lower urinary tract symptoms become more prevalent with age . Management of the symptoms can be challenging, as the elderly are less likely to tolerate surgical or pharmaceutical treatments, and their symptoms are often secondary to multiple causes . Urinary incontinence is a frequent cause of institutionalization in the elderly . Finding the cause of urinary incontinence is more important in the elderly than in younger patients . The elderly are more likely to have multiple coexisting symptoms and may have multiple pathologies to account for them . Empirical treatment based on symptoms and a frequency/volume bladder record can be unsatisfactory . Cystometry is well tolerated in the elderly . Also, in the elderly patient, antimuscarinic drugs may be more likely to cause drowsiness and cognitive impairment . The risk of postoperative urinary retention is relatively high in the elderly because of their reduced detrusor contractility . Nocturia is particularly common in the elderly and is discussed in Chapter 8 . Voiding dysfunction . Stroke may initially cause retention, which is replaced by neurogenic detrusor overactivity . Sensory loss is most commonly caused by diabetes; it may lead to progressive bladder distension, voiding dysfunction and acontractility, resulting in overflow incontinence . Urinary retention . Urinary tract infections are common in elderly women, occurring in up to 46% over the course of a year . Treatment of UTIs in elderly women with no identifiable pathology is with low-dose vaginal estrogen and prophylactic antibiotics, as described in Chapter 7 . Polypharmacy (the use of multiple medications concurrently) is common in the elderly, and incontinence is frequently a result of medications prescribed for other conditions . Lower urinary tract symptoms are common during pregnancy, and childbirth is often cited as a cause for subsequent urinary, colorectal and genital dysfunction . Bladder filling symptoms . Between 45% and 90% of women will develop urinary frequency as pregnancy progresses . Urgency is a common symptom in pregnancy, reported by up to 70% of women . Nocturia is common in pregnancy and is rarely pathological . Stress urinary incontinence in pregnancy is common - it has been reported in up to 85% of pregnant women . It therefore seems likely that both pregnancy and any mode of delivery can cause pelvic floor dysfunction . Voiding symptoms . During pregnancy one-third of women report hesitancy and an inability to empty their bladder completely . Management involves bladder drainage and manual reduction of the uterus . The most common cause of postnatal voiding disorders and urinary retention is the use of epidural and spinal anesthesia during labor and delivery . However, all women are at risk of urinary retention, and careful surveillance during and after delivery is important . Urinary retention requires prompt catheterization . It should be noted that many women have reduced bladder sensation after delivery, and urinary retention may not present with pain . It is more common on the right side . Hydronephrosis is largely asymptomatic and does not require treatment, and will resolve spontaneously on delivery . Urinary tract infections . Fistula-related incontinence . A fistula is an abnormal communication between two epithelialized structures . The urinary tract fistula most commonly responsible for urinary incontinence is the vesicovaginal fistula (VVF; Figure 10.1) . Obstetric trauma accounts for very few cases of VVF in developed countries, but is still a common cause in developing countries as a result of prolonged unsupervised labor . If the fistula is large, the patient may not void normally at all and may have continuous leakage of urine into the vagina . It is important to distinguish VVF from other causes of urinary incontinence; investigations should include a full examination . Examination under anesthesia may be required to determine the presence of a fistula . The site of a fistula can be identified by instilling methylene blue dye into the bladder via a catheter, with the patient in the lithotomy position . The initial management of most urinary tract fistulas is generally conservative . Surgical management . There is some debate as to the timing of surgical treatment of urinary tract fistulas . Early treatment is advocated by some because of the social and psychological benefits to women who are already distressed . The fistula is identified and its tract excised . 
Clinical gene therapy is a very active field, with a large number of clinical trials, approaches and disease targets . Newer technologies such as gene editing will undoubtedly shape the design of future gene therapies . Several examples are described in the following sections . Neuromuscular and neurological disorders . Although results from more patients and longer-term follow-up data are still emerging, initial clinical trial results are quite remarkable . The defect is in a gene called MTM1 that encodes the enzyme myotubularin, which is required for the development and function of skeletal muscle . Approximately half of these children die within the first 1.5 years after birth . In a first clinical trial, nine patients aged from 8 months to 6 years were treated by systemic administration of a high dose of AAV8 vector, with the hope of widely transferring the MTM1 gene to muscle cells . Some patients were able to vocalize sounds for the first time and eat food . These advances were presented at the 2019 annual meeting of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy . Mutations in the ABCD1 gene cause an enzyme deficiency called adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) . Impressively, these patients showed persistent therapeutic levels of aldolase protein for at least 3 years . Demyelination of the CNS was halted, resulting in stabilization of disease without any major safety complications . Cerebral ALD affects boys between ages 4 and 10 years, causing permanent disability; death occurs within 4-8 years of disease onset . As of early 2018, 29 individuals had received the gene therapy . While the CAG segment is normally repeated 10 to 35 times within the HTT gene, people with 40 or more repeats nearly always develop disease . These areas are affected by neuropathological changes at different stages of the disease . Using this approach, sustained lowering of huntingtin protein levels and functional improvements have been demonstrated in a mouse model of the disease . Lysosomal storage disorders . Glycogen storage disease type Ia . The accumulation of glycogen affects functions of multiple tissues . The hypoglycemia that results from the disease can be life-threatening . In preclinical studies, this gene therapy was particularly effective in reducing hepatic glycogen levels . Muscle disorders . Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the X-linked lethal muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin . Individuals with deleterious mutations in dystrophin typically show signs of muscle weakness at 2 to 3 years of age, followed by substantial deterioration of muscle function by 7 years of age . Correction of the disease by gene transfer is substantially complicated by the large size of the dystrophin gene (covering 2.3 mb, making it one of the largest known genes) and the need to correct a large number of muscles throughout the body . The dystrophin protein is made up of 3685 amino acid residues . Using these constructs, dystrophin transgene expression in muscle fibers of patients has already been demonstrated following local intramuscular administration of vector . Multiple competing Phase I/II clinical trials have now been initiated to test this approach in patients with DMD (Figure 6.2) . For instance, dystrophic muscles may be inflamed, and T-cell responses against therapeutic dystrophin have been observed in some patients in prior clinical studies . Mutations in globin genes can cause various forms of anemia . Deficiency in either alpha-globin or beta-globin causes an imbalance in the adult globin chains, resulting in alpha- or beta-thalassemia . No ideal treatments are available, making these diseases major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide . Gene therapy based on lentiviral transduction of HSCs should be a route to a cure for these diseases . However, there is no selective advantage for gene-corrected cells, and obtaining sufficient levels of the globin transgene product has not been easy to accomplish . Myeloablative conditioning was performed to create space for the gene-corrected cells . The first patient treated in this manner gained independence from blood transfusions by 1 year after gene therapy . Sickle cell disease . This individual no longer required red blood cell transfusions and had a substantial clinical improvement that has been stable for at least 4 years . Several current clinical trials are now attempting to reproduce this positive outcome . 
Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition . In high-income countries, approximately 6 per 1000 people will develop epilepsy during their lifetime, and 45 people per 100000 will develop new-onset epilepsy each year . These figures are nearly twice as high in low- and middle-income countries, possibly as a consequence of more primitive obstetric services as well as the greater likelihood of cerebral infection and head trauma . Incidence varies greatly with age, with high rates in early childhood, low levels in early adult life and a second peak in people aged over 65 years (Figure 1.1) . In recent years, there has been a fall in the number of children affected as well as a sharp rise in epilepsy in the elderly . Indeed, old age has now become the most common time in life to develop the condition . Most patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis . In many people - particularly children - the condition will remit, although a substantial proportion will have epilepsy all their lives . Overall, 60-70% of patients become seizure free after the start of treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) . Some of these patients become and remain seizure free on the initiation of the first AED, while in others the disorder appears to follow a more fluctuating course . Some patients can remain in remission after subsequent drug withdrawal, implying that the epileptogenic causes have truly remitted . The other 30-40% of patients continue to have seizures with varying degrees of frequency and severity . It is also increasingly recognized that some patients can have a 'remitting-relapsing' course, fluctuating between periods of seizure freedom and recurrence . Factors that indicate a poor prognosis for seizure control include . poor response to the initial AED treatment . symptomatic cause . high seizure frequency before AED treatment . family history of epilepsy . The standardized mortality ratio (the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths) for patients with epilepsy is two to three times above that of the general population . In many cases, the cause of death is related to the underlying etiology, but sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is believed to account for up to 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths . SUDEP has been defined as 'sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, non-traumatic and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, with or without evidence of a seizure, and excluding documented status epilepticus, in which postmortem examination does not reveal toxicological or anatomic cause of death' . The reported incidence of SUDEP ranges from 0.35 to 10 per 1000 patients per year . It is higher if the seizure disorder remains uncontrolled, suggesting that the majority of SUDEP is related to seizure activity . Other associated causes of death include drowning, burns, aspiration, pneumonia, status epilepticus and suicide . 
Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) . conservative care and symptom control . dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis) . kidney transplant (from a living or cadaveric donor) . In general, all patients should be offered all suitable choices, and be fully counseled as to the advantages and disadvantages of each . In reality, however, not all options are available in all centers, and patient-related factors can be limiting . Conservative care . Dialysis may not improve quality of life in patients with extensive comorbidities . Indeed, there is some evidence that very elderly patients, with only limited comorbid illnesses, may not even have the length of their lives prolonged by dialysis . Such patients often have significantly better quality of life, fewer hospital admissions (exempli gratia from dialysis-related complications), and are more likely to die finally at home rather than in hospital than patients receiving dialysis . It is clearly important that patients participate fully in these discussions wherever possible . Changing the concentration of solutes in the dialysate can alter the electrolyte composition of the blood . Raising the dialysate calcium above the serum concentration, for example, can increase serum calcium in patients with hypocalcemia . The volume of water to be removed from the patient's blood can be controlled by altering the pressures on either side of the membrane separating the blood from the dialysate . Different modalities of dialysis differ in the precise balance of ultrafiltration and dialysis, the speed of blood flow and the nature of the dialysate . Patients need excellent vascular access, and access problems are a major cause of morbidity (Table 12.1) . Hemodialysis can be carried out in a main hospital center, a satellite unit (often staffed only by nurses) or in the patient's home . Home hemodialysis offers patients the most autonomy, but requires a suitable house with a water supply, space (for the machine and supplies), a reasonably technically competent patient and usually a trained helper who will be present during each dialysis session . Patients dialysing at home often have the best quality of life . Dialysis is usually performed three times each week for about 4 hours . Some patients opt for daily hemodialysis (usually 6 days/week), which provides the best control of fluid balance and biochemistry, but is intensive . Patients can dialyse overnight while they sleep either at home or in dialysis centers . It is difficult to determine the optimum amount of dialysis a patient requires, and various methods are in use . Dialysis and ultrafiltration occur across these capillaries . Ultrafiltration is controlled by altering the osmolality of the dialysate solution and thus drawing water out of the patient's blood . Dialysate is infused through a catheter, which is inserted into the patient's peritoneum under local or general anesthetic and remains in place permanently . Peritoneal dialysis is carried out by the patient at home, at work or while on holiday . It therefore allows the patient a high degree of independence and control over their own illness . However, patients must not be allowed to become isolated, and still need considerable support . In general, patients should begin dialysis when estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is in the range of 8-10 mL/minute/1.73m . There is no good evidence that starting dialysis earlier is of any benefit to patients . If dialysis is delayed for too long, however, patients can become very malnourished . Dialysis and pregnancy . Fertility often returns rapidly after a successful kidney transplant (see below) . A kidney transplant provides the best long-term outcome for patients with ESKD . All patients with ESKD should be considered for a transplant . Patients should be aware of the risks and benefits of transplantation (Table 12.4), and require screening for occult cardiovascular disease before surgery . Over 90% of transplants should be working 1 year after surgery . Patients do not generally have their native kidneys removed, and the transplanted kidney is placed extraperitoneally in the iliac fossa . Common complications . Most patients with a transplant will die from cardiovascular disease, which should, therefore, be aggressively managed . 
Social norms . Cigarette smoking is markedly influenced by social norms and other environmental influences . In cultures in which smoking is taboo for women, few women smoke . Smoking prevalence has declined as smoking has become more marginalized in sections of western society . The influence of social norms is also manifest in regional variations in smoking prevalence within countries . In the UK, for example, smoking prevalence increases with 'northerliness', even controlling for social class . Psychiatric disorders . There is a strong link between smoking and many psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, schizophrenia and substance abuse . Smoking is also prevalent among homeless people, many of whom suffer from mental health disorders . Not only are persons with psychiatric disorders more likely to smoke, but they are also likely to smoke more heavily than others . It has yet to be established why these links exist: whether smoking causes or exacerbates these conditions, whether a disorder makes it more likely that a patient will smoke and be unable to stop, or whether there is a common underlying cause . It is widely thought that smoking is particularly closely linked to schizophrenia, but in fact the dominant factors are the severity of the psychiatric disorder and whether the patient is institutionalized (Figure 3.1) . Thus, discussion about whether specific links exist between smoking behavior and the mechanisms that underlie schizophrenia or its treatment are somewhat premature . Alcohol intake and other drug-related disorders . Smokers are particularly likely to experience problems with illicit psychoactive drugs and alcohol . The link with alcohol abuse and alcoholism is particularly strong, leading some to suggest that heavy smokers should be screened for alcoholism . Similarly, although drug abuse is rare in an absolute sense, smokers, especially heavy smokers, are far more likely than non-smokers to engage in drug abuse . Smokers with alcohol use disorder find it harder to stop smoking; if they do stop, it does not adversely affect their prospects of recovery from that disorder, and may improve it . Adolescents who engage in antisocial behavior, truant from school and express antisocial attitudes are more likely to smoke than those who do not engage in antisocial behavior . In adulthood, there is a strong correlation between having a criminal conviction and being a smoker . Probably the greatest impact on smoking prevalence can be achieved through large-scale social and governmental policies . Table 3.1 summarizes the options and their likely effects . Taxation is the most clearly established of the many ways in which governments can influence smoking . A 10% increase in the price of cigarettes relative to earnings is linked, on average, to a 4% reduction in consumption by adults . In teenagers, the effect is greater, with a 10% increase in cost linked to a 10% decrease in consumption . In countries such as the UK, smokers support these kinds of policies, presumably because they recognize that they can provide an added incentive to stop - which is what they mostly want to do . Taxation has to be linked to effective countermeasures against illicit supply . It is important to structure it to prevent tobacco companies using pricing policies to undermine its deterrent effect . Not all of the decrease in consumption involves smokers giving up altogether; in some cases smokers merely reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke . The health benefits of this action may be undermined, however, because smokers tend to smoke each cigarette more intensively . It is also not fully known how reductions in consumption translate into health benefits . Nevertheless, it is clear that increasing the cost of smoking is, potentially, an important public health measure . Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence . The size of the effect is related to the intensity of the campaign (as indexed by viewing numbers) and whether it is sustained . Bans on tobacco advertising . Tobacco companies spend many billions of dollars annually promoting their brands . In many countries, including the USA, tobacco advertising is banned from television but is permitted in print media . Where there have been more comprehensive bans on promotion, there has been some evidence of an effect in reducing smoking . The effect is expected primarily to be on take-up of smoking - with cigarettes becoming less attractive to adolescents . Indoor smoking bans have been introduced in public indoor areas in many countries, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and in most jurisdictions in the USA . Although the bans were introduced to protect the health of non-smokers, there is some evidence that they might have at least a short-term effect in reducing smoking prevalence . 
Anorexia nervosa is characterized by the refusal to maintain a bodyweight equal to or above a minimally normal weight for the individual's age and height . Bodyweight is at least 15% below the norm . The weight loss is self-induced by several means . use of laxatives or diuretics . self-induced vomiting . Individuals with anorexia exhibit an overwhelming fear of putting on weight and a distorted view of the size and shape of their body . Postmenarcheal females experience amenorrhea, id est the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles, or if the menstrual cycle occurs it does so only as a result of hormone administration . There are two subtypes of anorexia . restricting type, in which the individual does not regularly engage in binge-eating or purging behavior . binge-eating/purging type, in which the individual regularly engages in binge-eating or purging behavior . Binge-eating is characterized by eating large amounts of food in a discrete amount of time and feeling a sense of a lack of control . Purging behavior includes self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas . The specific diagnostic criteria for anorexia from the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 - Diagnosis . Definition of bulimia nervosa . Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of significant binge-eating - eating large amounts of food in a discrete amount of time and feeling a sense of a lack of control - followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain . There are two subtypes of bulimia . purging type, in which the individual regularly engages in purging behavior, such as self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas . non-purging type, in which the individual does not regularly engage in purging behavior, but uses other inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as fasting or excessive exercising . Unlike anorexia, bulimia does not generally result in significant weight loss and in many ways is a very secretive disease . The shame and isolation experienced by individuals suffering from this disorder can hinder recovery . The specific DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for bulimia are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 - Diagnosis . Definition of eating disorders not otherwise specified . DSM-IV classifies both anorexia and bulimia under a specific diagnostic category entitled 'Eating Disorders', which also includes a third classification entitled 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' ('atypical eating disorder' in the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision [ICD-10]) . This last category includes binge-eating disorder and night-eating syndrome, discussed in Chapter 9 of this book, and may be used to describe eating disorders that meet some but not all of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia or bulimia: for example, an individual with almost all of the symptoms of anorexia but who still has a normal and regular menstrual cycle and/or a normal body mass index, or cases with overevaluation of weight and shape associated with purging behaviors at least twice a week but no binge-eating episodes ('eating disorder not otherwise specified' [EDNOS] purging type) . Patients that present with subsyndromal criteria should be monitored in order to identify the development of a full-syndrome eating disorder . Primary care physicians should conduct a comprehensive assessment to uncover any significant risk factors in the patient's life that could rapidly lead to a full-syndrome eating disorder . The primary care physician may invite the patient for serial assessments to track symptoms over time, consulting or referring with a specialist if needed . 
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy to affect men of middle age and beyond in most developed countries and, increasingly in developing countries, it is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths in men . The lifetime risk of developing clinical prostate cancer in western countries is about 1 in 8 . Approximately 80% of men aged 80 years have prostate cancer at autopsy . However, many of these cancers grow slowly and the risk of developing clinically detectable cancer is about 13%; the lifetime risk of actually dying from prostate cancer is approximately 3% . However, prostate cancer primarily affects men over the age of 50 years, so the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer is predicted to increase substantially over the next two decades as a result of the worldwide trend towards an aging population . Despite the high incidence of prostate cancer, relatively little is known about the underlying causes . Age is the greatest factor that influences the development of prostate cancer . Clinical disease is rare in men under the age of 50 years but the incidence increases markedly over 60 years of age . Marked geographic and racial variations are seen in the incidence of clinical prostate cancer (Table 1.2) . In the USA, the risk is higher in black men than in white men, and black men also appear to develop more aggressive disease earlier . The incidence of prostate cancer is lowest in Chinese and Japanese races, although the prevalence is now increasing in both . The incidence of latent (clinically insignificant) disease is similar in all populations studied . The incidence of prostate cancer in men who emigrate from a low- to a high-risk area increases to that of the local population within two generations . This suggests that environmental influences such as diet and lifestyle factors may have a profound effect on the development of prostate cancer and on the progression of latent to clinically detectable cancer . Family history/genetic risk . Epidemiology studies show that heritable factors account for a small proportion of prostate cancer risk but a higher proportion of early-onset disease . However, a host of studies have suggested the existence of prostate cancer susceptibility genes . Family history is a strong risk factor for prostate cancer: the risk of a man developing prostate cancer is increased approximately 2.5-fold if he has a first-degree relative who is affected . The relative risks for developing prostate cancer based on family history are shown in Table 1.3 . The high incidence of familial prostate cancer prompted a search for germline mutations . Early linkage analyses suggested the human prostate cancer 1 gene (HPC1) located at 1q24-25, and studies in men with familial prostate cancer but without male to male transmission led to the identification of the X-linked human prostate cancer X gene (HPCX) at Xq27-28 . The strongest evidence for direct causality comes from families who develop cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome - the risk of developing prostate cancer is elevated twofold for those carrying the abnormal gene . However, the incidence of prostate cancer increases with age, while serum testosterone levels decrease . In addition, men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer often have a lower average testosterone level than men of a similar age who do not have prostate cancer . Early studies showed an increased risk of prostate cancer in obese men whereas more recent studies indicate that levels of detected prostate cancer are in fact lower in obese men . This may be because they have lower levels of PSA and androgens, such that fewer obese men underwent biopsy and were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the PSA era . A recently published study on risk factors for prostate cancer reported that being obese was associated with a 44% increase in the risk of prostate cancer diagnosis . Prostate cancer mortality is significantly higher in men who are obese . A number of studies support links between the intake of saturated fat and red and processed meats in particular and the development of prostate cancer . Omega-3 fatty acids from marine sources may, however, decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer . The risk of dying from prostate cancer is related geographically to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and men with prostate cancer have lower levels of vitamin D . Most prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas . However, these microscopic tumors often grow very slowly, and many never progress to clinical disease . The Gleason grading system is widely used for grading prostate cancer (Figure 1.4) . Patterns of disease spread . The tumor stage (T1-T4) describes the pathological development of the tumor . T4 represents advanced disease, where the tumor has invaded neighboring organs (Figure 1.6) . 
The most common complaints are of a weakness in one arm or leg, or a change in the voice . Individuals are often able to date the onset of symptoms to a specific month . Occasionally, an individual with ALS will perceive that the initial symptom came on overnight . More rarely, an individual with ALS will report transient remission of weakness . Individual symptoms depend on the region affected and the relative burden of upper and lower motor neuron disease . More unusual presentations of ALS include respiratory-onset disease, with weight loss and orthopnea, and cognitive or behavioral change . Limb symptoms . Most people with ALS first develop symptoms in the limbs . This is called spinal-onset ALS . Individuals with ALS may report a weak limb, hand or foot as 'dead' despite normal sensation, so it is important to clarify such language . Lower limb symptoms . LMN disease in the legs presents as weakness, most commonly starting in the ankle dorsiflexors . Upper limb symptoms . They are often worse after prolonged exercise . Those with ALS also have frequent, disabling cramps . However, in the presence of progressive muscular weakness it is a common and important sign in ALS (see Case report 3.1) . Fasciculation without weakness, especially in someone under the age of 40, is rarely due to ALS, but muscle weakness is always pathological . Bulbar symptoms . Bulbar symptoms initially comprise changes in speech and, later, problems with swallowing . In lower motor neuron bulbar disease, the dysarthria usually involves slurring; individuals may report that they 'sound as if [they] have been drinking' . A less obvious but frequently encountered UMN bulbar symptom is pseudobulbar affect (PBA) . Excessive yawning is a frequently concurrent symptom . Weakness may be an LMN sign or a UMN sign . LMN weakness often has associated atrophy . Individuals with ALS usually do not report fasciculation (unlike those with benign fasciculation) . Muscle tone is reduced in LMN disease . This is not commonly a useful sign, as it only becomes apparent when weakness is advanced . Repetitive movements are slowed in UMN disease . Lower motor neuron weakness in a limb characteristically affects muscles supplied by more than one peripheral nerve or nerve root . Proximal weakness in the arms may result in weakness of shoulder abduction or of flexion and extension at the elbow . When onset is in the leg, the ankle dorsiflexors are often involved early . The eyes should have a full range of movement in all but very advanced cases of ALS . Neck flexion and extension is an important test; a degree of weakness in one or both directions is a common finding in ALS . Upper motor neuron weakness typically affects a limb in a pyramidal pattern . Sensation is normal in ALS . Less common presentations . Respiratory-onset ALS . Signs of respiratory insufficiency (Table 3.3) should be sought whenever a diagnosis of ALS is suspected . Rarely, they are the presenting symptoms (approximately 3% of ALS cases are 'respiratory onset') . Weight loss is a key symptom and may be prominent (Case report 3.3) . In respiratory-onset ALS, it is predominantly due to the increased caloric demand from the sheer work of breathing . It is therefore important to be alert to ALS as a possible underlying cause and to examine the individual carefully for signs of motor neuron involvement (see Case report 3.3) . Individuals with respiratory-onset ALS often have associated weakness of their axial muscles . Chest wall fasciculation is often pronounced but asymptomatic and only recognized if the individual is undressed . ALS-FTD presentation . It was previously thought that cognition was unaffected in ALS . When FTD is the presenting feature of ALS, motor features are often recognized soon after the cognitive or behavioral changes . Primary lateral sclerosis presentation . Weakness is far less prominent a symptom than in typical ALS . The symptoms most commonly start in the legs . In a minority with an initial bulbar presentation, common symptoms include a strained or forced voice and marked emotional lability . Distinguishing PLS from UMN-predominant ALS is challenging (see Chapter 4) . 
Diabetic pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome for the fetus, but there is little excess mortality among diabetic women . Pregnancy may be complicated by type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and, increasingly, by type 2 diabetes . Occasionally, both types 1 and 2 may be diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy . Of all pregnancies in the USA, 3-10% are complicated by diabetes (90% are cases of GDM) . The fetal morbidity associated with diabetes is shown in Table 12.1 . There is a miscarriage rate of 9-14% among women with pre-existing diabetes . The congenital malformation rate in diabetic pregnancy is 5.1-9.8% . Diabetic pregnancy is linked with the development of large-for-gestational-age babies, but growth restriction in patients with pre-existing type 1 diabetes may also occur, particularly when the diabetes is associated with vascular complications . Fetal macrosomia (affecting 15-45% of babies born to diabetic women) is a frequent complication of diabetic pregnancy and increases the likelihood of birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus trauma . Perinatal mortality has fallen greatly in diabetic pregnancies but remains approximately twice that observed in non-diabetic pregnancies, with serious congenital malformations accounting for a large proportion of fetal loss . Management of a diabetic pregnancy . The management of existing diabetes must start in the preconception period . Women should take folic acid, 5 mg daily, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects . After conception women should be seen as soon as possible in a combined diabetic/obstetric clinic with access to a dedicated diabetes physician, obstetrician, diabetes specialist nurse, dietitian and midwife . Blood glucose levels should be checked in the fasting state and 1 hour after each meal . Metformin can be continued throughout the pregnancy by a woman with type 2 diabetes, though most women will require additional insulin . Women with type 1 diabetes should be advised of an increased risk of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness in the first trimester . Insulin-treated women are best managed by an insulin pump regimen during labor or Cesarean section . Effect on complications . Pregnancy may be hazardous to women with pre-existing complications of diabetes . A successful outcome of pregnancy is unlikely when the serum creatinine exceeds 250 µmol/L . Hypertension and pre-eclampsia are more common in diabetic mothers . Gestational diabetes mellitus . GDM is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy . Previously there were no uniformly accepted international standards for the diagnosis of GDM . The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has attempted to achieve an international consensus on screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes . It recommends a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all women who are not known to be diabetic at 24-28 weeks . Gestational diabetes is diagnosed when one or more threshold values are exceeded (fasting >= 5.1 mmol/L [92 mg/dL), 1-hour >= 10.0 mmol/L [180 mg/dL], 2-hour >= 8.5 mmol/L [153 mg/dL]) . Women should be screened for risk factors at booking . For high-risk women, a one-step approach could be used by proceeding directly to the 100 g 3-hour OGTT . However, at present, the American Diabetes Association is planning to consider adoption of the IADPSG diagnostic criteria . The risks associated with GDM are listed in Table 12.2 . Weight loss is recommended for women with a body mass index (BMI) above 27 kg/m . Pharmacological treatment is recommended when fasting blood glucose values exceed 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or 2-hour postprandial glucose values exceed 6.7 mmol/L (120 mg/dL) . Recent evidence suggests that glibenclamide may also be useful in the treatment of GDM . Advising women . Women with GDM need to be informed that the condition confers an increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes and should be strongly advised to reduce this risk postnatally by reducing weight and taking regular exercise . Babies born to diabetic mothers are at increased risk of developing obesity and diabetes . 
In the context of cancer, the term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic targets . Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science . What types of tumor are potentially susceptible to immuno-oncology? . Potential targets for cancer immunotherapy . A variety of cancer immunotherapy strategies are currently being investigated, or have already entered clinical practice . Passive immunotherapies . Tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically target malignant cells are among the best characterized forms of cancer immunotherapy . inhibition of signaling pathways in tumor cells . opsonization of tumor cells and activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent phagocytosis and complement-mediated cytotoxicity . CAR-T therapy . Such T cells are genetically modified to express a transmembrane protein consisting of a synthetic T-cell receptor that targets a predetermined antigen expressed by the tumor . Following infusion of these cells, the patient's immune system actively surveys and engages specific cancer cells that express the antigen . Promising clinical trial results have been achieved with this approach in patients with CD19-positive B-cell hematologic malignancies . Oncolytic viruses are non-pathogenic viruses that specifically infect cancer cells . Such viruses may kill cancer cells in two ways . an innate cytopathic effect resulting from overloaded cell metabolism in response to viral infection . Clinical trials of T-VEC are ongoing for a variety of cancers, either alone or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors . Active immunotherapies . Preventative antiviral vaccines . These relationships also create the potential for antiviral vaccines to be used to prevent cancer . Therapeutic vaccines . Dendritic cell-based immunotherapies . There is currently no consensus on the optimal approach to dendritic cell-based immunotherapy . Peptide- and DNA-based vaccines . Anticancer vaccines could potentially be either peptide-based or DNA-based . Similarly, no DNA-based vaccine has yet been shown to be beneficial in clinical trials . Whole-cell tumor vaccines are another potential anticancer vaccination . The attenuated tumor cells are then combined with an appropriate adjuvant and injected back into the patient, triggering an immune response . Whole-cell vaccines have the advantage that the patient is exposed to the full range of TAAs expressed in the tumor, whereas protein-based or DNA-based vaccines involve only a limited number of antigens . Oncophage is an autologous HSP vaccine that reached Phase III trials in melanoma and renal cell cancer but the data were inconsistent . Cytokine antibodies and targeted agents . It is also important in regulating T helper cell function . In cancer, IL-6 is also important in . differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) . regulation of self-renewal of cancer stem cells . the development of cancer cachexia syndrome . Therapeutic antibodies to IL-6 have also been trialed in cancer patients, including studies in the management of cancer cachexia syndrome . Other cancer therapies target the JAK/STAT signaling pathway . A number of PRR agonists have been approved for use in cancer patients, including . The anticancer effects of BCG result from the recruitment and activation of immune cells, including CD4+ T cells, which eliminate cancer cells that have internalized BCG . Inducers of immunogenic cell death . Assessing the benefits and risks of immunotherapy in cancer . Response to immunotherapies may vary markedly between patients: while some patients may show an initial response or stable disease, in others the response may be delayed because of the need to restore T-cell responses - a process that requires the interaction of numerous other immune cells . response after an initial increase in tumor burden . Combining different immunotherapies . Combining immunotherapy with targeted therapies . Combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy . Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy . Although this effect is not sufficient to overcome immune tolerance in cancer cells, the combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy may be beneficial . 
Patients with mild acute pancreatitis (AP) (65% of cases) have an uneventful disease course, with initial severe pain that improves quickly . In general terms, these patients are easily managed . In contrast, patients with moderate-to-severe AP may be challenging: they may require aggressive fluid resuscitation and they have prolonged pain and sometimes intolerance to oral refeeding . These patients may develop organ failure (OF) and be prone to late complications . This chapter addresses the early management of AP, focusing on the evidence underpinning each intervention . Virtually all patients without OF will survive, but OF (especially when persistent or multiple) is associated with an increased risk of mortality . For this reason, monitoring patients to enable early detection of OF is particularly important . In general terms, likely causes of OF in AP include the following . Respiratory failure is the most frequent form of OF associated with AP . Urine output is especially important for the early detection of renal failure and patients in need of aggressive fluid resuscitation . There is no specific treatment for OF in AP . With no effective pharmacological therapies for treating AP, early management currently relies on supportive care . Fluid resuscitation is considered a cornerstone in the management of AP because patients have several factors that tend to decrease intravascular volume . Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting in the early phase affect a patient's ability to tolerate oral nutrition . Each patient therefore has different fluid requirements . Hypovolemia and fluid sequestration are associated with the severity of AP, so patients with mild disease may have little or no fluid sequestration, but local and systemic complications (which define moderate-to-severe AP) are closely linked to it . In 1998, a case-control study compared hematocrit among patients with necrotizing versus mild AP . The authors suggested that hemoconcentration was the cause of pancreatic necrosis through impaired pancreatic blood flow and recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation to improve outcomes in all patients with AP . In both trials, the more aggressive approach was associated with worse outcomes, including decreased survival . These studies suggested that vigorous resuscitation is dangerous in patients with severe AP . Currently, it is clear that fluid volumes and rates need to be tailored to individual patient requirements . Fluid type . However, both studies included a small number of patients, and the influence of lactated Ringer's solution on important outcomes such as OF or mortality is unknown . Opioids are widely used for the management of pain in AP . As there are only a few studies, involving small samples of patients, comparing NSAIDs with other drugs or placebo, a higher incidence of adverse events has not been demonstrated in AP . Therefore, at present, NSAIDs seem safe for use in AP, at least in stable patients without renal impairment and no history of peptic ulcers . However, specific studies are lacking . Epidural analgesia is an option for managing refractory pain and in patients with severe disease . Almost all patients with AP initially suffer abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and in most cases of mild AP these symptoms are the only impediments to oral refeeding . Paralytic ileus may be present in some patients, but it usually resolves in 24-48 hours . Local complications may be associated with early satiety and/or gastric outlet obstruction in a small proportion of patients . Moderate-to-severe AP seems associated with hypermetabolism and negative nitrogen balance with negative energy balance . Patients with persistent OF are usually sedated, so oral refeeding is not possible . Therefore, oral refeeding in patients with mild AP should be initiated after pain has resolved . Nutrition in moderate-to-severe disease . As a consequence, parenteral nutrition was considered a standard of care in patients with predicted severe disease . In the 1990s, several RCTs compared nasojejunal tube-based enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition in patients with predicted severe AP . The study showed that on-demand oral feeding was not associated with worse outcomes, and only 31% of patients needed a nasojejunal tube . The nasojejunal route is indicated in patients with gastric outlet obstruction . Patients with AP and acute cholangitis may benefit from early ERCP, as the first studies (those showing better outcomes for early ERCP) included patients with this complication . 
Starting treatment . Several questions need to be addressed when deciding whether to prescribe an antiepileptic drug (AED) to a patient presenting after one or more seizures . What are the potential negative consequences on the patient's life if seizures recur? . What are the potential adverse effects of treatment? . After a single seizure . Whether treatment should be started after a single episode remains controversial . As a substantial proportion of such patients will not have further episodes, most specialists do not routinely recommend treatment after a single seizure . After more than one seizure . Generally speaking, patients reporting more than one well-documented or witnessed seizure require treatment . Pushing the issue if there is doubt about the diagnosis, particularly if the patient resists the introduction of AED therapy, may be counterproductive . Ideally, the patient and their immediate family should be encouraged to make an informed commitment to the treatment plan . That this particular risk has been touched upon should be documented in the patient's case notes . Principles of drug selection . The goal of treatment should be to enable the patient to lead as normal a lifestyle as possible, which generally requires complete seizure control without, or with minimal, side effects . Choosing the most suitable AED for an individual patient requires knowledge of the characteristics of the epilepsy, the patient and the available AEDs . The chance of remission is highest with the first drug - 60% of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve seizure control with the first or second AED . AED effectiveness is a function of efficacy and tolerability . Approximately 50% of newly diagnosed patients will be able to tolerate and become seizure free with the first AED, often in low or moderate doses . If the first AED produces an idiosyncratic reaction or side effects at low or moderate doses, or fails to improve seizure control an alternative drug should be substituted . Matching treatment to seizure type . The profile of activity against different seizure types differs among the AEDs (Tables 4.1 and 4.2) . It is therefore of paramount importance to classify the patient's seizure type(s) and epilepsy syndrome accurately (see Chapter 2) . Recommended drug choices for adults and children according to seizure types are shown in Tables 4.3 and 4.4, respectively . Side effects . The drug should be avoided if the patient is a carrier of this allele . Drug labeling has been amended by manufacturers accordingly . AEDs can also be targets for drugs other than AEDs that induce or inhibit hepatic metabolism . As well as controlling seizures, some AEDs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of other conditions that may coexist with epilepsy (Table 4.7) . prolonged AED therapy . exposure to multiple drugs . Nonetheless, clinicians should monitor patients closely for suicidal ideation when starting or increasing doses of AEDs . Combination therapy reduces seizure frequency or severity in some patients . Practical guidelines for prescribing AEDs are summarized in Table 4.9 . Drug-resistant epilepsy . accuracy of the seizure and/or syndrome classification . compliance with medication . If the first AED combination is ineffective and epilepsy surgery is not an option, a sequence of drug combinations with potential complementary modes of action could be tried . A small proportion of patients will become seizure free with three AEDs, but treatment with four or more is highly unlikely to be tolerated and therefore successful . Eventually, many patients can have their medication withdrawn and remain in remission . Some patients do not equate taking medication with normal health . Several studies have shown that after a long period of perfect seizure control, medication can be stopped without seizure recurrence (for several years at least) in around 60% of patients . In children, 2 years of seizure freedom is reasonable before considering AED withdrawal . Seizure type or epilepsy syndrome is not absolutely predictive of recurrence . relatively few seizures before and after starting AED therapy . treatment with a single AED . If the patient is taking two AEDs, one drug should be slowly withdrawn before the second is tapered . The primary goal of epilepsy management is to restore the patient's functional capacity to its maximal potential . The patient should be referred back to the epilepsy specialist if . seizures are unresponsive to the first two AED schedules . treatment causes significant side effects . he or she is considering stopping therapy . 
low-dose aspirin should be considered unless contraindicated . Aims of treatment . Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is characterized by vascular features, including both thrombosis and paradoxical bleeding . Given this risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage, a key aim in the treatment of ET is to prevent blood clotting and bleeding; however, it is also important to alleviate any problematic symptoms . Stratification of treatment according to risk . As described in Chapter 3, the risk of thrombosis in ET is assessed on the basis of age and previous history of thrombosis . Thus, a patient below the age of 60 years with no previous history of thrombosis would be considered at low risk of vascular complications, whereas an older patient or one with previous thrombosis is considered to be at high risk . The choice of treatment depends on the patient's risk level . Low-risk patients with JAK2 mutations, or cardiovascular risk factors in the absence of JAK2 mutations, should perhaps be treated with aspirin . As a general principle, all high-risk patients should be treated with aspirin (unless contraindicated) and cytoreductive therapy to reduce the platelet count . Management of low-risk patients . Treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, and promotion of a generally healthy lifestyle, may be sufficient intervention for very-low-risk patients . Smoking cessation should be actively promoted because cigarette smoking has been shown to be an independent risk factor for thrombosis in patients with ET . There is also evidence that antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of venous thrombosis in patients with JAK2 V617F mutations and cardiovascular risk factors (arterial thrombosis) . Higher doses of aspirin (up to 500 mg daily) may be required in patients with acute erythromelalgia . Cytoreductive therapy does not reduce the risk of thrombosis compared with observation alone in low-risk patients with ET, and recent data from the PT-1 study have shown that early cytoreductive therapy does not reduce mortality from thrombotic events . Management of high-risk patients . First-line treatment . Cytoreductive treatment reduces the rate of vascular complications in high-risk patients but it is not possible to identify a specific threshold platelet count that confers optimal protection against such complications . Hydroxyurea should be considered as first-line therapy, aiming to achieve a normal platelet count . For example, in a recent Phase II study of pegylated IFN-alpha-2a, 22% of patients with ET or PV discontinued treatment because of adverse events . Second-line treatment . Anagrelide, IFN-alpha or busulfan may be considered for second-line treatment if the platelet count is uncontrolled with hydroxyurea . Furthermore, compared with hydroxyurea, anagrelide was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological and constitutional adverse events . A further study (ANHYDRET) showed non-inferiority of anagrelide compared with hydroxyurea in 259 high-risk patients with ET (World Health Organization criteria) . These studies highlight a risk of bleeding when anagrelide is combined with aspirin . Busulfan remains a useful treatment but is often restricted to patients with limited life expectancy because of the increased risk of acute leukemia when used after hydroxyurea . Aspirin should be used with caution because of the increased risk of bleeding . Note that extreme thrombocytosis has not, in itself, been shown to constitute a high risk in patients with ET, and the use of cytoreductive therapy does not affect the risk of bleeding or microvascular complications in young (< 40 years) asymptomatic patients with extreme thrombocytosis . A platelet count above 15 000 x 10 /L is regarded as an indication for treatment . Recognizing treatment failure . Since the treatment of ET aims primarily to reduce the risk of thrombosis and bleeding, response criteria have traditionally focused on platelet count . Response criteria cannot be defined in low-risk patients treated with aspirin, whereas the aim of treatment in higher-risk patients receiving cytoreductive therapy is to reduce platelet counts to below 400-450 x 10 /L . It is important to recognize developing resistance to standard therapy - hydroxyurea in particular - because of an increased risk of disease transformation . 
Effect on development of prostate cancer . Diet and lifestyle are clearly linked to the development of prostate cancer . The effects of obesity and a western-style diet as risk factors for the development of prostate cancer were mentioned in Chapter 1 . A large number of studies have evaluated the effects of dietary manipulation/supplementation in reducing the incidence of prostate cancer; the current evidence is summarized in Table 2.1 . Although randomized clinical trials have provided some indication that selenium and vitamin E have a protective effect, a large chemoprevention study (the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]), designed to determine whether they reduced the likelihood of prostate cancer when used singly or in combination, was ended prematurely because of disappointingly negative results . Cohort studies show that lycopene (in tomatoes) and isoflavonoids (found in soy products) may be associated with a decrease in the incidence of prostate cancer . Evidence for other dietary supplements is weak . A recently published but slightly dubious cohort study on risk factors for prostate cancer reported that having more than seven sexual partners increased the risk by 100%, and having more than five orgasms per month increased the risk by 59% . However, there is no evidence that reducing these factors reverses the risk! . Chemoprevention refers to the use of drugs to reduce the risk of cancer . The 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride has been shown to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer by 24.8% compared with placebo over a 7-year period, although at the cost of a small but significant increase in sexual side effects . However, this is counterbalanced by the finding that a small proportion of cancers in the finasteride group tended to be more aggressive than those in the placebo group, although this may have been an artifact of taking biopsies from the smaller prostates in the active treatment arm resulting from the shrinkage effect of finasteride . A 2013 study reported that there was no difference in the overall survival (OS) rate, or survival after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, between the placebo-treated and finasteride-treated patients after 18 years of follow-up . Another 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, has been evaluated for its effect on the occurrence of prostate cancer in the REDUCE study (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) . Dutasteride resulted in a 23% reduction in the development of prostate cancer, mainly by suppressing the well-differentiated cancers, with only a slight (statistically insignificant) increase in Gleason pattern 7 or 8-10 poorly differentiated tumors . It also effectively treated the symptoms arising from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) . Neither of these compounds were approved by the regulatory authorities for chemoprevention . Statins have also been reported to have some chemopreventative properties although the evidence is weak and conflicting: a recent review found that only eight of 43 studies reported a positive association between statin use and a reduction in the development or progression of prostate cancer . Effect on progression . Very few trials have investigated the effect of diet and lifestyle change on prostate cancer progression . Table 2.2 outlines the current body of evidence . It must be remembered that cardiovascular disease is still the primary cause of death in men, with or without prostate cancer, and heart-healthy lifestyle choices will reduce mortality in men with prostate cancer . These include improving lipid profiles, decreasing obesity and increasing physical fitness . A healthy diet and regular vigorous exercise may help protect the individual against various forms of cancer, in addition to decreasing the risk of death from cardiovascular causes . Evidence for a beneficial effect of exercise on prostate cancer-specific mortality is also increasing, and post-diagnosis recreational activity has been shown to significantly lower prostate cancer-specific mortality . The mechanism many not be merely related to decreased sedentary activity, however, as there was no association between sedentary activity and increased mortality . 
The biliary and pancreatic ducts . The main pancreatic duct joins the bile duct to form the common channel or ampulla of Vater (also known as the major papilla) . In 90% of people, the embryonic dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts are fused to form this pancreatic duct, meeting in the head of the pancreas . Small sphincters around the ends of the main bile and pancreatic ducts control the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, respectively; the sphincter of Oddi controls the outflow from the ampulla of Vater . The gallbladder is tucked under the right liver lobe in the gallbladder fossa and is connected via the cystic duct to the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct . Bile acids, essential for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, are made in the liver and travel in canaliculi to reach the bile ducts . The intrahepatic bile ducts drain into the right and left hepatic ducts, which fuse to form the common hepatic duct . Epidemiology of biliary tract disease . They may cause acute biliary colic, acute cholecystitis or chronic cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis or cholangitis . Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and the most common GI cancer in Native Americans . Incidence and mortality are very high in certain Latin American countries, especially Chile . Of the most commonly seen GI cancers in the USA, Europe and Australia, gallbladder cancer is the least common compared with other parts of the world . In most EU countries (with similar trends in the USA and Australia), mortality rates for gallbladder cancer have declined by approximately 30% among women and 10% among men, but mortality is still high in central and eastern Europe . Bile duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, may arise in the intra- or the extrahepatic biliary system, usually in people between 50 and 70 years of age . Sclerosing cholangitis affecting the biliary system may occur in association with diseases such as ulcerative colitis and in secondary form due to conditions such as AIDS . The gallbladder and the biliary system may also be affected by dyskinetic conditions such as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and gallbladder dyskinesia . The pancreas . The pancreas is the shape of a small flat fish, 6-8 inches long and salmon pink in color . The pancreas is important for the production of . bicarbonate - from the duct cells (to neutralize gastric acid) . Epidemiology of pancreatic disease . In the year 2000 there were 1.15 million patients with non-malignant pancreatic disease in the USA . Each year 125 000 North Americans present with acute pancreatitis, 100 000 present with chronic pancreatitis and at least 45 000 die from diseases of the pancreas . Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal cancer and ranks fourth among cancer-related deaths in the USA . It is estimated that about 48 960 people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and about 40 560 people will die of pancreatic cancer in 2015 in the USA . In a study of a well-defined German population, the incidence rates for acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer per 100 000 inhabitants/year were found to be 19.7, 6.4 and 7.8 respectively . For acute pancreatitis, the highest incidence rates are in the USA and Finland . The incidence rate in Finland is 73.4 cases per 100 000 people . Similar incidence rates have been reported for Australia . 
Several specific issues arise in the assessment of older brain tumor patients (Table 12.1) . The number of patients taking multiple (five or more) medications is highest among those aged 65 and older . Nutritional status is often poor in the elderly and may merit assessment . Social considerations such as marital status, income and housing are equally important and have been shown to influence treatment decisions in older cancer patients . Glioblastoma occurs most often in people 65-84 years of age . Several studies have shown that the likelihood of receiving surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy decreases with age; however, older patients with glioblastoma can benefit from combination therapy . Surgical resection of glioblastoma may extend survival and improve quality of life in older patients who are in good health . Radiotherapy extends survival over best supportive care in older patients with glioblastoma . It may be reasonable to use a modified radiotherapy regimen in some older patients . Several studies suggest that a shortened course of radiotherapy delivered over 2-3 weeks has efficacy similar to that of the standard 6-week regimen and this may have practical benefits for some patients . Temozolomide is currently approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma and is started during radiotherapy . The trial leading to approval of temozolomide excluded patients over the age of 70 . However, several studies have now shown that temozolomide is effective in older patients both in terms of tumor response and extended survival . However, there may be an increase in acute toxicity in older patients . Also, older patients receiving temozolomide during radiotherapy may have treatment-induced neurological decline . Several studies suggest that this drug may be particularly effective in older glioblastoma patients and merits further study . However, in the elderly patient, concern is often raised about the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate . Delayed neurotoxicity has been described as a consequence of whole-body radiotherapy following high-dose methotrexate, particularly in older patients, which raises a concern about appropriate use in the elderly . The major limiting toxicity of high-dose methotrexate is renal toxicity . Several studies have specifically looked at delivering high-dose methotrexate to elderly patients with PCNSL (Table 12.2) . Radiographic response rates of 90% or higher have been described and one study showed no difference in acute toxicity associated with methotrexate in older patients . Elderly patients with PCNSL treated with whole-body radiotherapy as consolidation following methotrexate have a significant risk of delayed neurotoxicity - estimated to be as high as 90% . Most patients require assistance with activities of daily living and have a poor quality of life . There is no effective therapy for this syndrome . Recognition of the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate and treatment-related neurotoxicity has led to the recommendation that whole-body radiotherapy should be avoided for elderly patients, and that methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone should be used as standard treatment . Results from specific studies of the elderly are not available to guide treatment for most other brain tumors . Older patients who are healthy with limited comorbidities and full function should be offered the standard of care . Those patients with moderate comorbidities and/or limited independence should be considered for standard treatment with possible modifications to limit side effects . Those elderly patients who are truly frail (multiple comorbidities, complete dependence or a severe geriatric syndrome such as dementia) are most appropriately offered best supportive care . Population studies suggest that increasing age is often associated with decreasing treatment . While this may be appropriate for some elderly patients, other patients over the age of 65 remain in excellent health with a good quality of life and the potential to respond to appropriate treatment . In an elderly patient the differential diagnosis for this clinical presentation is lengthy, ranging from dementia and depression to cerebrovascular disease . Recent advances in the management of brain tumors raise a number of issues for older patients . First, older patients are often underrepresented in those clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of a new therapy and thus it is not known if the same benefit can be expected in the geriatric population . Further, the acute toxicity profile associated with a new therapy may be different in the elderly . Finally, the assessment of long-term toxicity associated with new therapies is often limited at the time of initial development and may present differently in older patients . 
Mixed anxiety and depressive disorder . Adjustment disorder . Bipolar disorder . An important distinction is made between 'unipolar' forms of depression, such as major depression and persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar depression, which is the form of depression found among individuals who have had an episode of hypomania or mania . In DSM-5, bipolar disorder is considered in a separate chapter from the depressive disorders . Frequently, an episode of depression is the first 'mood' episode for individuals with bipolar disorder and so the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is not made and will only become manifest when an episode of (hypo)mania arises . The time between the first mood episode and the diagnosis of bipolar disorder can be up to 7 years . The treatment of bipolar depression is different from that of major depression . Depressive episodes are a common part of this condition but are not regarded as essential for diagnosis within this classification . In the DSM-5 classification system, there are two disorder types: bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder . Bipolar I disorder involves the occurrence of one or more manic episodes or mixed episodes - involving a combination of the features of mania and depressive disorder - nearly every day, lasting for at least 1 week . Although individuals will often also have had one or more major depressive episodes, these are not necessary for a diagnosis . Additionally, at least one major depressive episode must have been experienced . Problems defining depression . Diagnosis is based on the symptom profile and the severity, duration and course of the disorder . Clinical depression is a heterogeneous disorder, with some forms having clear biological underpinnings whereas others arise from psychosocial adversity . There are then fundamental problems in the notion of depression as a psychiatric disorder . Defining the boundaries of depression . The validity of the concept of depression is questioned on a number of counts . Depression, like most psychiatric disorders, is defined by its symptom profile . Delineating depression from other mental disorders . The benefit of defining depression . The cluster of symptoms experienced in depression is central to its classification as a mental health disorder . The number, intensity and effects of these symptoms are central to differentiating depression from normal experiences and from other disorders . There is a consensus concerning the symptoms of depression . In DSM-5 the depressive disorders are separated from the bipolar disorders, even though episodes of depression are common to both . Depression arising in individuals with bipolar disorder is referred to as 'bipolar depression' and its treatment is different from the treatment for 'unipolar' major depression . Major depressive disorder . In the DSM-5 classification, the central condition of 'depression' is 'major depressive disorder', which is experienced as a single or recurrent episode . Within ICD-10, it is simply called 'depressive episode' or 'recurrent depressive episode' . The terms 'clinical depression' and 'unipolar depression' are also often used . Single episode or recurrent . Each episode of depression increases the risks for additional episodes, with a 70% risk of relapse following two episodes and a 90% risk after three . People with a history of depression have been found to have, on average, between five and nine further episodes during their lifetime . As well as specifying whether depressive disorder is a single episode, recurrent or persistent, the severity of the current episode is an important clinical descriptor . Psychotic features . The experience of abnormal perceptions (hallucinations) or beliefs (delusions) may be part of the presentation in a severe episode of depressive disorder . Melancholic features . Melancholia used to be known as 'endogenous' depression . depression worse in the morning . Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) occurs when depression recurrences follow a seasonal pattern . depressive episodes occur repeatedly at a particular time of the year . seasonal depressive episodes outnumber other depressive episodes during the individual's lifetime . Perinatal or peripartum depression is a term that encompasses depression during pregnancy as well as following delivery . It is not considered a separate mood disorder from major depression: its symptoms are no different from depression symptoms arising at other times in life . Persistent depressive disorder . Persistent depressive disorder has replaced the terms 'dysthymia' and 'chronic major depression' in DSM-5 . It is a chronic and unremitting form experienced by 10-20% of people with depression . 
Many patients will, however, live without a significant burden of symptomatic diabetes complications . Neuropathy in diabetes is common and may have many and varied manifestations . The types of neuropathy seen in diabetic patients are set out in Table 9.2 . Fortunately it is rare, with an overall prevalence of around 0.08% in patients with diabetes . Diabetic mononeuropathy . Neuropathies affecting single nerves or their roots are common in diabetes . Diabetic autonomic neuropathy . Table 9.3 lists how autonomic neuropathy may affect the diabetic patient . Diabetic constipation is also seen . of diabetic autonomic neuropathy usually proves to be a challenge . The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes . The majority (80-90%) of patients show some degree of retinopathy after 20 years of diabetes . Diabetes is the most common cause of blindness in people aged 20-60 years in western countries . All patients with diabetes must be screened at least annually for the presence of diabetic retinopathy . Intraocular steroids are also used to treat diabetic macular edema . Other therapies . The prognosis of diabetic patients receiving hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory dialysis has improved greatly in recent years, but it is still worse than for non-diabetic patients . The diabetic foot . The development of a foot ulcer is a very dangerous complication of diabetes . Unfortunately, foot ulceration occurs relatively commonly in people with diabetes . Around 15% of patients with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer, and this has enormous associated healthcare costs . Up to 25% of all diabetic hospital admissions in the USA and UK are attributable to foot ulcers . Adherence to preventive protocols for diabetic footcare can prevent this dire complication of diabetes of which patients know and fear greatly (Table 9.7) . Ischemic ulcers can also occur in diabetic patients, but with a much lower frequency than neuropathic ulcers . Treatment of diabetic foot ulcers lacks an evidence base . More than 60% of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations occur in people with diabetes . Diabetic patients, particularly women, have an increased risk of dying from coronary artery disease and an increased mortality from peripheral vascular disease . Of all lower-limb amputations, 50% are performed on diabetic patients . Atherosclerosis is more severe and widespread in diabetic patients, and consequently coronary artery disease may present at a younger age than in the non-diabetic population . Diabetic patients have more multivessel disease of the coronary arteries . The detection and treatment of hypertension is a vital part of overall diabetes care . Hypertension is common in people with diabetes, affecting 10-30% of white patients with type 1 diabetes and 60% of all patients with type 2 diabetes . In NHANES III, 71% of diabetic patients were found to have hypertension . Hypertension in diabetes substantially increases the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular disease . This study also showed that in people with diabetes, blood pressure needed to be lowered further than in those without diabetes to achieve equivalent benefit on mortality . Most hypertensive diabetic patients will require multiple drug therapy to reach the recommended targets outlined above . Failure of erection is a common complication of diabetes in men (see Fast Facts: Erectile Dysfunction) . Erectile dysfunction is now viewed, in most cases, as a vascular complication of diabetes . Other diabetic complications . Many skin conditions are associated with diabetes; these include necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum, diabetic dermopathy and diabetic bullae . Dupuytren's contracture and adhesive capsulitis are frequently encountered in diabetic patients, though there may be no specific link to diabetes . Diabetes is associated with high rates (up to 60% in some series) of depressive symptoms . Whilst it is simple to state that diabetes causes depression, or depression causes diabetes, there is also evidence to suggest that diabetes and depression may develop in parallel and may have common biological etiologies . Diabetes also occurs at a more frequent rate in people with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disease . Antipsychotics can cause major weight gain and an increase in sedentary lifestyle, thus promoting insulin resistance and increased diabetes risk . As such, prevention of diabetes in this group remains paramount, and supported engaged treatment must be provided if diabetes develops . 
Given these outcomes, treatment within a clinical trial is recommended for patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL . Single agents approved for relapsed or refractory PTCL include pralatrexate, romidepsin and belinostat . PROPEL was a Phase II single-arm trial of pralatrexate in 115 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL . Of 111 evaluable patients, 53% had PTCL-NOS, 15% had ALCL and 12% had AITL . All patients also received vitamin B12 injections every 2 months and folic acid daily . The overall response rate (ORR) was 29%, including 11% of patients with complete response (CR) and 18% with partial response (PR) . Adverse events . Notably, 29% of patients in this study responded to romidepsin despite being refractory to their most recent systemic therapy . While the median PFS for the whole cohort was 4 months, it was 18 months in patients who achieved a CR, and CR was sustained for longer than 3 years in some patients . A Phase II study in 24 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL demonstrated an ORR of 25%, with 8% CR . No responses were seen in patients with EATL or HSTCL . However, responding patients experienced a median DOR of 13.6 months . Twelve patients went on to receive stem cell transplantation . A Phase II registration study of brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy in 58 patients with relapsed/refractory ALCL reported an ORR of 86%, with CR in 57% of patients . Adverse events . A retrospective study in Japan reported outcomes from 77 patients with relapsed (23) or refractory (54) ATLL . A European study enrolled 35 patients with relapsed PTCL, 11% of whom responded, with a PFS of 2 months . The response rate was 13% in those with PTCL-NOS and 15% in those with AITL; no responses were seen in patients with ALCL . A Japanese study involving 38 patients reported a response rate of 35% (13 of 37), including five CRs . Responses were seen in patients with PTCL-NOS (19%) and AITL (50%), and in one patient with ALK − ALCL . Adverse events in the registration trial included infusion reactions in 89% of patients and skin rash in 63% . Of 14 patients with grade 2 or higher skin rash, 8 had a CR and 5 had a PR . Lymphopenia occurred in 96% of patients . Almost half (22 of 51 patients) who received more than four doses of mogamulizumab had skin reactions . Interestingly, disease outcomes were superior in those patients who experienced a rash, as compared to patients with no skin reaction . In a Phase I study of duvelisib, 25-100 mg daily, in patients with CTCL and PTCL (19 and 16 patients, respectively), the ORR was 50% in patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL, with 3 CR, and a median PFS of 8.3 months . Some partial responses were seen in five patients with PTCL treated with nivolumab in a Phase IB study . Results in patients with ATLL associated with the HTLV-1 virus have been mixed, with some patients demonstrating disease progression . Further studies are exploring the role of checkpoint inhibitors, alone and in combination, in patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas . A Phase II study of alisertib in 37 patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL reported an ORR of 30% . The ORRs in the comparator arm were 35% for gemcitabine (n = 8 of 23), 43% for pralatrexate (22 of 51 patients), and 61% for romidepsin (11 of 18 patients) . The Phase II BENTLY trial evaluated the activity of bendamustine, 120 mg/m, in 60 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL . The ORR was high but the DOR was short (3.5 months) and only 7% of patients had responses lasting a year . The response rate in patients with PTCL was 67% . 
Advances in the management of heart failure (HF) over the past 20 years have been informed by a better understanding of its pathophysiology . HF is a disease of inappropriate adaptation to injury . In general, however, these adjustments to hypovolemia are poorly suited to pump failure, and increases in the preload and afterload of the failing heart lead to worsening HF (Figure 2.1) . Neurohormonal pathways activated in HF include the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the natriuretic peptide (NP) system . They play a significant role in the pathophysiology of HF, and pharmacological interventions have been developed accordingly (see Chapter 7) . Sympathetic nervous system . Sympathetic activation of the adrenergic system leads to vasoconstriction, which increases the resistance to blood flow and helps to maintain arterial pressure in the early stages of HF when cardiac output is reduced . However, vasoconstriction also increases the afterload on the heart, leading to a worsening of HF (see Figure 2.1) . Angiotensin II causes systemic vasoconstriction and acts on the adrenal cortex to produce aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention . Sympathetic stimulation also releases antidiuretic hormone, which leads to retention of free water and contributes to dilutional hyponatremia . Natriuretic peptide system . NPs, mainly BNP, lead to increased sodium excretion and vasodilation, especially in the early phases of HF . BNP also has anti-remodeling properties . It is postulated that HF is a state of relative BNP deficiency caused by both lack of biologically active peptide and resistance at a receptor level . In end-stage HF, the peptides may not be released because of myocyte loss . Other pathways also reflect an inappropriate response to injury . Cytokine release is increased in HF, leading to a variety of consequences including apoptosis . The role of these as contributors to the progression of HF, rather than a correlate, is debated . Global and local responses to maladaptive stimuli lead to myocardial remodeling, namely increased myocardial volume and mass and a net loss of myocytes . This is not a response that can keep occurring indefinitely - eventually a loss of LV function will occur due to reduced interaction between contractile elements, caused by their separation . The increase of sympathetic tone associated with HF leads to disturbance of the autonomic reflexes . Insulin resistance is an important metabolic sequel to HF . It contributes to the disturbance of myocyte energy metabolism, leading to the description of the failing heart as 'an engine out of fuel' . Causes of insulin resistance include the underlying etiologies of HF (central obesity, diabetes mellitus) and loss of skeletal muscle (see below) . Loss of skeletal muscle is an important manifestation of HF, reflecting inactivity, consequences of circulating substances such as tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta and reduced cardiac output . In its most advanced manifestation, loss of skeletal muscle may lead to cachexia . The consequences of this process include contributions to insulin resistance as well as loss of the skeletal muscle circulatory bed . Reduced renal perfusion in HF (due to reduced stroke volume and vasoconstriction) is an important contributor to sodium and fluid overload . More marked disturbances of renal function, leading to coexisting renal failure, may also occur and pose problems for volume control . Clinical stages and functional classes . The clinical syndrome of HF represents the final manifestation of advanced disease . It is important to distinguish these from functional classes, as described in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which is based on severity of symptoms and exercise capacity and can be used to assess response to treatment (see Table 2.1) . ACC/AHA stages A and B are preclinical; these patients fall into NYHA functional class I . ACC/AHA stage C reflects patients with symptoms or signs of HF, so these patients may be classified functionally in any of the NYHA classes I to III . The functional status of patients in ACC/AHA class D (with marked symptoms and signs of HF) is usually limited (NYHA class II to IV) . The association between functional class, cardiac function (LVEF) and prognosis is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9 . 
Discussion with patient . It is important to reassure patients that acne is common, will not last forever, and that effective treatment is available . Inform about treatment duration and response . It should be stressed that acne is a chronic disease and that no response will be seen before a minimum of 4 weeks of therapy . Patients must be informed of the potential duration of treatment . For mild disease, topical treatment may be required for up to 4 years . Treatment with oral isotretinoin may last for 6-12 months according to the severity of the disease and the clinical response of the patient . It is important that patients receive clear instructions on how to use their treatment, and are made aware of the potential side effects . Choosing the right treatment . For this reason, combination therapy is the mainstay of acne treatment . A treatment algorithm based on the severity of acne is shown in Figure 8.1, and the care pathway depicted is discussed in more detail below . Early treatment of acne is likely, although not proven, to prevent or modify development of the disease; thus, early use of appropriate topical therapy in mild acne (see below) may well prevent development of moderate acne . Mild acne . In general, 40-80% of patients with non-inflammatory or mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne respond to topical therapy; this minimizes potential adverse effects associated with the use of systemic agents . Moderate acne . For these reasons, combining topical and oral antibiotics is not recommended . Oral antibiotics . Second-generation tetracycline antibiotics (see pages 59-64) should be the systemic treatment of choice for those patients who can tolerate them . acnes resistance but development of resistance to oral tetracyclines is a potential problem in patients with acne . Resistance should be suspected if a patient's acne fails to respond, or improves then worsens after 3 months of treatment . The third-line treatment is oral trimethoprim (see page 65) . Global overutilization of antibiotics and the resulting emergence of antibacterial resistance (see pages 91-3) have led to calls to limit the use of oral antibiotics in acne treatments . Moderate-to-severe acne . Hormonal therapy is indicated in moderate papulopustular, nodular and conglobate acne in female patients . It can also be considered as an alternative to first-line treatment with oral isotretinoin (see below) in more severe forms of acne . Expected response . Patients can expect to experience some clinical response after 3 months and the full effect of contraceptives after 6-9 months of treatment . Expected response . By the end of an adequate course of treatment, acne will have cleared in the majority of patients . acnes has been detected on an international scale (Table 8.3) . Preventing resistance . acnes resistance . The advised length of treatment is 12 weeks . Combining non-antibiotic and antibiotic therapies results in more rapid efficacy, and this in turn may reduce the antibiotic exposure time . Antibiotics should not be used in the maintenance phase of therapy . Suspected resistant P . Poor response to therapy . The major reasons for poor response to conventional antibiotic therapy are outlined in Table 8.6 . Treatment may be associated with short-term side effects; these may improve with continued use . At the start of treatment, acne can appear to worsen . It is important to explain why a specific treatment was selected, and to suggest ways in which the treatment can be incorporated into the patient's lifestyle and routines . acnes strains may be sensitive to antibiotic in one follicle, requiring a low concentration of antibiotic to destroy all the bacteria, most of the P . acnes strains in another follicle may be resistant to antibiotic, therefore requiring higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotic . acnes in about 25% of patients is clinically relevant . patients who may require treatment with isotretinoin for . severe inflammatory, nodulocystic or scarring acne . patients whose acne may be associated with an endocrine disorder . patients with social or psychological problems . patients with, or who are likely to develop, acne scarring . pregnant patients with acne . patients with moderate acne that has failed to respond to treatment . 
A core principle in the management of solid tumors is to consider control of both the primary and metastatic disease . Several clinical scenarios occur in bladder cancer . Management of these cancers is discussed in chapter on 'Management of non-muscle-invasive disease' . Optimum systemic therapy with cisplatin-based chemotherapy is standard of care for patients with adequate renal function who are suitable for chemotherapy . Five-year survival for patients with metastatic disease is approximately 5%, although this varies depending on the bulk of disease, response to therapy and patient factors, including comorbidities . The mainstay of therapy is systemic treatment to control the progression of metastatic disease although management of the primary cancer may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and to prevent future complications such as pain, intractable hematuria and upper urinary tract obstruction . Surgery or radiation therapy may therefore be necessary for management of the primary tumor, and sometimes for management of metastatic disease . Cancers where the bulk of disease is metastatic are currently incurable; the intention of treatment is therefore palliative . All these strategies are predicated on whether the patient is able to tolerate the proposed treatment, and other factors such as comorbidities may require modification of the treatment plan . Treatment decisions usually require multidisciplinary input . Systemic therapy for metastatic bladder cancer . Response rates with cisplatin monotherapy were initially reported to be as high as 40%, although subsequent studies showed that response rates of 10-15% were more realistic . CMV and MVAC have been the mainstay of chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial bladder cancer for many years . The treatment of metastatic bladder cancer was transformed following publication of a randomized Phase III trial comparing MVAC versus gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) . However, GC was found to be better tolerated than MVAC and was adopted as standard of care for the treatment of metastatic disease . Modifications to the regimen are frequently made (often with little supporting evidence), such as splitting the dose of cisplatin, dropping treatment weeks or shortening treatment cycles, modifying the gemcitabine dosage, or substitution with drugs such as carboplatin . It is important to recognize when and how far we should go beyond high-level evidence when making treatment decisions with patients . One new approach is the intensification of treatment, such as accelerated or high-dose MVAC, with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support . Chemotherapy regimens in common use for the first-line treatment of metastatic bladder cancer are summarized in Table 7.1 . congestive cardiac failure or other inability to manage a fluid load . However, not all these factors indicate unsuitability for cisplatin . Patients with GFR of 40-60 mL/min can often be managed safely by splitting the cisplatin dose over 2 weeks (although there is little evidence to support this approach) . These points need to be considered when deciding whether cisplatin is appropriate for a specific patient, and when designing clinical trials . Second and subsequent lines of chemotherapy . It is important to reiterate at this stage that the intent of treatment is palliative, which can often be an uncomfortable conversation . Chemotherapy may still be a reasonable palliative option as long as all other palliative objectives are addressed and quality of life is not impaired by treatment . The literature contains many examples of small studies in the post-first-line setting, for both cisplatin-eligible and cisplatin-ineligible patients . Response rates with active agents range from 20% to 80% . General principles of treatment . The general principles of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease are summarized in Table 7.3 . Palliation and best supportive care . Patients with incurable disease must be managed with palliative intent . Any treatment must provide some possibility of benefit, and this benefit should outweigh the predicted risks . Active treatment may still be appropriate, particularly if symptoms are amenable to such therapies and the patient is well enough to tolerate them . The financial implications of treatment may also require consideration . optimal pain management, possibly involving a specialist pain management team . detection and management of urinary tract infections . modification of other treatments (such as cessation of antiplatelet drugs in a patient with intractable hematuria) . radiation therapy for symptomatic metastatic disease . management of other symptoms of metastatic disease . 
The goal of any trial is to determine both the safety and efficacy of a new medical product . Measures within the trial process must demonstrate the product's safety and efficacy to regulators before it is allowed to be labeled and marketed for use by patients . However, measurement in clinical trials does not only inform regulatory decision-making . Early in the development of a new drug or novel medical device, a company will make business decisions about whether to advance its new product for further testing . Digital measures allow for the collection of data outside of the clinic, providing a more continuous stream of data points on whether the drug or device is working or not . Additionally, measurement data from clinical trials inform reimbursement decisions, which impacts the value of the market . Trial success is not correlated with number of measures . It is much more important to select the right measures - those that are the most informative regarding the product's safety and efficacy - rather than the most measures . The ability of a measure to effectively and accurately operate in the wild (exempli gratia out of a patient's home and across many geographies and languages) is also a concern . Medical product manufacturers are often reluctant to assume even more risk - not just in their new product but also in a novel measure - without a substantial body of evidence . Additionally, the operational aspects of the measure and the potential effects on the trial design and participants need to be considered (Figure 8.1) . Changing clinical trials . Traditional clinical trials collect snippets of data when a participant visits the study site and represent a tiny snapshot of patients' lived experience with a disease or condition . Decentralized clinical trials . Digital tools enable new forms of research such as decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), which are conducted outside of the clinic to capture data about a study participant in their day-to-day life (Figure 8.2) . DCTs have a number of potential benefits, including faster participant recruitment, improved participant retention in the trial, greater control and convenience for participants, increased diversity (exempli gratia because it is easier to enroll in the first place) and trial results that are more generalizable . Two features of data collection determine how 'decentralized' a clinical trial is: where and how the data are collected . Where are data collected? In traditional clinical trials, drugs, devices and therapies are administered in a clinic or research hospital . In newer direct-to-patient or remote trials, participant data are collected in the home or in the study participant's natural environment . How are the data collected? In the past, most data were collected via an intermediary - someone from the team would record information in a custom software system and/or case report form . As digital tools advance, we can collect more endpoint-supporting data at home via digital surveys and sensors, and study teams can 'visit' patients at home via telemedicine conference calls . This means that more of the data are participant-generated and collected 'virtually', without an intermediary . A doctor who remote teleconferences with a patient would be conducting a 'remote trial', but they might collect the data manually through a survey, so the study would not be considered a 'virtual trial' . In contrast, a study team might collect all the data passively from a smartwatch in a clinic, and this study would be a 'virtual trial' from a data collection perspective, but not a 'remote trial' because the patient is in a centralized location . As a new field emerges, so does a new vocabulary . What are real-world data? . Real world is a term that is important to define as it is often misused . The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) . These data sources include electronic health records (EHRs), claims and billing activities, product and disease registries, patient-generated data including in home-use settings, and data gathered from other sources that can inform on health status, such as mobile technologies . Real-world evidence is the evidence derived from real-world data . In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute real-world data . However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial . 
This is a major issue in the case of lymphoma because of the different subtypes, many of which respond differently to a given treatment modality . Clinical presentation . Lymphomas may present in one of two principal ways . The presentation can be quite variable because lymphoma may affect any organ . A lymphoma that affects the stomach or bowel may present as abdominal pain, perforation, bleeding or obstruction . However, a lymphoma that heavily infiltrates the bone marrow may lead to a life-threatening pancytopenia (reduction in circulating blood cells) . The surgical removal or biopsy of an enlarged lymph node will provide tissue for diagnosis . Once tissue has been obtained, it is fixed, sectioned and stained with labeled antibodies that identify particular antigens expressed on abnormal cells (see below) . The histological appearance of a tissue section obtained at biopsy is essential for lymphoma diagnosis . Hodgkin versus non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Cells expressing the protein of interest will therefore stain brown (Figure 3.6) . Flow cytometry and immunophenotyping . Flow cytometry and immunophenotyping can be used to establish the following characteristics of any particle or cell . complexity (for a cell this means its granularity) . surface characteristics (for a cell this means the proteins expressed on the cell surface) . A flow cytometer is capable of analyzing cells one at a time provided the cells are in a fluid phase . However, the technique is also increasingly used to analyze diseased lymph nodes, though the tissue must first be disrupted . Each blood or lymph-node cell scatters a beam of light from a laser in two different ways (Figure 3.7): the forward scattering reflects the size of the cell and the sideways scattering reflects the granularity of the cell . Lymphocytes are small agranular cells and therefore tend to exhibit low forward and sideways light scattering . To determine the proteins expressed on the cell surface, the cells are first mixed with an antibody specific to the protein (antigen) in question . More than one protein can be assessed at the same time, as different antibodies can be linked to markers emitting light of different frequencies . The process of using antibodies to define the phenotype of a cell is called immunophenotyping . The immunophenotypes of normal mature T cells and B cells are listed in Table 3.1 . Immunophenotyping is invaluable in the diagnosis of lymphoid disorders . disease subtype . Disease subtype . Identification of the specific lymphoma type is complex . Cytogenetics is the study of chromosomes . In hematologic disorders, including lymphomas, abnormalities in both the number and structure of chromosomes are associated with malignant cells . Karyotyping is conducted on cells in the metaphase (id est the stage in the cell cycle when the cell is about to divide) . Cells for analysis are obtained from a blood sample, or a bone-marrow or lymph-node biopsy . The nucleus of the cell is made to swell, enabling a more detailed look at the chromosomes . However, such changes are usually non-specific . This is particularly so for interphase FISH, which does not require cell growth . An example in mantle cell lymphoma is shown in Figure 3.11 . Molecular genetic techniques . Gene-expression microarrays . This group of lymphomas is likely to represent several different entities with distinct epidemiological and etiologic factors . Expression microarray studies have identified two major groups of DLBCL, which are associated with different outcomes . The first group has a gene-expression signature that suggests the cells have originated from a germinal-center B cell (see page 19) . This group is therefore called germinal-center B-cell (GCB) type and has a relatively good 5-year survival rate . The second group is rather more heterogeneous and is often termed the activated B-cell (ABC) type . These lymphomas have a significantly worse 5-year survival rate . Gene-expression microarrays have been applied to the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma . A correct diagnosis is very important, however, as the chemotherapy regimens used to treat the two disorders differ greatly . Tissue microarrays . 
Intra-articular corticosteroids . Intra-articular corticosteroids have been used in OA since the 1950s, although relatively few randomized controlled trials using these agents have been carried out . As most readers will be aware, there are a number of different corticosteroid preparations but experts have not reached consensus on what dose or which particular agent should be used for a given OA joint . On balance, steroid injection studies, including a recent individual patient data meta-analysis, have shown a moderate benefit in reducing symptoms for 1-3 weeks after injection . Most studies have focused on knee OA, but a 2016 systematic review supports similar benefit in patients with hip OA . It should be noted that intra-articular injection may miss the joint, even when given by experts . Hip injections should always be given under imaging guidance . Such guidance may be of benefit for some knee and hand injections as well . The increasing use of ultrasonography may be a valuable addition to the assessment of OA joints and, more particularly, in correct placement of intra-articular therapies . In OA, intra-articular steroids may be useful in patients . To facilitate exercise . Patients are usually able to start exercise of the joint a few days after the injection . Although injection can be useful in patients with a large knee effusion that interferes with function, the presence of an effusion does not automatically warrant intra-articular therapy, although aspiration may be helpful . Direct aspiration and injection of the cyst under imaging guidance can also be considered . Number of injections . A general rule of no more than three or four injections in a given year is often quoted . Certainly injection therapy should never be given as a sole therapy but combined with appropriate exercises . Injection technique . Intra-articular injections are usually performed using an aseptic technique . Ultrasound guidance improves injection accuracy and, potentially, patient comfort and clinical response . The major risk from intra-articular injection is that of septic arthritis, which is thankfully extremely uncommon when proper preparation of the site and technique are used . It is wise to warn patients that a flare up of joint pain may occur after injection, albeit in a small percentage of patients . One of the potential risks of intra-articular steroid injections is that of worsening OA ('steroid arthropathy') . Most patients have structural damage before injection, and subsequent monitoring of structural damage in the clinic is very difficult given current radiographic imaging (this may change with MRI monitoring) . The few retrospective studies are confounded by the degree of patient symptoms and structural damage . Certainly, prolonged repeated use of intra-articular steroid alone is not optimal management of OA and other options should be discussed with appropriate experts . Novel corticosteroid formulations . New formulations of existing therapies are being developed . This novel formulation demonstrated sustained analgesic benefits following a single injection through 12 weeks in phase II and III trials . Proof of concept of intra-articular dwell time was further demonstrated in a study showing no short-term blood glucose disruption after injection in diabetics with knee OA . Such extended-release formulations may change how we view the use of intra-articular steroid injections in clinical practice . Intra-articular hyaluronans . In particular, HA is generally cleared from the joint within 24 hours and any mechanism of action must therefore take into account the prolonged clinical benefits reported . A variety of HA preparations of differing molecular weight and origin are available, and they are recommended with differing treatment protocols, some being used as single injections and others as 3-5-week courses of weekly injections . Many clinical trials of HA therapy, the vast majority in OA of the knee, have been conducted . Practitioners must also take into account the cost-benefits of these therapies . The most common side effect of these therapies is a post-injection flare up of knee pain (sometimes with florid synovitis), which is quite uncommon . As with all intra-articular therapies, there is a very small risk of infection . Other intra-articular therapies . Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for hip and knee OA have increased in popularity over the last few years . A recent review including 15 randomized controlled trials found that these injections appear to be safe, and may provide some short-term symptomatic benefit .
