'Must test' genes . alterations in BRAF . The study authors focused attention on the better response of patients harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions rather than point mutations in EGFR exon 21 . Identification of the BRAF p . G12C point mutation . Patients harboring NRG1 gene fusions respond to afatinib treatment . A high response rate was found when crizotinib and cabozantinib were administered to patients with a MET mutation causing exon 14 skipping . Tumor mutational burden . Breast cancer . Primary breast cancer . Metastatic breast cancer . These are PIK3CA mutations, germline BRCA1 / mutations, HER2 amplification, MSI and NTRK translocations . These findings stress the importance of clinical testing for the PIK3CA mutation in patients with HR-positive mBC who experience progression on first-line endocrine therapy . On the basis of this study, olaparib received FDA approval for the treatment of HER2 -negative mBC with germline BRCA1 / mutations in patients previously treated with chemotherapy . Patients with tumors that harbor MSI are candidates for treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab . Other mutations . In addition, the tumors acquire mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors including APC, TP53, KRAS and BRAF . Mutations resulting in the inability to repair replication errors result in Lynch syndrome . MSI-H tumors have been shown to have a better prognosis . NGS testing for predictive biomarkers . Up to 50% of CRCs show activating mutations of KRAS . Initially, patients with codon 12/13 KRAS mutations did not benefit in clinical trials, and subsequently mutations in other codons of KRAS and in NRAS were also shown to confer resistance to antibody-based therapies . Theoretically, activating mutations in the genes for any of the downstream molecules in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway should result in a pathological scenario similar to that with RAS mutation . Patients with MSI-H CRC tumors respond to therapy with pembrolizumab . Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations documented in all subtypes (Table 5.3) . The BRAF mutation is present in 11% of patients with mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutation in 5% and KIT mutation in 15-20% . The presence of BRAF and NRAS mutations has not been described in uveal melanoma . Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations (Figure 5.2) . In the majority of cases, a valine at position 600 is mutated to glutamic acid or lysine (BRAF p . V600E and BRAF p . BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma, though these may be of short duration in some patients . Approximately 20% of patients with mutant BRAF melanoma show no response, and most patients treated with monotherapy relapse, with a median PFS of 8-9 months . V600E mutation; its indication is restricted to melanoma patients with a demonstrated BRAF p . V600E mutation by an FDA-approved test . c-KIT inhibitors . The majority of patients with metastatic melanoma who present with the activating BRAF mutation (p . V600K) respond to treatment . Tumor mutational burden . Around 80% of GISTs show mutations in KIT that result in constitutive activation of the RTK, c-KIT . Up to 50% of KIT -mutation-negative GISTs have activating mutations of the PDGFRA gene, usually in exons 18, 12 and 14 . A small subset of GISTS display mutations in BRAF, KRAS, NF1, NRAS or SDH . Crenolanib, which selectively inhibits PDGFRA mutant protein, particularly that arising from PDGFRA D842 mutation, is in clinical trials for use in patients with GIST . Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor . Specific TKI inhibitors, such as crizotinib, may be used for patients with inoperable/disseminated tumors . Molecular targeting in other non-GIST sarcomas . 
By far the most research attention has been paid to the treatment of depression, with relatively few studies focusing on approaches to prevent its onset . It also aims to encourage more healthy workplaces where people with depression can have treatment support without their jobs being imperiled . The most efficient and effective approaches for depression prevention may be those that target populations at risk rather than broader approaches . As well as matching different approaches according to severity, a number of different treatments appear to be equally effective for managing depression . People receiving the same treatments show a range of differing responses, with 25-30% of people treated showing no improvement with initial treatment . At present around one-third of people achieve only partial remission from symptoms despite treatment . Types of treatment . There are two main approaches to the management of depression: pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy, and evidence shows that both are effective . Psychological or pharmacological therapy? Many people prefer psychological treatments, and reviews indicate that drop-out rates may be lower for psychological treatment than for drug treatment . There is some evidence that, for people with less severe forms of depression, psychological treatments may be more effective than pharmacotherapy . Conversely, antidepressant treatment is essential for melancholia, persistent depressive disorder and moderate to severe depression . The nutritional supplement omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be useful as an adjunctive treatment for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder but the effect is uncertain for unipolar depression . Organizational approaches . The subsequent sections of this chapter review treatment approaches for depression with reference to this stepped approach . Subclinical and mild to moderate depression . These presentations do not require formal professional treatment . There is good evidence to support the use of these interventions for mild depressive symptoms or mild depression as a first-line intervention . It causes subjective distress and can aggravate other symptoms of depression . Psychological approaches using the computer and internet . The main options for the treatment of moderate and severe depression involve pharmacological and psychological interventions . Pharmacological treatments . This has led some clinicians to question the effectiveness of antidepressants . Choosing an antidepressant . Monitoring use of antidepressants . For people whose symptoms respond poorly to antidepressants, reviewing side effects, treatment preferences and adherence is warranted . Switching between antidepressants because of poor response to initial treatment is more likely to be needed for people with more chronic depression and more coexisting health problems . Bleeding effects . Suicidal ideas and acts may be increased in the early stages of antidepressant treatment . Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms may occur when stopping treatment and can affect one-third of people . Antidepressant continuation . Stopping antidepressant treatment should involve a discussion between the patient and clinician, and this review should consider the possible need for continued treatment . Some psychological treatments have promising effects in the prevention of relapse and recurrence, even after the discontinuation of antidepressants . Other biological treatments . It has similar effectiveness to standard antidepressants for mild and moderate depression, and has less frequent and less serious side effects . It has been used for physiological studies of neurological conditions and as a treatment for depression . ECT is an important and effective treatment for severe depression, particularly in people in whom other treatments have been ineffective, or who have a high suicide risk or pronounced psychomotor retardation . Psychological treatments . Many people may prefer a non-drug treatment for depression or one that is consistent with their own view of their problem . Psychological treatments have a lengthy history in the treatment of depression . There is good evidence that psychological therapies are beneficial for depression, and several reviews have found only modest differences between these treatment types . Behavioral treatments for depression are based on learning theory, and were initially developed in the 1950s . A Cochrane review () comparing behavioral treatment for depression versus other psychological approaches indicated that this approach, which is relatively simple to deliver, was equally effective and acceptable . The review evidence indicates CBT to be either equally effective or superior to other psychological approaches . Interpersonal therapy is a more recent therapy, developed for depression treatment in the 1980s . Residual symptoms, chronic depression and combination treatments . For a large group of people, remission from depression is partial, with features persisting after initial treatments . It is also clear that when response to single treatment types is suboptimal, a combination of antidepressants and CBT is more effective than either treatment alone . Combinations of psychological therapy and antidepressants are also indicated for depression at the most serious end of the severity spectrum . 
Acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammatory condition that occurs in patients without gallstones . Computed tomography may show gallbladder inflammation, pericholecystic fluid or empyema of the gallbladder . Patients require intravenous antibiotics . The mortality for critically ill patients reaches up to 50% . Gallbladder polyps . Adenomas are epithelial growths that can be precursors to gallbladder cancer . presence of gallstones . Cholecystectomy is indicated for polyps greater than 1 cm, for polyps with associated gallstones and for patients with biliary symptoms . There are molecular differences between gallbladder cancers associated with gallstones and those with an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction . Risk factors for gallbladder cancer are outlined in Table 3.3 . The majority of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas . Patients may have right upper quadrant tenderness and a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant . Transabdominal ultrasonography is the usual initial method for imaging the gallbladder . Staging of gallbladder cancer is shown in Table 3.4 . T1b patients have increased risk of lymph-node metastases . Improved understanding of the carcinogenesis pathways of gallbladder cancer and its precursor lesions . Multimodal treatment approaches for gallbladder cancer . Cancer vaccines and gene therapy . In Western populations the majority of gallstones are of the cholesterol type . Gallstones are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide . In the USA, 5-8% of men and 13-26% of women have gallstones . Other risk factors for gallstones are given in Table 3.1 . However, the majority of gallstones are asymptomatic and do not generally require treatment . Laboratory tests are generally normal in patients with uncomplicated or asymptomatic gallstones . Transabdominal ultrasonography is the preferred test for diagnosis of gallstones (Figure 3.2) . Magnetic resonance imaging has an accuracy of 90-95% in detecting gallstones, although this imaging test is usually not recommended for asymptomatic patients . Surgical treatment of symptomatic gallstones and their major complications (acute or chronic cholecystitis, etc . by cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment for gallstone disease, usually by the laparoscopic route . The patient usually goes home the same day or the next morning . Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the definitive treatment for gallstone disease, selected patients who are unfit for surgery may be candidates for medical therapy . This treatment is most successful for small stones in a normally functioning gallbladder and in the absence of acute cholecystitis . solitary stone . stone < 2 cm . normally functioning gallbladder . Common complications of lithotripsy include biliary colic and pain . Asymptomatic gallstones rarely lead to complications and problems . Gallbladder cancer is a rare complication of gallbladder stones (see page 32-7) . Acute cholecystitis . Acute cholecystitis is the most frequent complication of gallstones . About 10% of symptomatic gallstone patients will develop acute cholecystitis . The exact worldwide incidence is not known but will mirror the rates of gallstone disease . Medical treatment of acute cholecystitis involves . Surgical treatment . Gallstones are the causative agent in the majority of patients with chronic cholecystitis . There is a small, long-term risk of developing gallbladder cancer . These cause the wall of the gallbladder to thicken . Transabdominal ultrasonography is the best test to demonstrate the presence of gallstones . Thickening of the gallbladder wall may be seen in some patients . Endoscopic ultrasonography may be used in patients with chronic biliary-type pain who have no gallstones on transabdominal ultrasound . Treatment is by laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Conversion to open cholecystectomy is required in about 5% of patients . 
Epilepsy surgery . Surgery should be considered for patients with drug-resistant seizures because of the increased mortality and progressive cognitive and psychosocial morbidities associated with uncontrolled seizures over many years . There is emerging consensus that once drug resistance is demonstrated, patients should be promptly referred to a specialty epilepsy center that offers surgery . In some situations, such as catastrophic epilepsy in children, patients should be referred urgently because of the risk of severe developmental disability . In addition to results of diagnostic tests, the patient's and the family's perceptions of epilepsy severity despite optimal pharmacotherapy and their expectations for the future are key determinants in the decision to operate . Types of procedure . Corpus callosotomy is a treatment option for patients with severe generalized epilepsy, particularly atonic seizures with frequent falls and subsequent injuries . A thorough review of the patient's seizure history and AED trials . Sophisticated video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, which localizes the onset of a number of seizures that are typical for the particular patient . High-quality MRI with dedicated 'epilepsy surgery protocol' to increase diagnostic accuracy . EEG monitoring shows that seizure onset is consistently and repeatedly from the same portion of one frontal or temporal lobe . When monitoring shows that seizures arise from different sides of the brain on separate occasions, or are consistent with generalized seizures, lobectomy is unlikely to be of benefit . The introduction of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in 1997 provided a non-pharmacological approach to epilepsy treatment . The VNS Therapy (Cyberonics, Texas, USA) system has been implanted in tens of thousands of patients worldwide . In Canada and the EU, VNS is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients whose epileptic disorder is dominated by partial seizures (with or without secondary generalization) or generalized seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications . The VNS system (Figure 6.4) consists of . a programmable signal generator that is implanted in the patient's left upper chest . a hand-held magnet used by the patient or carer to turn the stimulator on or off . Implantation and setup . The implantation procedure lasts approximately 1 hour with the patient under general anesthesia to minimize any possible seizure interference during surgery . Within the first 2 weeks after surgery, the output current is increased by the physician and adjusted to patient tolerance . In addition, the patient or a companion may activate the generator by placing the magnet over it for several seconds; in some patients, this may interrupt a seizure or reduce its severity if applied soon after the seizure onset . A number of severely affected patients treated with VNS have had clinically important seizure reductions of over 50%, and a few have become seizure free . Patients do not appear to become tolerant to the therapeutic effect induced by VNS . Patients may use the hand-held magnet to inhibit stimulation for side-effect management . The diet mimics the biochemical changes associated with starvation, which creates ketosis . Its exact mechanism of seizure suppression remains unclear . However, interest in the diet has resurfaced since the early 1990s as it can be very effective in patients in whom numerous drug trials have failed, and it does not have the cumulative sedating effects of multiple AEDs . Patients who require tube feeding can be provided with a liquid formula prepared from commercially available dietary powders . Patients are usually admitted for several days when the diet is initiated to monitor for any early complications such as hypoglycemia, and to educate the patient and family on how to administer the diet . Close collaboration between the patient and family, managing pediatrician and specially trained dietician is essential for successful implementation of the diet . In addition, a modified version of the diet (medium-chain triglyceride diet) appears to have similar efficacy . The diet seems to be effective in all seizure types . Other diets, including a low glycemic index diet and modified Atkins diet, are currently under study . Over-the-counter herbal and dietary supplements are increasingly popular with people in industrialized countries, especially patients with chronic illnesses such as epilepsy . Surveys conducted in the USA and UK suggest that up to one-third of patients with epilepsy take herbal and/or dietary supplements, and that most of these patients do not discuss their herbal use with their physicians . Thus, the particular products taken by a patient may be a clue to that patient's side effects from AEDs or comorbid disorders . 
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequently used to support patients with PK deficiency, particularly during the first months of life . When to transfuse . There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals . The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin . Consequently, patients may tolerate moderately severe anemia with few symptoms . When patients have a transfusion, the goal nadir hemoglobin level should also be based on symptoms rather than on a level extrapolated from guidelines used in other anemias . Many patients with PK deficiency will never need a transfusion or will only require intermittent, or unplanned, transfusions during hemolytic crises due to infections or an aplastic crisis associated with parvovirus infection . Others may remain on regular transfusion therapy until splenectomy is considered . Hemoglobin goals . As individuals age through adulthood, transfusion requirements may increase despite a stable hemoglobin, as a result of increased symptoms from the anemia, perhaps related to increased daily activity . Transfusions are associated with iron loading, and chelation therapy is necessary in patients who receive regular transfusions (see Table 5.3) . Partial splenectomy has been performed in a few patients with PK deficiency, but has not been beneficial . The benefits of splenectomy . Splenectomy partially ameliorates the anemia in most patients and is beneficial in decreasing the need for transfusions in 90% of patients . In patients who received regular transfusions before splenectomy, approximately 80% can discontinue transfusions altogether following surgery . Approximately 14% of patients on regular transfusions prior to splenectomy will have a poor response and will continue to require regular transfusions . Patient selection . Preoperative assessment of red cell survival, splenic sequestration and/or spleen size is of no value in selecting patients for splenectomy . Low pre-splenectomy hemoglobin levels are associated with a poorer response to splenectomy in terms of the post-splenectomy hemoglobin rise and/or transfusion burden . The burden of transfusions in PK deficiency varies between patients . The decision whether to have a splenectomy to improve the anemia of PK deficiency is complex and depends on both the physician's and the patient's perspective of the potential benefits and risks . Recent guidelines recommend splenectomy in patients who are reliant on regular transfusions or are severely anemic . Splenectomy should also be considered in patients who receive intermittent transfusions with every infectious illness or who have symptomatic anemia . The timing of splenectomy is based on the risk-benefit assessment . Splenectomy in young children is associated with an increased risk of post-splenectomy sepsis, while a delay in splenectomy in patients who receive regular transfusions is associated with increased iron loading . With adequate vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics, the absolute risk of a serious infection is very low . If splenectomy is needed at an earlier age, the benefits must be balanced against the risk of infection . Vaccination schedules are frequently updated based on new information and vaccine development . Therefore, physicians should refer to an updated website rather than to articles or books for a list and schedule of vaccinations before splenectomy . It is recommended that all vaccines are given at least 2 weeks before splenectomy . Oral antibiotics for infection prophylaxis are indicated after splenectomy . Post-splenectomy thrombosis . Many studies demonstrate an overall increased risk of thrombosis after splenectomy, including in otherwise healthy individuals . After splenectomy, the overall risk of thrombosis in PK deficiency is approximately 10%, including portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and central nervous system thrombosis . Although the etiology for the increased risk is not clear, some physicians recommend taking low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after splenectomy, particularly in patients with marked thrombocytosis, to potentially decrease this risk . Folic acid . With the reticulocytosis associated with PK deficiency, folic acid needs are increased . Supplemental folic acid may be needed, depending on the patient's dietary folic acid intake . 
Seizure types . Establishing the type(s) of seizure experienced by the patient has important implications for . Partial (or focal) seizures originate in a focal region of the cortex (Figure 2.1) . Simple partial seizures . The symptoms and signs of simple partial seizures depend on the site of origin of the abnormal electrical discharge . Complex partial seizures, previously called temporal lobe or psychomotor seizures, are the most common seizure type in adults with epilepsy . There may be a warning, called an aura (simple partial seizure), immediately preceding loss or reduction of awareness . Complex partial seizures typically last less than several minutes . After the seizure, patients are often sleepy and confused, and complain of a headache . Generalized seizures are characterized by widespread involvement of bilateral cortical regions at the outset and are usually accompanied by impairment of consciousness . The familiar tonic-clonic seizure (previously called 'grand mal') often starts with a cry . Other subtypes of generalized seizures include absence, myoclonic, clonic, tonic and atonic seizures (see Table 2.1) . There is a strong genetic component for the seizures as well as for the EEG abnormality . While absences will remit during adolescence in around 40% of patients, related tonic-clonic seizures may continue into adulthood . Atypical absence seizures usually begin before 5 years of age in conjunction with other generalized seizure types and learning disability . Tonic seizures cause sudden stiffening of the extensor muscles, often associated with impaired consciousness and falling to the ground . Epilepsy syndromes . localization-related or focal epilepsies (those with partial-onset seizures) . generalized epilepsies (those with generalized seizures) . Nocturnal seizures predominate, and patients display a characteristic EEG pattern . Seizures have a simple partial onset with occasional secondary generalization . The seizures are generally very easy to control with AEDs . However, many children with mild or infrequent seizures do not require prophylactic AED treatment . It usually begins during the teenage years . Phenytoin (PHT), CBZ, OXC and gabapentin (GBP) may exacerbate the myoclonic seizures . The seizures respond well to treatment but usually recur when medication is withdrawn . There may be a family history of epilepsy . Factors associated with poor prognosis include seizures that have focal features or that last longer than 15 minutes, focal neurological abnormalities and a family history of afebrile seizures . Infantile spasms are sudden brief seizures that are typically tonic flexor spasms of the waist, extremities and neck . Of the infants who survive, more than 75% have learning disabilities and more than 50% continue to have seizures throughout life . Seizures may occur dozens, if not hundreds, of times daily . Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a devastating disorder beginning in childhood, which consists of mixed types of seizures and learning disability . Seizures typically occur daily, often in the tens or hundreds, and consist of axial tonic, tonic-clonic, atypical absence, myoclonic and atonic seizures, which often cause injuries . Brief tonic seizures usually occur during the night, sometimes in clusters . Cognitive deficit is usually present before the seizures develop and may be associated with behavioral problems . Most patients demonstrate abnormalities on neurological examination . Prognosis for seizure remission is poor and response to AED therapy is generally unsatisfactory . Onset of seizures usually occurs before puberty, often with a history of prolonged febrile convulsions in childhood . Postictal dysphasia may occur if the seizure involves the language-dominant hemisphere . The disorder may initially respond well to AED treatment, but seizures often become drug resistant from early adulthood . Frontal lobe epilepsy . Frontal lobe seizures are the second most common type of seizures seen at epilepsy centers during presurgical evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy . In general, frontal lobe seizures are shorter in duration than seizures arising from the temporal lobe, with a preponderance to cluster during nighttime . Because of their often bizarre appearance, frontal lobe seizures are frequently misdiagnosed as psychogenic attacks . How these 'channelopathies' lead to recurrent episodic seizures remains unclear in most cases . 
Thus, the healthcare burden imposed by exacerbations of COPD is enormous . General healthcare costs are also increased in patients with COPD, emphasizing the multisystem problems faced by this patient group . There is no general agreement on the definition of an exacerbation of COPD . Most are based on increasing symptoms and/or increased healthcare utilization . The severity of an exacerbation and the consequent healthcare utilization may depend on the severity of the underlying COPD . Exacerbations of COPD are characterized by worsening pulmonary gas exchange and increasing hypoxemia (Table 8.2) . Respiratory failure may develop in those patients with severe underlying disease or during severe exacerbations . Relatively few of these last studies have involved patients with COPD, and patient numbers have been small . It has been assumed that increased inflammation in the airways is a characteristic feature of exacerbations of COPD . Between 30% and 50% of patients with exacerbations of COPD have a positive sputum culture for bacteria . Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are less common during exacerbations of COPD, but occur with increasing frequency in patients with severe airflow limitation . Air pollution is now a well-established cause of exacerbations of COPD . There are several large population studies showing that the number of exacerbations experienced increases with the severity of the underlying disease . The median number of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD is around 2.2-2.5 exacerbations per year . The frequency of exacerbations can be accurately assessed by patient recall . Follow-up of patients with exacerbations of COPD shows a high readmission rate of around 30% over the first 3 months . Patients with recurrent exacerbations (three or more exacerbations per year) have a higher mortality rate and a decreased quality of life . Patients with acute exacerbations typically present with increased cough, changes in sputum volume and/or purulence, and increased breathlessness, wheezing and chest tightness . Pulse oximetry can rapidly provide information about oxygen saturation, but arterial blood gases should be measured in all patients with severe exacerbations . It is particularly important to consider these differential diagnoses in patients with exacerbations of COPD who do not respond to treatment . Influenza vaccination is recommended since it reduces hospitalization for pneumonia in elderly patients with COPD during epidemics . The effects on the frequency of exacerbations have been mixed . There is, however, some evidence that, in patients with COPD who have not been treated with an inhaled corticosteroid, mucolytics may reduce exacerbations . Most exacerbations of COPD are treated in primary care; only a minority of patients are admitted to hospital . The dose and the frequency of use of bronchodilators are increased in home management of exacerbations of COPD . The use of antibiotics in exacerbations of COPD is still controversial . Patients with purulent sputum and at least one of increased breathlessness or increased sputum production show greater improvement with antibiotics than with placebo during exacerbations of COPD . The use of corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD is now well established . Hospital treatment . Blood gases should be measured in all severe exacerbations of COPD . The presence of a pulmonary embolism, which can mimic an exacerbation of COPD, can be very difficult to diagnose, particularly in patients with COPD . Ventilation/perfusion scanning is of no value in patients with COPD . The role of intravenous aminophylline in the treatment of COPD exacerbations is controversial . Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve lung function effectively in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD . Sputum clearance . Airway inflammation in exacerbations of COPD promotes mucus hypersecretion . The objectives of mechanical ventilatory support in patients with exacerbations of COPD are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and relieve symptoms . However, non-invasive ventilation is not appropriate for all patients (Table 8.7) . Use of invasive ventilation in patients with end-stage COPD is influenced by the patient's wishes and the likelihood of reversing the precipitating events . If the patient remains hypoxemic, the need for long-term outpatient oxygen therapy should be assessed when the patient attains a stable state . 
structural imaging . neuropsychology and functional imaging . postmortem neurochemical and structural investigations . Of the above, structural imaging has been most extensively used to examine the brains of people with schizophrenia . Early imaging studies . PEG studies documented a number of abnormalities in people with schizophrenia, including ventricular system enlargement . This finding has been reproduced many times and represents one of the most commonly observed biological findings in schizophrenia . These observations greatly influenced our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . They provided strong evidence that a substantial proportion of people with schizophrenia have structural abnormalities of the brain . The lack of resolution precludes the morphological assessment of specific cortical and subcortical structures . Ventricular enlargement could be due to morphological abnormalities in any one or combination of these structures . Magnetic resonance imaging . MRI produces high-quality images, based on the use of magnetic energy and the water content of different tissue types . gray matter, both cortical and subcortical . white matter . As these three compartments can each be measured, MRI enabled investigators to examine whether the brains of people with schizophrenia were characterized by specific morphological abnormalities . MRI can also be used to examine cortical thickness and cortical surface area, an indirect measure of the extent of cortical gyrification . Morphological findings . MRI studies demonstrated for the first time the involvement of cortical and subcortical gray matter structures . Specifically, people with schizophrenia were shown to exhibit decreased volume of the neocortex, by about 5%, with specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices . These brain regions are the neuroanatomic substrate for the complex cognitive behaviors that are disrupted in schizophrenia . In addition to volume reductions in these areas, several studies have found that people with schizophrenia have a reversal or loss of the normal asymmetry of these structures . MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of limbic system structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampus (Figure 6.3) . MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of specific thalamic nuclei and total volume of the thalamus . These MRI results are consistent with postmortem study reports documenting decreased volume of the medial dorsal and pulvinar thalamic nuclei . Finally, a series of studies has shown that the brains of people with schizophrenia are characterized by widespread abnormal thinning of the cerebral cortex, with marked changes in the frontal, temporal and cingulated cortical regions . Other MRI findings . In addition to locating the areas of the brain affected by schizophrenia, MRI studies have also been useful for examining . pathophysiological models of schizophrenia . etiologic theories of schizophrenia . Progression of brain changes . A series of longitudinal studies involving multiple MRI has evaluated whether schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with fixed morphological abnormalities, or a neurodegenerative disorder, with progressive changes in brain structure . These studies, conducted in childhood-onset, first-episode and chronic patient populations, have consistently demonstrated 2-10% decreases in cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes and 5-10% increases in ventricular volume . The possible progression of brain changes would be consistent with increased functional disability and cognitive decrements observed in a proportion of people with schizophrenia . Morphological changes associated with specific symptoms . Several studies have observed an association between decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) gray matter and hallucinations and delusions or positive formal thought disorder . These observations have led to the development of etiologic hypotheses concerning abnormalities in the normal process of brain lateralization . Effect of antipsychotic agents on brain structure . Diffusion tensor imaging . The observation of multiple morphological abnormalities in cortical and subcortical gray matter raises the question of whether there is a disturbance in the white matter fiber tracts that connect these regions . There have been reports of decreased white matter volume, but such changes have not been observed consistently . Moreover, traditional MRI structural scans are not able to differentiate specific fiber tracts . In addition, DTI may be used to identify and measure specific white matter fiber tracts (Figure 6.4) . DTI studies have documented widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy (a measure of white matter integrity) in the white matter of people with schizophrenia, but the localization of the abnormalities has differed across studies . Summary of brain pathology . 
As far as variants are concerned and, in particular, when rare or unknown mutations are reported, it is fundamentally important to define the association with the risk of cancer development and progression . define the frequency of appearance in the healthy population . assess the statistical significance of the association with cancer when the same alteration is identified in independent cancer patients . Single nucleotide variants in coding and intronic regions can significantly alter the functions of cancer-related genes . Mutations in these sequences in 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) are frequently implicated in cancer-related oncogenes . Copy number variants represent an important mechanism of activation and inactivation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively . Indels present several issues: in particular, they are not always easy to compare using different variant callers (separating real variants from artifacts), because there are several correct ways of reporting them; this factor may significantly limit reproducibility among laboratories . These heterodimers work with other proteins to nick the strand around the mutation and repair the sequence . As discussed above, MLH1 mutations are related to loss on IHC of both MLH1 and PMS2; in the same way, mutations in MSH2 relate to the loss of both MSH2 and MSH6 on IHC . Overall, it is necessary to adopt all four IHC antibodies to define MMR status . However, IHC can be affected by several issues - for example, false-negative results may relate to problems with tissue fixation . MSI as a predictive biomarker . Because of the development of several mutations, MSI-high (MSI-H) status is a predictive biomarker of response to immunotherapy . Other immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, are now also being used to treat some MSI-H cancers . Tumor mutational burden . TMB is the number of somatic, non-synonymous, coding base mutations that occur in a defined region of a tumor genome . The accumulation of a high number of mutations is able to generate several neoantigens that can potentially elicit a severe immune response against the tumor . In this setting, CGP may usefully detect advanced stage cancers with high TMB . They emphasized that durable clinical benefit and progression-free survival (PFS) were higher in the cohort of patients with more than 200 mutations compared with patients with low TMB (< 200 mutations) . found similar results using a WES approach in patients with melanoma . However, as WES is currently unfeasible in routine clinical practice, with its high costs and long turnaround time, several different approaches are now employed, based on wide NGS panels . Patients were defined as having a high TMB when the tumor DNA harbored at least ten mutations per megabase . Different gene panels are available to evaluate TMB status (see Table 3.1) . underlined the positive predictive value for immunotherapy when mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and replication are identified, Skoulidis et al . demonstrated that mutations in STK11 (also known as LKB1) were associated with resistance to immunotherapeutic drugs . Fusions and splice variants . These are chimeric genes generated from the fusion of two different genes belonging to the same or different chromosomes . In particular, PAX8 / PPARG and RET / CCDC6 gene fusions are more frequently associated with thyroid malignancies . Another important field of application for RNA-based molecular approaches is the identification of splice variants . However, several issues affect RNA analysis . In particular, fixation procedures may significantly influence RNA integrity and stability . An alcohol-based fixative gives better results in terms of RNA quality and quantity than a formalin-based fixative . An important limitation is that the RT-PCR method can only identify known alterations . This limitation can be overcome by NGS, which allows the identification of known and unknown gene alterations for different patients simultaneously . However, NGS suffers from several limitations related to high costs and, in particular, data interpretation (see Chapter 6) . The nCounter Analysis System is another approach . In addition, the nCounter technology is able to identify several gene fusions and splice variants, even when RNA is of low quality and target capture amplification fails . The nCounter system has a number of limitations, however . In particular, results generated by reading the color-coded barcodes are not directly usable for clinical purposes . 
Like most disorders, schizophrenia results from an interaction of genes and environment, with likely gene-gene interactions (known as epistasis) . Classic studies . The most straightforward studies in population genetics are family studies . Usually, a series of individuals with schizophrenia, known as probands or index cases, is selected and rates of schizophrenia are assessed in their biological families . These rates are compared with rates in the families of control probands, usually healthy volunteers . The risk of schizophrenia in relatives depends first on how close the relative is to the proband (Figure 4.1) . Relatives of female probands have higher rates of schizophrenia than relatives of male probands . Family studies can never give conclusive proof of genetic effects, as familiality could be due to a shared environmental factor . Studies in twins and adopted children . MZ twins share 100% of their genes and DZ twins share about 50% . Concordance rates in the two types of twins are compared by looking at the rate at which co-twins also have schizophrenia . Adoption studies offer the most robust evidence for genetic effects, as family environment is taken out of the equation . Both follow-up and follow-back studies (see below) have shown that it is biological parentage rather than adoptive parentage that predisposes to schizophrenia . Follow-up studies trace the biological children of mothers with schizophrenia, who were adopted into healthy families at birth, and compare the number of offspring who develop schizophrenia with control adoptees of healthy non-schizophrenic mothers . Follow-back studies start with a group of adults with schizophrenia who were known to be adopted at birth . The results from family, twin and adoption studies subjected to modern diagnostic criteria support the notion that a proportion of biological relatives of probands with schizophrenia, while not having frank schizophrenia, have an unusual cluster of traits, such as schizotypal personality disorder or schizotypy . A number of other schizophrenia spectrum disorders are found in the families of probands with schizophrenia (Table 4.1) . These cognitive abnormalities may be more sensitive than diagnostic categories for indicating the presence of genes for schizophrenia . They can supplement the use of diagnostic categories in genetic studies, enhancing the likelihood of detecting these genes . How to look for genes . Clinically, schizophrenia varies widely in its symptoms and course . Interaction between genes (epistasis) also occurs . People differ genetically in three main ways . The search for genes in schizophrenia is difficult for several reasons (Table 4.2) . Until recently, the search for risk genes was directed by genetic linkage studies that revealed the location of particular risk loci on the chromosome, candidate gene studies, or the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities that increased risk . Nowadays, the whole genome can be studied simultaneously in genome-wide association studies in which over 500000 SNPs spread across the genome are tested for association with schizophrenia . Risk genes for schizophrenia . It is emerging that there are multiple susceptibility genes for schizophrenia . To date, the definitive genome-wide association studies in 37 000 adults with schizophrenia and 113 000 controls have shown 108 different genetic associations, including dopamine and glutamate receptor genes and calcium channel genes . Most of the genes found by genome-wide association studies to be implicated in schizophrenia do seem plausible in that they are known to exert effects on neuronal systems and particularly synaptic function . Examples are being uncovered of synergistic gene-gene interactions, and of how specific genes interact with specific environmental risk factors (Table 4.4) . Studies looking at patterns of gene expression in the postmortem brain suggest changes in particular functional gene groups in schizophrenia, such as those related to oligodendrocyte and myelin development and synaptic transmission . Rates of CNVs have been shown to be higher in schizophrenia as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (Table 4.5) . As genes predisposing to schizophrenia are now being discovered, there is renewed interest in the association between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . It has long been known that neither disorder 'breeds true' . The children of mothers with schizophrenia have a sixfold increased risk of bipolar disorder, as well as higher rates of schizophrenia . Some genes, such as DISC1 and NRG1, appear to predispose to both disorders and perhaps have their strongest effect in schizoaffective disorders . Raised rates of CNVs are seen in schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder . 
Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly` causes the patient to seek medical attention, and it is usually the most disabling . It is characteristic of patients with COPD to progress through the clinical stages of mild, moderate and severe disease . In COPD, because the expiratory airflow is reduced, the lungs empty slowly . Although breathlessness in COPD increases with exertion, it is nearly constant with time . Some patients do report variation, however; particularly that breathlessness is worse in the morning . Patients with COPD may adapt their breathing pattern and their behavior to minimize the sensation of breathlessness . Mood is an important determinant of the perception of breathlessness in patients with COPD . It may either precede or appear simultaneously with the onset of breathlessness, and occurs in association with breathlessness in 75% of patients with COPD . Sputum production is a common, though not universal, feature of COPD . However, some patients with COPD have persistently purulent sputum; this may relate to bacterial colonization in the airway . Wheeze is common in COPD, but is not universally present and is a non-specific symptom . Wheeze does not usually wake patients with COPD at night as it does those with asthma . Other symptoms . Chest pain is common in patients with COPD, but is often unrelated to the disease itself, and may be due to underlying ischemic heart disease or gastroesophageal reflux . Psychiatric morbidity, particularly depression, is common in patients with severe COPD, which is likely to reflect the social isolation and the chronicity of the disease . A detailed history is important in COPD and should include . family history of COPD or other chronic respiratory disease . symptom development . social and family support available to the patient . COPD is most common among smokers and after the age of 40 . Physical signs . The physical signs seen in patients with COPD are not specific to the disease . Patients with COPD often have a characteristic breathing pattern with a prolonged expiratory phase, although this is usually present only when disease is severe . Skin signs . Clinical presentation . Relatively few patients are diagnosed early in the course of the disease . These subtypes of COPD, however, only partially capture the heterogeneity of the diseases . Most patients lie between these two extremes, and many patients fit neither pattern . Systemic effects and comorbidities . Traditionally, COPD is regarded as a disease of the lungs characterized by progressive symptoms and a decline in lung function . Systemic inflammation in COPD may be the link between COPD and some of its comorbidities . Comorbid conditions have an important effect on morbidity and mortality, and should be comprehensively assessed and managed in all patients with COPD . In general, comorbidities should be treated in the same way as in patients without COPD . However, almost 50% of patients with COPD stop exercising because of leg fatigue, not because of breathlessness . Weight loss is experienced by many patients with COPD during the course of their disease (see Figure 2.4) . Cardiovascular disease is the most common and probably the most important comorbidity in patients with COPD . General population studies and studies in patients with COPD suggest that COPD is an important risk factor for ischemic heart disease and sudden cardiac death . Ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction are underdiagnosed and consequently are often undertreated in patients with COPD . Osteoporosis is more common in patients with COPD than in the general population . Psychiatric problems, particularly depression and anxiety, are common among patients with COPD and are associated with a poor prognosis . With the increased use of CT scanning, bronchiectasis is increasingly recognized in patients with COPD and is associated with longer exacerbations and a poor prognosis . A significant proportion of patients with chronic airflow limitation have features suggestive of both COPD and asthma . The term 'asthma COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS)' has been used to describe these patients . Systemic inflammation has been associated with some COPD comorbidities and a poor prognosis . Spectrum of disease . Many national and international guidelines for COPD have used a simple classification of disease severity based on spirometry . 
The normal hemostatic mechanism and routine assessment tests are discussed in Chapter 2; however, a normal coagulation screen does not exclude a bleeding disorder . excessive bleeding with previous surgery or dental extractions; for example, a need to return to the dentist because of recurrent bleeding from the socket . menorrhagia, defined as excessive bleeding beyond the usual first 48 hours of menses, bleeding persisting for more than 5-7 days or a history of blood-loss anemia . a family history of bleeding . The physical findings that suggest a possible bleeding disorder are . If the history and physical examination do not suggest a bleeding disorder, laboratory studies are unlikely to be helpful . Often, extensive laboratory testing yields borderline abnormalities that do not predict bleeding and merely waste time . On the other hand, laboratory tests may be normal in patients with a clear history of previous bleeding; usually these patients have excessive surgical blood loss despite the normal tests . Appropriate tests in such cases are a platelet count and a measure of platelet function, such as that performed using a platelet function analyzer 100 (PFA-100) . If these tests are normal, bleeding due to a platelet disorder is unlikely, but more sophisticated tests may be needed to exclude some congenital platelet function defects and milder forms of von Willebrand disease (see Chapter 7) . If the patient has a strong history suggestive of a bleeding disorder but normal screening tests, specific clotting factor levels should be measured or more detailed tests of platelet function performed . A prolonged aPTT with a normal PT is usually observed in patients receiving heparin, or when heparin contaminates a line being used for blood sampling . The presence of heparin may be readily suspected if the patient has a prolonged PT but a normal Reptilase time . A mixing test (mixing equal volumes of the patient's plasma with normal plasma and determining the aPTT again) will exclude circulating anticoagulant . Deficiencies of factor (F)VIII, FIX and FXI are associated with bleeding (see Chapters 6 and) . However, a prolonged PT in patients with hepatocellular liver disease will not be corrected by vitamin K supplementation . If a specific abnormality is not identified by the platelet count, bleeding time, PFA-100 analysis, aPTT or PT, patients with a history of bleeding should be referred to a coagulation consultant for further evaluation . Intraoperative bleeding . For example, oozing at the surgical site suggests impaired platelet function . Another important cause of intraoperative bleeding is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC; see Chapter 12) . Avoid medications that affect platelet function such as ASA (aspirin) and ketorolac . Bleeding in the postoperative period may be due to local factors or to a coagulopathy . When the coagulation screen and full blood count are normal the most common causes of bleeding are local surgical factors (exempli gratia a small bleeding vessel) . Thrombocytopenia may occur because of dilution, platelet consumption or impaired platelet production . Giving the appropriate replacement therapy will control bleeding . Rarely, a patient will develop a circulating anticoagulant in the postoperative period (see Chapter 13) . FVIII autoantibodies and antibodies to bovine proteins that cross-react with human FV are both associated with bleeding . FVIII autoantibodies are recognized by a prolonged aPTT test that fails to correct with normal plasma . If this is a cause of bleeding, recombinant human FVIIa may secure hemostasis . Bleeding associated with cardiopulmonary bypass surgery . Thus, bleeding in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is usually multifactorial . Up to 7% of patients have bleeding that is sufficiently severe to require re-exploration . The principal causes of bleeding in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery are . local surgical or anatomic factors . Transfusion of platelets may also be necessary . Bleeding due to excessive fibrinolysis generally occurs in patients undergoing more complicated procedures or repeat operations with prolonged pump times . Bleeding associated with periprocedural anticoagulation . Massive uncontrollable bleeding . Occasionally, patients undergoing surgery for repair of major trauma will have massive bleeding, defined as the loss of 150% or more of blood volume . 
Nearly 1 in 3 patients reports significant concern about their mood . Not surprisingly then, mood states and psychiatric comorbidities substantially contribute to the quality of life of patients with epilepsy . The three most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are depression, anxiety and psychosis . Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up to 55% of patients in some studies - and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than seizure-specific variables such as seizure frequency and severity . Depression associated with epilepsy differs clinically from depressive disorders in non-epileptic patients . Accordingly, symptoms of depression in patients with epilepsy often fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for affective disorders set out in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) . Diagnosis may be further complicated if the patient minimizes their psychiatric symptoms, or if the clinician does not inquire about psychiatric symptoms or considers depression to be part of the normal adaptation to the diagnosis of epilepsy . Clinicians often inadequately treat depression because they are concerned that antidepressant therapy will increase seizure frequency . The overall suicide rate in depressed patients with epilepsy is five times higher than that in the general population and as much as 25 times higher in patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin . Patients experience depression most often interictally as a chronic, waxing and waning disorder, usually in association with variable levels of irritability and emotionality . Some patients experience depression during a simple partial seizure (ictal depression) or during the postictal state . Few controlled trials of antidepressants have been conducted in patients with epilepsy and depression . Electroconvulsive therapy is not absolutely contraindicated in patients with epilepsy but should be reserved for medication-resistant depression . Anxiety is the second most common psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some studies . Patients experience anxiety most commonly interictally in the form of a generalized anxiety disorder . Severity of anxiety does not necessarily correlate with seizure frequency . SSRIs and benzodiazepines are most often used, though no controlled studies in patients with epilepsy have been reported . The incidence of psychosis varies according to the epilepsy syndrome, from 3.3% in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy to 14% in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy . Additionally, it correlates with epilepsy severity: psychosis occurs in 0.6-7% of patients with epilepsy in the community and 19-27% of patients with epilepsy who require hospitalization . Postictal psychosis generally begins years after the onset of epilepsy . Patients with bilateral seizure foci, bilateral limbic lesions and clusters of complex partial seizures are at particularly high risk . Compared with patients with schizophrenia, patients with interictal psychosis have an absence of negative symptoms, better premorbid state, less deterioration of personality and better response to pharmacotherapy . There are no controlled trials of antipsychotic or atypical antipsychotic medications in patients with epilepsy and psychosis . Some AEDs, such as TPM, VGB and LEV, can occasionally produce psychotic reactions in susceptible patients . There are very few, if any, aspects of daily living that remain unaffected by the diagnosis of epilepsy . Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle . There are very few, if any, aspects of daily living that remain unaffected by the diagnosis of epilepsy . Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle . Numerous surveys show that rates of unemployment and underemployment are much higher in patients with epilepsy than in the general population . Patients whose education was interrupted by epilepsy-related complications may need additional vocational training before they seek employment . Whether patients should disclose their epilepsy before being hired is best dealt with on a case-by-case basis . Clinicians should be thoroughly familiar with the applicable laws where they practice, and should clearly document their discussions with patients . Clinicians should also remember that side effects of AEDs, especially sedation, may interfere with a patient's ability to safely operate a vehicle, and should advise patients accordingly . Life insurance . Patients with epilepsy may be unable to find affordable life insurance, particularly if applying for an individual policy . Patients who obtain life insurance through their place of employment generally do not have a problem . 
Prefibrotic and overt PMF are differentiated as distinct entities . Diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia . Thrombocytosis is a major criterion for the diagnosis of ET (Table 3.2) but can also be present in other MPNs; the diagnostic approach to ET therefore generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis . Diagnosis of polycythemia vera . The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PV are shown in Table 3.3 and an algorithm for the differential diagnosis in Figure 3.2 . Diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis . As noted above, the presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include . thrombosis or bleeding . Anemia is among the most common features of PMF, and hence the diagnosis is largely based on a differential diagnosis of anemia . Patients in whom PMF is suspected on the basis of clinical or laboratory findings should undergo genetic testing for driver mutations, followed by bone marrow biopsy to establish the diagnosis . The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PMF are shown in Table 3.4, and an algorithm for the differential diagnosis in Figure 3.3 . Disease burden . In addition to the risks of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to AML, the MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life . For example, an internet-based survey found that almost all of 1179 patients with myeloproliferative disorders reported some constitutional symptoms (Figure 3.4) . The most common was fatigue, reported by 81% of patients, followed by pruritus (52%) and night sweats (49%) . Furthermore, many patients reported decreased functioning, and 14% reported being disabled . With the exception of spleen pain, each of these symptoms was significantly more common in patients with PV or PMF than in those with ET . Constitutional symptoms in patients with MPNs have a number of causes, including . Assessment of symptoms is therefore an essential aspect of treatment monitoring . Risk stratification . Patients with MPNs are at risk of vascular complications such as hemorrhage and venous or arterial thrombosis . The extent to which an individual patient is at risk of vascular complications and disease progression is determined by multiple clinical and molecular risk factors (Table 3.5) . Since the level of risk influences treatment decisions, risk stratification is essential in the management of MPNs . ET is usually considered to have the best prognosis among the MPNs . To date, two prognostic scoring systems have been developed for use in patients with ET . the European LeukemiaNet system, which stratifies patients according to age, previous thrombosis and platelet count . the International Prognostic Score for ET (IPSET)-thrombosis, which also includes the presence of JAK2 V617F and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use to estimate the risk of thrombosis . The IPSET model has also been used to estimate the likelihood of survival in patients with ET although this has not been validated prospectively . In addition to age and history of thrombosis, JAK2 mutation status has been shown to be an independent predictor of thrombosis-free survival in patients with ET (see Chapter 4) but this is not currently included in risk stratification algorithms . A recent modification of IPSET-thrombosis proposes the addition of a very-low-risk group . In addition to the risk factors included in these models, the clinical course of PV is also affected by the JAK2 V617F allele burden, which varies markedly between patients . In a prospective study of 338 patients, a JAK2 V617F allele burden of more than 50% was found to be an independent risk factor for progression to myelofibrosis . However, stratification by genetic risk is not currently widely used in clinical practice . This model allocates points according to various molecular risk factors, and stratifies risk into four categories (Table 3.9) . Clinical presentation . The MPNs vary markedly in morphologic and clinical features (Table 3.1) . Furthermore, PMF is generally associated with the most severe symptom burden among the MPNs, although patients with PV or ET often also have significant disease-related symptoms (see Table 3.1) . 
Surgical resection of locally advanced NSCLC . Surgical resection has proved valuable in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC without nodal involvement or distant metastasis, resulting in long-term survival with a lower risk of postoperative mortality . Surgery also has a relevant role in the treatment of locally advanced tumors invading neighboring structures . Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (T3 and T4 tumors) should be treated with multimodality therapy . The prognosis after operations for T4 tumors mainly depends on the N stage and completeness of the resection . Patients with N0 or minimal N1 disease and complete resection do significantly better after radical resection than patients with N2 disease . The European and US guidelines for treatment of N2 disease are shown in Table 3.5 . Improvement of surgical techniques and anesthesiology has led to extended resection procedures such as carinal resections, chest wall resection with reconstruction, Pancoast tumor resections, vascular resections and reconstruction and spine resection, with low postoperative mortality and long-term survival of up to 50% at 5 years . In the present staging system, T4N0-1M0 lesions are categorized as stage IIIA disease (see Table 3.4), and T4 tumors without mediastinal nodal metastasis are now considered to be potentially curable if complete resection is possible . For patients with resectable stage III NSCLC, the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear . Further clinical trials are needed to clarify the timing of surgery as part of multimodal treatment for resectable stage IIIA NSCLC . At present, the extent of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) disease is staged according to the 2009 tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification (seventh edition) . Tumor size (T) is the primary descriptive and most significant prognostic factor for operable lung cancer . Nodal status (N) . A fundamental prerequisite in selecting patients for surgical treatment is reliable nodal staging (Table 3.2) . Surgical resection of early-stage NSCLC . Surgery is the gold standard treatment for early-stage (I and II) lung cancer (Table 3.4) . Minimally invasive surgery versus open surgery . Interest in robotic lung surgery for NSCLC is rising even though it has not demonstrated superiority over VATS with respect to the length of hospital stay . Further studies may help to determine the role of robotic surgery in NSCLC in the future . Wedge resection versus segmentectomy versus lobectomy . The type of resection (see Figure 3.1) selected for the treatment of T1aN0M0 tumors depends on the patient's age, cardiopulmonary reserve, tumor size and histology . Whether the long-term results of lung-sparing segmentectomies and lobectomies are equivalent has yet to be determined . Lobectomies had better results than segmentectomies for tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter (T2bN0M0) in terms of disease-free and overall 5-year survival . In general, recent studies have failed to show any difference in survival outcomes between lobectomies, segmentectomies and wedge resections for small tumors less than 2 cm, although patients with invasive adenocarcinoma less than 2 cm may have improved survival outcomes after segmentectomy . The results of randomized clinical trials are awaited to determine if segmentectomies may be the preferred surgical treatment for the new classifications of T1a and T1b N0M0 tumors . Regardless of their extent, lung resections must comply with the principles of oncologic surgery in terms of disease-free margins and adequate systematic lymphadenectomy . Patients with multiple tumors and a prominent ground glass component on imaging or lepidic component on microscopy are being seen with increasing frequency . These tumors are associated with good survival after resection and have a lower propensity for nodal and extrathoracic spread than other types of NSCLC; however, they frequently relapse . The main difficulty is localizing the tumor within the lung during minimally invasive surgery . In cases of bilateral pneumonic-type involvement with deep hypoxemia, lung transplantation has been studied in specifically selected patients with a high-risk of recurrence, with limited results . A single N and M category is used for all pulmonary areas of involvement . 
Ampullary, bile duct and duodenal tumors . Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors . Duodenal tumors also commence as adenomas before progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma . Ampullary tumors are relatively common (around 1 per 100 000 in the general population), whereas bile duct cancer is much less common and duodenal cancer is rare . The incidence of duodenal tumors is increased in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and also Peutz-Jeghers syndrome . These tumors often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer, with obstructive jaundice and weight loss . Patients with duodenal cancer present with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to occult upper gastrointestinal blood loss . All three tumor types may mimic pancreatic cancer and vice versa . Pancreatic cancer may invade into or ulcerate the ampulla, giving the appearance of an ampullary cancer . Ampullary cancer will invade the duodenum and pancreatic parenchyma, mimicking pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic cancer may invade and ulcerate the duodenum, giving the appearance of a duodenal cancer . Invasion of the pancreas is typical of a duodenal cancer . Unlike pancreatic cancer, long-term cure is possible in a large proportion of patients with these cancers (see Figure 12.1) . Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors . In contrast to most other tumors of the pancreas, these tumors tend to be highly vascular, a feature that is important in making a radiological diagnosis . Nevertheless, this is a heterogeneous group of tumors and the incidence varies according to each specific pNET . Non-functional pNETs are the most frequent entity, being twice as frequent as insulinomas . MEN type-1 is seen in less than 5% of patients with pNETs . Carcinoid tumors only cause symptoms if there are large-volume hepatic metastases . Non-functioning pNETs are usually large when diagnosed, frequently with liver metastases . Localization of tumors . High vascularity and the presence of somatostatin receptors characterize pNETs . These features are important in localizing tumors, which can often be very small . EUS is also helpful for patients with MEN type-1 or VHL syndrome . It is used to identify pancreatic and extrapancreatic tumors in order to permit timely medical and surgical intervention . The risk of malignancy increases with tumor size (more than 2-3 cm) . Radical resection is required for pNETs other than insulinomas as they tend to be malignant . Gastrinomas are often multiple and are commonly found in the duodenal wall . Non-functioning pNETs have an unpredictable prognosis, even with surgical resection . The response of pNETs to chemotherapy is disappointing . Inherited pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors . A patient with one of these syndromes requires genetic counseling and appropriate genetic testing . Multiple facial angiofibromas occur in 85% of patients . The spectrum of pancreatic islet tumors comprises . gastrinomas in 25-67% . insulinomas in 10-34% . non-functioning tumors, including pancreatic polypeptide tumors (PPomas), in 10-50% . The major feature is diffuse microadenomatosis, with a tumor diameter ranging from 300 μm to 5 mm, usually associated with one or more larger tumors . Multiple pancreatic cysts are common and are invariably benign . The mean age at detection of pancreatic lesions is 38 years . Other tumor types . Cystic pancreatic tumors . These tumors are harmless and may be observed serially using CT or EUS . Other malignant cystic lesions . Pancreatic lymphoma . Metastases to the pancreas . Molecular profiling to enable accurate distinction between tumor types . Specific medical treatments for the different tumor types . Improved surveillance in patients with inherited pNETs . 
Germ cell tumors, the most common type of tumor in the pineal region, comprise a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors arising from pluripotential germinal cells . The most common is the germinoma, accounting for 40-60% of all germ cell tumors . Other germ cell tumors include teratomas, and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors such as choriocarcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor and embryonal carcinoma . The different germ cell tumor markers are shown in Table 8.2 . In the western hemisphere, these tumors account for 0.4-3.4% of intracranial neoplasms . For unknown reasons, the incidence in Japan is significantly higher at 2.1-9.4%, and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors constitute an increased proportion of all germ cell tumors . More than 70% of germ cell tumors present before the patient reaches the age of 21 years, typically in those aged 10-13 years . An increased incidence of germ cell tumors has been reported in both Klinefelter and Down syndromes . Non-germinomatous germ cell tumors are highly malignant and commonly exhibit mixed histological features . Patients with pineal region tumors present with features of obstructive hydrocephalus, resulting from occlusion of the aqueduct of Sylvius . In addition to tumors in the pineal region, a subset of germ cell tumors arise in a suprasellar location . Decreased visual acuity occurs in up to 84% of patients . There are various means of evaluating a suspected germ cell tumor, as shown in Table 8.3 . This is particularly important when a non-germinomatous germ cell tumor is suspected, as these tumors often have mixed histology . Prognosis and treatment are determined by the most malignant histology within a tumor . The only circumstance in which histopathology is not mandatory for diagnosis is when a patient has elevated CSF markers that indicate the presence of a malignant germ cell tumor . Although serum and CSF markers can be helpful when positive, negative markers do not exclude an aggressive histology, as non-germinomatous germ cell tumors can be marker-negative . CSF AFP signals the presence of primitive yolk sac elements, indicative of endodermal sinus tumor . CSF studies and spinal MRI should also be obtained in all patients with a germ cell tumor . Treatment differs for pure germinomas, teratomas and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors, as described below . However, other germ cell tumors benefit from radical resection and mature teratomas can be cured with complete resection . Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with pure germinoma . All germ cell tumors are chemosensitive and successful regimens, usually platinum-based, have been reported for relapse, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment . Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with suprasellar germ cell tumors be evaluated and followed by an endocrinologist . Germ cell tumors tend to recur locally . Leptomeningeal recurrence is usually accompanied by recurrence at the primary tumor site . Delayed complications of radiotherapy are a significant concern . Pineal parenchymal tumors . Pineoblastomas are highly malignant tumors with a predilection to leptomeningeal dissemination (Figure 8.3) . CSF studies and spinal MRI should be carried out in all patients with pineoblastoma . Patients should be treated with chemotherapy and craniospinal radiotherapy, with a focal boost to the tumor site . Treatment of pineal region tumors is summarized in Table 8.4 . Pineal region cysts . Pineal region tumors . It is useful to consider pineal region tumors as a group for the purposes of differential diagnosis . The tumors in this region include germ cell tumors, pineal parenchymal tumors, pineal region cysts, gliomas, meningiomas and Vein of Galen aneurysms (Table 8.1) . The wide range of tumor types that can arise in the pineal region makes histological diagnosis mandatory . The only exception is a patient with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that indicate the presence of a malignant germ cell tumor . 
The expanded genetic characterization of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis is a critical advance in the last 5 years and is influencing both treatment and patient selection for standard therapy and clinical trials in AML . Molecular testing is destined to become an essential part of the initial characterization of patients with AML . As described in Chapter 3, four new treatments for AML were recently approved, three of which are molecularly targeted products, marking a turning point in the treatment of AML . FLT3 inhibitors . The addition of crenolanib to standard 3 + 7 induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML resulted in 88% complete response rate (CR), with no unexpected toxicities . Quizartinib is being investigated across multiple lines of treatment, including induction and consolidation chemotherapy, as a maintenance therapy for patients in first remission after chemotherapy, and for salvage therapy . Gilteritinib is also being evaluated across multiple lines of treatment in patients with FLT3-positive AML, including for maintenance treatment following chemotherapy or HCT, first-line treatment, and in comparison with salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease . Sorafenib has also been explored as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed FLT3 -mutated AML, before or after transplant, with profound and sustained remissions being observed in some patients . Decitabine and subcutaneous azacitidine are already used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and AML . Oral azacitidine is currently being evaluated as maintenance therapy for patients with AML who are not eligible for HCT, and as maintenance therapy in the post-transplant setting for patients with advanced myeloid malignancies . Pracinostat is an oral histone deacetylase inhibitor that is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in older patients (>= 75 years) who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy (because of age or comorbidities) . Venetoclax is also being evaluated in combination with low-dose cytarabine in a non-randomized open-label Phase I/II study in elderly patients (>= 65 years) with treatment-naïve AML who not eligible for intensive chemotherapy . E-selectin inhibitors . GMI-1271 is a novel antagonist of E-selectin, an adhesion molecule expressed in AML cells that has been shown to enhance responses to chemotherapy . A Phase II study of GMI-1271 in combination with cytarabine plus mitoxantrone and etoposide in patients (aged > 60 years) reported a CR/CRi rate of 75% in those with treatment-naïve AML and 67% in those with secondary AML . Novel immunotherapies . In both cases, autologous B-cells are collected from the patient by apheresis, genetically engineered to target CD19, then infused back into the patient . High response rates and durable remissions have been reported in patients with highly refractory disease . Whether the method of CAR targeting can be successfully applied to other hematologic cancers such as AML remains to be seen . A number of other CAR immune cells targeting other molecules are in development, including in AML . Treatment of two patients with the CD123-CAR T-cell product (UCART123) resulted in cytokine release syndrome and one death . Studies with cellular therapies and other antibody-based therapies are of great interest and promise in AML, including with CAR-T or NK cells, and likewise with antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 or other markers of interest . A new era for clinical trials in AML? . Trials of new targeted agents are also likely to be in small, clearly identified patient populations . Beat AML is a new approach to clinical trials, begun in late 2016 and sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society . The aim is to quickly and comprehensively genetically characterize older patients (> 60 years) with previously untreated AML and to treat with novel targeted therapy on the basis of the genetic result . Patients with poor long-term outcomes and lower remission rates with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with a p53 mutation) receive less intensive therapy . Hopefully, such an approach will quickly identify promising agents and speed up drug approvals in AML . Of critical importance to the Beat AML trial, as well as for trials of treatments, is the need to achieve disease control in order to facilitate the opportunity for alloHCT for eligible patients . 
The pathophysiology of acne centers on the interplay of four main factors (Figure 2.1) . increased sebum production . follicular hyperkeratinization . the action of Propionibacterium acnes within the follicle and dermis . Increased sebum production . Acne is a hormonally mediated disease, with androgens contributing to an increase in sebum production from sebaceous glands . Increased sebum production, which presents as seborrhea, correlates well with acne severity . Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is thought to be the main androgen responsible for sebum production, although a possible direct role of testosterone has not been excluded . However, only a minority of patients with acne have elevated serum androgen levels, and irregular menses or hirsutism has been reported only infrequently in women with acne . Follicular hyperkeratinization involves increased keratinocyte proliferation and decreased desquamation of the cells lining the orifice of sebaceous follicles of the face, scalp, chest or back, resulting in sebum- and keratin-filled microcomedones . A microcomedone is not clinically visible but can be identified by surface follicular biopsy using cyanoacrylate glue applied to a glass microscope slide . As hyperkeratinization progresses, a microcomedone develops into either an open comedone (blackhead) or a closed comedone (whitehead) . It takes approximately 8 weeks for a microcomedone to develop into a visible acne lesion . This is one reason why the full effect of acne medications is not achieved until therapy has been administered for several weeks . This process of follicular hyperkeratinization and possibly an increase in cell division and cohesiveness of the cells lining the follicular lumen, producing comedones, has been referred to as 'follicular plugging', although complete occlusion of the follicular lumen does not occur; sebum still flows from follicles affected with acne . The cause of follicular hyperkeratinization is not known but may relate to a local deficiency of linoleic acid or production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 within the follicle . This bacterium utilizes sebaceous lipids as a nutrient source and hydrolyzes the triglycerides found in sebum into free fatty acids and glycerol . The free fatty acids are an irritant to the follicular wall and can lead to rupture of the follicle, with subsequent release of keratin-rich corneocytes and sebum into the dermis . This process intensifies the inflammation associated with acne (see below) . acnes is also a potent activator of the innate immune response in acne via its activation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and the inflammasome (a multiprotein cytoplasmic complex), each of which leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines within affected skin . acnes may form a biofilm within follicles that may make them less susceptible to treatment with antibiotics and oxidizing agents . Inflammatory lesions are thought to develop from comedones following the influx of inflammatory cells and/or rupture of the follicular wall . Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of inflammatory responses even in the very earliest phases of acne lesion development . Papules and pustules may evolve into tender inflammatory nodules or 'cysts' as the extent of the inflammation increases . Inflammatory acne may produce scarring . Atrophic scars (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) are caused by a loss of tissue, while hypertrophic or fibrotic scars (Figure 2.4) are due to an increase in tissue . Modifying factors . Myths still remain about factors that might influence the disease and the appropriate facts should be shared with the patient . For example, acne is frequently worse before the menstrual period . Stress may worsen acne; in turn, acne certainly and frequently causes more stress . The role of diet in acne is controversial . Epidemiological studies suggest a possible link with intake of skim milk, while clinical trials in very small numbers of patients suggest that a diet with a low glycemic index may be beneficial in patients with acne, as summarized in recent systematic reviews on this topic . Questions that patients frequently ask are summarized in Table 8.1, pages 83-4 . 
He has no history of ischemic heart disease or other cardiac symptoms . This is a typical presentation of decompensating chronic heart failure (HF) . Is this really HF? . What was the functional status before this deterioration? . What is the ejection fraction? . Is there coronary artery disease? . Table 5.1 provides an overview of the factors that contribute to acute presentations . The onset of HF symptoms (Table 5.2) may be acute (typically with pulmonary edema, even with cardiogenic shock) or subacute . Both right and left HF may occur in the context of low output (fatigue, syncope and hypotension), and both right- and left-sided HF usually occur together . Assessment of functional class (see Table 2.1), based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic HF because it is linked to outcome - the annualized mortality in NYHA class IV HF is about 50%, which is four to five times that of class II and twice that of class III . The signs of HF are often subtle . The Framingham criteria for HF are shown in Table 5.4 . However, these features are ill-suited to the recognition of HF with preserved ejection fraction, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has proposed the incorporation of imaging findings in order to facilitate the recognition of HF in patients presenting with exercise intolerance alone (see Table 5.4) . Acute heart failure . Patients with acute HF can present with one of several distinct hemodynamic profiles, based on the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold) (Figure 5.3) . More specific for acute HF is Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention . Arrhythmias may play a part in both acute and chronic HF . Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement . Although some patients die from progressive HF, ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF . Blood tests . In most patients, routine biochemistry includes blood tests for electrolytes and renal and liver function, a full blood count (to assess anemia) and evaluation of C-reactive protein levels if infection is suspected . Thyroid function tests and iron studies should be obtained at initial presentation in patients with cardiomyopathies . Type B natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels need only be assessed in the acute setting when echocardiography is not available and the diagnosis is in doubt . In such circumstances, levels of BNP lower than 100 pg/mL and NT-proBNP lower than 300 pg/mL would make the diagnosis of HF in patients with acute dyspnea highly unlikely (beware of patients with flash pulmonary edema or right ventricular [RV] dysfunction where the levels may be low) . Use of natriuretic peptide concentration in the diagnosis of HF in the non-acute setting is a novel indication and will require further validation (Figure 5.4) . An echocardiogram is appropriate at original diagnosis or if the patient deteriorates . Patients with HF who undergo echocardiography have significantly better outcomes than those who do not - presumably because of the initiation of appropriate therapy . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) . There are three major indications for CMR in HF . to supplement poor quality echocardiographic images (often due to obesity or chronic lung disease) . to assess myocardial scar burden . The use of CMR in HF is extremely variable between centers . Imaging for coronary disease and viable myocardium . The role of CAD should be considered in any patient with HF . Coronary investigation is often not indicated in young patients for whom there is a good alternative explanation for their symptoms; however, most patients with HF are elderly and in these patients coronary angiography may be considered if it is felt that the patient is a suitable candidate for a revascularization procedure . Once coronary disease has been identified, the next question is whether this is an 'innocent bystander' . Functional testing is of value for objective quantification of exercise capacity at any stage, but especially in patients who are being evaluated for advanced therapies, including devices and transplantation . 
Over the last 50 years, multiple neurotransmitter systems have been hypothesized to be involved in the neurochemistry of schizophrenia . The major neurochemical pathophysiological hypotheses continue to involve the traditional neurotransmitters, although this situation is changing as novel molecular biological techniques are applied to the study of schizophrenia . The dopamine hypothesis . Dopamine cell bodies exist in two areas: the hypothalamus and the midbrain . In the hypothalamus, dopamine controls pituitary prolactin release (tuberohypophyseal pathway) . First was the recognition of a schizophrenia-like psychosis in people who misused amphetamine, a drug known to increase the release of dopamine . Third was the observation that all effective antipsychotic agents were dopamine receptor antagonists . Four developments have helped to revive the dopamine hypothesis . The reformulation states that positive symptoms are due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, whereas negative symptoms are due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway (see Figure 8.1) . D receptors are the most common and are always postsynaptic . The D family includes D, D and D . D receptors are located both presynaptically on dopamine terminals, where they act as autoreceptors regulating dopamine release, and postsynaptically . Third, more informative functional imaging approaches can now assess dopamine activity in vivo . Studies using this approach have shown increased dopamine release following a bolus of a dopamine-releasing agent such as methylphenidate in drug-free patients with schizophrenia compared with controls, providing the first direct evidence for the dopamine hypothesis (Figure 8.3) . Another approach has examined the effects of antipsychotic drugs on dopamine D receptor occupancy . Studies have shown a strong association between dopamine D receptor occupancy, antipsychotic dose, symptom remission and adverse effects . People with schizophrenia exhibit several impairments that are consistent with altered reward system function, including anhedonia, decreased motivation and failure to use feedback to enhance goal-directed behavior . The role of glutamate . This suggests that other neurotransmitters are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . It acts at ionotropic receptors, which mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and at metabotropic receptors, which activate second messenger systems through the G-protein system and regulate the release of glutamate and other neurotransmitters (Table 8.2) . The N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor and other ionotropic receptors have been most extensively studied in schizophrenia . Abnormalities in NMDA receptor function have been hypothesized to disrupt glutamatergic system function in people with schizophrenia . However, the PCP-induced decrease in NMDA receptor function may also result in a compensatory glutamatergic hyperactivity in cortical brain regions . In addition, long-term PCP administration results in depletion of prefrontal dopamine . One or more of these diverse effects may underlie the broad range of effects observed with NMDA receptor blockade . Some, but not all, of these studies have shown that glycine and D-cycloserine, which bind to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, may be effective treatments for negative symptoms . Treatment-resistant schizophrenia . It appears that people with TRS may have a different underlying pathology from that seen in responsive patients . In TRS, as well as evidence that the expected increase in striatal dopamine is absent, there is an increase in glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex on magnetic resonance spectroscopy that is not seen in responsive patients . Recent genetic research has shown that copy number variants (CNVs) involving glutamate pathways are over-represented in people with TRS . These TRS studies build on other evidence for a glutamate hypothesis . As with dopamine, several families of serotonin (5-HT) receptors have now been identified (Table 8.3) . These receptors are broadly distributed throughout the brain, including the neocortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia . Acetylcholine modulates the release of a number of different neurotransmitters, including dopamine and glutamate . The GABA system? . GABA interneurons may be decreased in people with schizophrenia, with a possible selective decrease in GABA A receptors . Decreased GABAergic function may contribute to altered cortical function and the broad array of observed cognitive impairments . Other neurotransmitters . Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and neuropeptides have also been hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia . 
The symptoms of PTCL vary widely . In the COMPLETE study, 46% of patients presented with B symptoms . Skin rash may be present, particularly in patients with PTCL-NOS or AITL . Patients with AITL may also present with hypotension, fevers, rash and vasculitis-like symptoms, due to tumor-related cytokine release . Table 4.2 presents an overview of clinical evaluation, based on the MD Anderson Cancer Center practice algorithm and elaborated with the authors' clinical experience . Practice is likely to vary between centers . B symptoms should be evaluated and performance status determined . Lymph node biopsy is essential . Fine needle aspirate is not sufficient for the diagnosis of T-cell lymphomas . DUSP22 and TP63 rearrangement studies should be considered in patients with ALK − ALCL, as this may affect prognosis . Bone marrow biopsy . Because 30% of PTCL-NOS cases show bone marrow involvement, a biopsy is recommended as part of initial staging in all patients . Bone marrow aspirate should also be sent for flow cytometry and gene rearrangement studies . Total body imaging is required for accurate staging . Practice is likely to vary between centers . The immunophenotypes of PTCL, TCR rearrangement and putative cell of origin are shown in Table 2.2 (page 19) . Specific markers may be relevant to the classification of particular T-cell lymphomas . CD21 and/or CD23 are useful in revealing follicular dendritic cells in AITL . CD30 is variably positive in selected patients with other types of T-cell lymphoma, including EATL, AITL and PTCL-NOS . CD20 and PAX5 allow the identification of B-cell components and can help in distinguishing ALK − ALCL from morphologically aggressive classic Hodgkin lymphoma (PAX5 +) with anaplastic features . EBV may be detected in a subset of patients with PTCL-NOS, AITL and in all cases of ENKTCL . TCR clonality is negative in 20% of AITL cases, likely to be because of low tumor burden and contamination by non-malignant stromal cells . ALK + ALCL with small cell morphology (5-10% of cases) can be confused with CD30 + PTCL-NOS if ALK staining is not performed . Up to 30% of AITL cases may demonstrate clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements but this does not fulfil the criteria for a composite B-cell lymphoma . Composite diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with AITL should be considered in the presence of sheet-like growth of large monoclonal B cells . Hodgkin-like or Reed-Sternberg-like cells in AITL can mimic classic Hodgkin lymphoma . These cells are activated, usually EBV +, B cells . Staging and grading . The Ann Arbor staging system used to stage lymphomas (Table 4.4)is analogous to the tumor, nodes, metastases (TNM) system used for solid tumors . The clinical stage depends on where malignant tissue is identified and the presence of systemic B symptoms . PTCL is usually aggressive, and outcomes are generally poor compared with aggressive B-cell lymphomas . For example, the International T-cell Lymphoma study reported overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival of 10% at 10-15 years in patients with PTCL-NOS . Several prognostic indices have been developed, informed by studies which identified risk factors that predicted OS and progression-free survival (Table 4.6) . The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was developed in 1993 to identify factors that predict the prognosis of patients with aggressive NHL, as Ann Arbor stage alone did not adequately predict survival outcomes . The IPI has been shown to predict survival in patients with ALCL, AITL and PTCL-NOS, but not for other PTCL entities, and is the most commonly used prognostic index for T-cell lymphoma . Retrospective univariate analysis of data from 385 PTCL-NOS cases identified factors associated with worse OS as . stage III or IV disease . bone marrow involvement . T cell score . 
Pain in patients with cancer may present as various types of pain at different stages of the patient's journey with cancer . Thus, the pain may comprise acute, recurrent or chronic presentations due to the cancer and/or its treatment . Assessment of pain in patients with cancer should be the same as in other patients with pain (see Chapter 2), so that the widest possible range of treatments can be considered, with the aim of optimal treatment . Also, patients with cancer may have pre-existing chronic pain that continues, in addition to cancer pain (Table 9.1) . Finally, patients with cancer require particular strategies during the end-of-life stage . The choice of treatment options is based on similar considerations to those for patients with chronic non-cancer pain . Unfortunately, the prevalence of pain is high in patients with cancer: 20-50% at the time of diagnosis; 50% during the treatment phase; 75-90% during the advanced cancer phase . Many studies report that unrelieved cancer pain is associated with interference with several dimensions of quality of life of the patients and their caregivers . However, variability in presentation of pain and its treatment (see Tables 9.1 and 9.2) make it essential to carefully evaluate each patient regardless of the cancer type . Acute pain occurs in patients with cancer after surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy . After one or more of these treatments is finished, a percentage of patients progress to persistent pain (chronic pain), often caused by nerve damage from the treatments themselves . Risk factors in patients after cancer surgery are similar to those for any surgery (see Table 8.2) . The incidence of such pain is given in Table 8.1 . It is likely that the risk of persistent pain is higher in patients who also receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, in addition to surgery . Many such pains improve with treatment of the cancer, but some will proceed to a chronic version of the acute presentation (Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . However, many patients have multiple pain sites and pain types: for example, a high percentage (30-40%) have muscle pain in addition to cancer-related pain . Diagnosing non-cancer pain is important as it emphasizes to patients the lack of a one-to-one relationship between the stage of cancer and the presence and severity of pain . Metastatic spread of cancer to bone is the most common cause of cancer pain (Figure 9.1) . Yet chronic cancer pain is a nociceptive mosaic; pain may be due to tumor infiltration of nerves (neuropathic pain) or other tissues (somatic or visceral pain), or may be related to the treatment or procedure that the patient receives . Given the spectrum of potential pain sources and mechanisms, it is clear that several elements may be active in a single patient with cancer pain and that treatment should address all the pain mechanisms at play (Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . Thus, regardless of the initial cause of pain, central sensitization can play a key role in cancer pain (see Chapter 1) . As with all chronic pain, psychosocial factors are of profound importance in patients with cancer pain (see Table 9.5) . Saunders' concept of 'total pain' encompasses all of the factors that may affect the pain experienced by patients with cancer, including physical, psychological, social and spiritual elements . The same principles of pain assessment as described in Chapter 2 apply to patients with cancer pain . However, in this scenario, it is crucial to establish whether the pain is related to the cancer itself, the associated treatments or other conditions (see Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . A personalized mechanism-based stepped care model has emerged as the foundational concept of effective cancer pain management, much like for all chronic pain care (see Chapter 3) . A comprehensive assessment (see Chapter 2 and Table 9.6) is essential in identifying the basis of the pain in individual cancer patients (Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . This is particularly important for 'cancer survivors' with chronic pain . Many of the preceding chapters describe pain conditions and treatments that are applicable to both non-cancer pain and cancer pain, with treatments in the areas of pharmacology, physical therapy, psychological strategies, interventional treatments and other options . The main treatments for cancer pain are summarized in Chapter 3 . patient education about pain . cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) . Treatment of the cancer itself . External radiotherapy employs ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells . 
Most patients with glioblastoma present with a clinical history of 3-6 months, although a small proportion have rapid onset of symptoms, clinically similar to a stroke . Treatment of the key signs and symptoms is described in Chapter 5 . Signs and symptoms . The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of surrounding brain tissue and secondarily from the effects of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the tumor and edema . There is no fixed pattern of symptom progression; specific signs and symptoms will vary from person to person depending on the area of the brain that is affected (see Typical locations, Table 1.1) . Patients commonly experience focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, sensory loss or visual field defects, reflecting the location of the tumor . Patients with frontal tumors often present with cognitive deficits, a change in personality or a mood disorder and are often mistakenly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder . Five percent of patients present with aphasia due to a tumor in the speech-dominant hemisphere, which may be mistaken for confusion or delirium . Patients with larger tumors may also experience incontinence and difficulties with gait due to mass effect . Around 20-40% of patients present with seizures, which are most commonly associated with tumors of the temporal lobe . Up to 50% of patients have seizures later in the disease course . These may be simple partial seizures, where the electrical disturbance is limited to a specific area of one cerebral hemisphere and consciousness is retained, or complex partial seizures, in which consciousness is impaired or lost . Partial seizures may spread to cause a generalized seizure, classified as partial seizures secondarily generalized . Raised intracranial pressure can occur as a result of increasing tumor size and surrounding edema . Headaches due to raised ICP occur in up to 50% of patients . Patients may also present with other symptoms of raised ICP, such as nausea, vomiting and papilledema . Symptom prevalence . A systematic review identified symptom prevalence in patients at different stages of their glioma treatment . Glioblastoma is grade IV disease and so is not formally staged . The most common symptoms are shown in Table 2.1; other symptoms included alopecia, anorexia, anxiety/depression, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, gait disturbance, nausea/vomiting, pain, right-left confusion, sensory deficits, skin problems, urinary incontinence and visual defects . Eight of the ten most prevalent symptoms shown in Table 2.1 (excluding confusion and dysphagia) are included in at least two of the three assessment tools for patient-reported outcome measures: the brain cancer-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BN20), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) module . These instruments are mostly used in clinical trials or research studies as a means of monitoring disease trajectory and the effect of treatments on quality of life and symptoms (Figure 2.1) . They are important, as good symptom management has been shown to improve survival in other diseases such as lung cancer; however, symptoms are predominantly caused by the tumor, and to a lesser degree by the treatment . Note: these may occur at different phases in the disease trajectory (see Figure 2.1) . Confusion (40.3%), dysphagia (41.9%) and dyspnea (17.7%) are more prevalent at the end of life than during diagnosis, treatment and follow-up . A higher prevalence of confusion is seen at the end of life in patients with primary brain tumors than in patients with brain metastases or a general palliative care population . Aside from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life in cancer, such as anorexia and weight loss, tend to occur less often in patients with glioma than in other patients receiving palliative care . A study that compared 65 patients with glioblastoma at postsurgical baseline versus 130 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, reported that patients with glioblastoma frequently experience fatigue, suggesting that factors other than those related to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, such as depression and tumor localization, have a significant impact . Thus, patients require tailored symptom care at different times during the course of their disease . 
Population-based epidemiology data are heterogeneous, possibly reflecting the changing classification of the disorders over time, misdiagnoses and problems with case ascertainment . However, recent meta-analyses and population-based registry studies have provided useful insights into the epidemiology of the MPNs . Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are the most common MPNs and, together with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), account for about one-third of all newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies . The incidence and prevalence of these MPNs has been investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 studies conducted worldwide . The crude annual incidence for the MPNs combined was 2.58 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval 1.90-3.50), with individual studies yielding rates of 1.15-4.99 per 100 000 (Table 2.1) . ET had the highest incidence, followed by PV and PMF . In general, incidence was similar in men and women in the systematic review, although the incidence of ET was numerically higher in women (Table 2.1) . By contrast, real-world data from the UK population-based Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) show that age-standardized incidence is similar for ET, PV and MPN, unclassifiable, whereas myelofibrosis is approximately twice as common in men as in women . Most of the available epidemiology data are from Europe and North America; the incidence of the MPNs is similar in these two regions, as shown in Table 2.2 . The meta-analysis also showed that the MPNs are rare in children and adolescents . The pooled annual incidence in children aged <=16 years was 0.003 per 100 000 for PMF and 0.004-0.11 per 100 000 for ET; no data on pediatric PV were reported . Studies from Europe and North America have reported prevalence rates of 11.0-42.5 per 100 000 for ET, 0.49-46.88 per 100 000 for PV, and 1.76-4.05 per 100 000 for PMF . One North American study reported an overall prevalence for all chronic MPNs in the general population of 93.3 per 100 000 . Prevalence in the UK reported by the HMRN is shown in Table 2.3 . In general, the prevalence of each condition is similar in men and women . In general, patients with ET or PV have a near-normal life expectancy with current treatment strategies, whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival . The UK HMRN has reported 3-year relative survival rates of more than 90% in patients with the chronic MPNs (ET, PV, MPN, unclassifiable) compared with fewer than 70% in those with myelofibrosis (Figure 2.1) . However, the emergence of new and improved treatments in recent years has markedly improved survival rates . For example, the introduction of phlebotomy as a routine treatment for PV increased median survival from less than 2 years to approximately 14 years . Risk factors . In addition to the presence of the driver mutations described in Chapter 1, age is a predominant risk factor for the MPNs . In the UK HMRN study, the median age at diagnosis in people with chronic MPNs was 70-74 years (Table 2.4) . PV tended to be diagnosed at an earlier age in men than in women . An estimated 7-8% of individuals with apparently sporadic MPN have a family history with at least two cases of MPN, as illustrated in Figure 2.2 . Such familial cases are presumed to be due to acquisition of the somatic driver mutation through a genetic predisposition . To date, familial MPN has been identified in only a small number of families; however, identification of such cases may facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate intervention . Other risk factors for the MPNs have been proposed (Table 2.5), although in many cases the supporting evidence is limited . Two major long-term epidemiology studies have reported strong evidence that increased body mass index and smoking have significant associations with some or all of the MPNs . 
In patients with presumed early disease, the aim of surgery is to remove the primary tumor, along with adequate peritoneal and lymphogenic staging . In advanced disease, the aim is to achieve maximal cytoreduction and tumor reduction . Surgery for primary ovarian cancer . Depending on the histological grade and tumor subtype, up to 30% of patients with apparently early epithelial ovarian cancer will be upstaged after comprehensive peritoneal and lymph node staging . Fertility-sparing surgery should be considered and discussed in younger patients and those with early-stage disease . Patients should be informed about the risks and benefits of such an approach, and the potentially higher risk of local relapse, which depends on their individual risk profile . Patients with stage IA ovarian cancer and favorable histology (low-grade mucinous, serous, endometrioid or mixed histology) have been shown to have a lower risk after fertility-preserving surgery than patients with a higher disease stage or tumor grade . In advanced stages, maximal cytoreduction aimed at achieving complete tumor clearance has been shown to be associated with significant increases in both overall and progression-free survival . A meta-analysis of 53 studies and 6885 patients, from 1989 to 1998, showed that every 10% reduction in tumor was associated with a 6.3% prolongation of median overall survival . Resection techniques . bowel resection . Extra-abdominal cytoreductive procedures are increasingly being used to achieve complete tumor clearance outside the abdominal cavity . Surgical expertise and training, with continuous audit of surgical outcome, morbidity and survival, have been proven to be important tools in making such extensive surgery safe for the patient without unnecessarily increasing morbidity . Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is part of the debulking procedure in patients with bulky lymph nodes . Timing of surgery . The optimal timing of surgery in relation to first-line chemotherapy is still under debate . Surgery for relapsed ovarian cancer . Despite the established value of cytoreduction in the primary tumor setting, the value of tumor debulking surgery for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is not well defined . These patients have a chronic condition and hence quality of life needs to be carefully balanced with the surgical risks . Secondary cytoreduction . The DESKTOP I trial retrospectively evaluated the survival benefit of secondary debulking in patients with ovarian cancer, sensitive to platinum chemotherapy . Complete tumor resection increased survival, compared with those with residual tumor (median 45.2 versus 19.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-6.05, p < 0.0001) . Using these data, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie (AGO) determined that complete tumor resection was feasible in patients with recurrent disease provided they had . complete resection at primary surgery, or early FIGO stage (I/II) . Patients that met all three of these criteria were given a positive AGO score . Similar findings have been reported in other patient series . The most frequent tumor dissemination site was the pelvis (73%) . In total, 224 patients (54.1%) underwent complete tumor resection . This study confirmed that - even in the tertiary setting - complete macroscopic tumor clearance is a significant predictor of both overall and progression-free survival . Median overall survival for patients without residual tumor was 49 months (95% CI 42.5-56.4) compared with 12 months (95% CI 9.3-14.7) in patients with residual tumor (p < 0.001) . By contrast, peritoneal carcinomatosis was not prognostic for survival after controlling for residual tumor status . Multivariate analysis identified platinum resistance, residual tumor at secondary surgery and peritoneal carcinomatosis to be of predictive significance for complete tumor resection, while residual tumor at secondary and tertiary surgery, decreasing time to second relapse, ascites, upper abdominal tumor involvement and non-platinum third-line chemotherapy significantly affected overall survival . (This may reflect a selection bias, because those patients who were fit enough and able to tolerate chemotherapy following radical surgery may theoretically have had more favorable survival rates than patients who were too weak to tolerate any systemic treatment or in whom chemotherapy was contraindicated . As in all surgical treatment for ovarian cancer, appropriate patient selection is crucial to minimize morbidity and maximize benefit from this radical approach . 
Incidence data specific for AML worldwide are limited, as AML is usually included within the broader category of leukemia in epidemiology registries such as GLOBOCAN . The incidence of AML in the USA is 4.2 per 100 000 per year, with an estimated 21 380 new cases in 2017 . AML accounts for about 1.3% of all new cancer cases and 31% of all new leukemia cases . In the UK in 2014, there were 3072 new cases of AML (fewer than 1% of all new cancer cases); there the incidence has risen by 28% since the early 1990s . AML is rare compared with other cancers, but is the most common acute leukemia in adults . While AML affects all age groups, the incidence increases with advancing age (Figure 1.1), presenting at a median age of 67-69 years . AML is slightly more common in men than women, particularly in the older age groups . AML is universally fatal if untreated . Even with treatment, patients seldom survive long term: according to US registry data, only 27% of patients survive 5 years from diagnosis . Survival is particularly poor in older patients, with fewer than 10% surviving 5 years . Figure 1.2 shows overall survival estimates by age group for patients in the Swedish registry . Patients typically require transfusions of red blood cells and platelets and are at risk of life-threatening infectious complications due to neutropenia . Most patients with AML die from infection or, to a lesser extent, hemorrhage . The role of genetics . Advances in genetics have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML . Genetic sequencing studies suggest that most cases of AML arise from a limited number of mutations that accumulate with age . TCGA has also shown that, on average, only five of 13 mutations found in a typical patient with AML are in genes known to be frequently mutated in AML . Despite the relatively low number of known mutations, there is tremendous heterogeneity in the types of mutation found in patients with AML . Several datasets have grouped mutations into categories in an attempt to understand these relationships . Figure 1.5 shows the frequency of mutation for the most commonly mutated genes, which include FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH2 and IDH1, in a group of 200 patients with newly diagnosed AML . The circos plot in Figure 1.6 shows the complex relationship between mutations in patients with AML . Even in a single patient, all AML cells are not equal . Genetic sequencing studies have shown that relevant genetic variation occurs within the bone marrow cells from an individual patient with AML . Each group of cells with a shared mutation profile is called a clone; typically patients have one dominant clone and several smaller subclones . Figure 1.8 illustrates clonal evolution in an actual patient . Mutational analyses like these explain why patients with morphologically similar leukemias may experience vastly different clinical outcomes . Sequencing studies suggest that the development of individualized therapies that target unique mutations in selected patients, rather than a 'one way fits all' chemotherapy approach (described in Chapter 3), may improve outcomes for patients with AML . Most cases of AML are idiopathic, arising in previously healthy individuals with no (or unknown) genetic predisposition . Advancing age is the main risk factor for AML, as noted above and described by TCGA, but a number of other risk factors contribute to the development of AML in some patients . Likewise, several genetic syndromes with aberrations of somatic cell chromosome complement, such as Down syndrome with trisomy 21, are associated with an increased incidence of AML . Affected patients have favorable clinical outcomes but require lower doses of chemotherapy because of higher treatment-related toxicities . Anticancer drugs are the leading cause of therapy-associated AML . Leukemias associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors typically occur 1-3 years after exposure; AML blasts in affected patients have a particular morphologic appearance with monocytic features . Several disorders of myeloid cells are related to AML and are broadly classified as MDS and MPN, with tremendous heterogeneity within each group . Detailed description of these disorders is beyond the scope of this book, but it is important to understand that MDS or MPN may progress to AML, a condition which is referred to as secondary AML or AML arising from an antecedent hematologic disorder . 
The following aspects should be considered during pregnancy . pregnancy-related liver dysfunction (Figure 11.1) . management of established chronic liver disease during pregnancy . coincidental acute liver disease . Pregnancy produces cutaneous signs associated with chronic liver disease, including palmar erythema and spider nevi . alkaline phosphatase increases from the seventh month to term . Pregnancy-related liver dysfunction . Severe vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy may be associated with abnormal liver function tests, typically a modest elevation in the serum aminotransferases (up to five times the upper limit of normal) and possibly an increased serum bilirubin . The abnormalities resolve with rehydration and control of the vomiting, and no specific therapy is required for the liver . Cholestasis of pregnancy complicates up to 1% of pregnancies and accounts for 20% of cases of jaundice during pregnancy . Jaundice subsequently develops in association with pale stools and dark urine . The liver function profile shows a marked increase in serum alkaline phosphatase and possibly hyperbilirubinemia . Cholestasis is likely to recur in subsequent pregnancies and with subsequent use of the oral contraceptive pill . Acute fatty liver of pregnancy presents in the third trimester and is most common in first pregnancies and with a male fetus . The incidence is also increased with twin pregnancies . Severe cases develop features of acute liver failure (jaundice, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy) in association with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and renal failure . The liver function profile shows increased serum bilirubin in association with a mild-to-moderate increase in serum aminotransferases . The fatty infiltration of the liver may be apparent on ultrasonography or computed tomography of the liver . Termination of the pregnancy is central to successful management of the condition - clinical improvement is usually apparent within 24 hours of delivery . Severe cases require intravenous fluids, antibiotics and supportive measures for liver and renal insufficiency . The prognosis is good, even in severe cases, and rescue with emergency liver transplantation is only occasionally needed . Hypertension and eclampsia . The frequency and severity of liver dysfunction increase with the severity of the syndrome . The dominant abnormality is in the serum aminotransferases, which may be very high and in the range associated with acute hepatitis . Acute liver failure, hepatic infarction and rupture are all recognized complications . Renal failure and thrombocytopenia are other common features of severe disease . Management involves control of the hypertension and early termination of the pregnancy . There is considerable overlap between this syndrome and hypertension-related liver dysfunction, and management is effectively the same as for the latter condition (see above) . Pre-existing liver disease . However, this has not been clearly demonstrated to be the case, and even the stresses of vaginal delivery are not associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage . In most cases, this will mean consideration of propranolol therapy, but occasionally individuals with mucosal stigmata associated with a high-risk status may require endoscopic intervention and obliteration of varices . Autoimmune hepatitis tends to be fairly quiescent during pregnancy, with flares in disease activity observed in fewer than 10% of cases . However, primary biliary cirrhosis may deteriorate during pregnancy . Coincidental acute liver disease . Acute viral hepatitis . The clinical courses of hepatitis A and B are unaltered by pregnancy, but mortality is increased with hepatitis E . Budd-Chiari syndrome . Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of increased risk for the development of hepatic vein thrombosis in susceptible individuals . Pregnancy facilitates the development of gallstones, which are found in up to 10% of pregnant women . Biliary obstruction should be managed endoscopically rather than surgically during the pregnancy . Acute liver failure, unrelated to the pregnancy, may develop after deliberate or accidental paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, infection with hepatitis E or other coincidental reasons . Fetal mortality is very high . Maternal care is standard for the condition, and successful liver transplants during pregnancy have been reported . Surveillance during pregnancy is recommended because of the associated stimulus to growth . 
Incidence and relevant factors . This makes lymphoma the sixth or seventh most common cancer worldwide . Overall, incidence increases with age, although some subtypes of lymphoma are more common in children and young adults (Table 1.1) . Although the overall incidence is 50% higher in men, the sexes are not equally affected by all lymphoma entities . For example, mantle cell lymphoma particularly affects men (> 70% of cases), whereas primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is more common in women . In the USA, the incidence of NHL is 50% higher in non-Hispanic white Americans than black Americans . It has long been recognized that certain forms of lymphoma have an increased incidence in certain parts of the world (Figure 1.1) . This association is particularly striking for endemic Burkitt lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; however, similar associations are also well established for other subtypes . However, Hodgkin lymphoma is considerably more common in the Middle East, with incidence rates almost double those of Western Europe . Changes in incidence . Recent age-adjusted data in the USA (and UK) suggest, however, that since 1990 the incidence of NHL has plateaued . Interestingly, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma has also been stable . Research into the reasons why the incidence of lymphoma increased so dramatically has failed to provide convincing answers . Risk factors . Possible risk factors for lymphoma can be divided into two broad categories . relatively uncommon risk factors that carry a high relative risk . common risk factors that carry a low relative risk . Relatively uncommon risk factors with high relative risk . Immuno-deficiency states are the most obvious examples of a relatively uncommon risk factor that carries a high relative risk . It has been suggested that the rising incidence of lymphoma during the 1980s and 1990s reflected an increasing incidence of immunodeficiency, most obviously due to the emergence of HIV and AIDS . Indeed, HIV/AIDS has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of lymphoma, but it accounts for less than 50% of the increase in incidence seen in the West . Furthermore, since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of AIDS-associated lymphoma has declined . Common risk factors with low relative risk . Many environmental factors have been implicated in the development of lymphoma (see below) . However, it must be remembered that a relatively innocuous environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk of developing lymphoma can contribute substantially to a rising incidence if a sufficiently large number of people are exposed . Nevertheless, it is not possible to test for every environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk . Environmental causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Immunosuppression has two relatively common causes . HIV infection increases the risk of developing NHL more than 100-fold . The lymphomas are generally aggressive: either diffuse large B-cell or Burkitt type (see Chapter 8) . A dominant B-cell clone can then evolve, resulting in lymphoma (see Chapter 8) . Infection (other than HIV) may be an acquired cause of lymphoma (Tables 1.2 and 1.3) . Inflammatory conditions . Pesticide/herbicide exposure has been implicated in the etiology of NHL in numerous studies . However, the results are inconsistent with wide variations in the estimates of risk . Presumably this is because most investigations have been case-control studies in which the estimation of risk is fraught with difficulty . Only a small (and therefore difficult to demonstrate) relative risk may account for a significant proportion of lymphoma cases . Increased use of blood transfusions has coincided with the increased incidence of lymphoma . However, results from cohort and case-control studies are conflicting . EBV infects two types of cell . As the cells lyse, the virus may then spread to B cells . Memory B cells are often infected . Genetic causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Only a few inherited conditions predispose to lymphoma development . In each case, a cofactor such as EBV is needed for lymphoma development . More subtle defects in immunoregulation are also hypothesized to increase the risk of NHL . 
Acute liver disease refers to diseases of less than 6 months' duration at the time of presentation . This category of disease excludes first presentations of cirrhosis, with a few exceptions, such as when hepatitis B or Wilson's disease present with the syndrome of acute liver failure . There are three major categories of acute liver disease . vascular disease . Jaundice is the typical presentation of both hepatitis and cholestasis; the sudden onset of ascites is the most common presentation of vascular disease . Acute liver failure . Acute liver failure is a life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis and a number of other liver diseases (Wilson's disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, Budd-Chiari syndrome and Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning) . The definition of acute liver failure is based on the development of encephalopathy within 12 weeks of the onset of jaundice . Acute liver failure causes multisystem failure (Figure 2.1) . The development of renal failure also indicates a poorer prognosis . Extrahepatic biliary obstruction is the cause of most cases of cholestasis (Table 2.4) . Paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose induces a distinct pattern of acute liver failure . Patients at risk of acute liver failure are identified by the development of a coagulopathy, and encephalopathy typically develops on the third or fourth day after the overdose . Renal failure is more common and earlier than with other causes of acute liver failure . Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, may present with many of the clinical features of acute liver failure . It is therefore classified as acute, even though the majority of patients have cirrhosis at the time of presentation . Idiosyncratic drug reaction is another cause of cholestasis (Table 2.5) . Vascular disease . Hepatic vein thrombosis, or Budd-Chiari syndrome, may have an acute presentation with abdominal pain and massive ascites . A coagulopathy indicates that the liver insult is severe and the patient is at risk of acute liver failure . Management is similar to that of Budd-Chiari syndrome . Viral infections and drug reactions account for most cases of acute hepatitis with an identifiable cause (Table 2.2) . The severity of the acute hepatitis is reflected in three clinical categories . uncomplicated hepatitis . severe hepatitis . acute liver failure . The onset of acute liver failure is signaled by the onset of encephalopathy (a neurological syndrome ranging in severity from drowsiness and poor concentration to coma) . Acute hepatitis has a prodromal phase, during which anorexia, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite for food and cigarettes are typical features . The prodromal phase is as short as 1 week for hepatitis A but may be as long as 3 months for hepatitis B . Hepatitis A is contracted by the orofecal route . Childhood infection usually causes a non-specific illness; the likelihood of developing jaundice increases with age at acquisition . Hepatitis A is one of the few causes of acute hepatitis that results in fever . The risk of developing acute liver failure is only 0.1% overall, increasing exponentially with age . Hepatitis B is contracted by vertical transmission, sexual exposure and contact with infected blood . An increasing number of antiviral agents have become available for the treatment of patients with acute hepatitis B . This entity occurs particularly in patients developing acute liver failure . Hepatitis C and E . Hepatitis C is rarely identified as a cause of acute hepatitis . Hepatitis E is common in the Indian subcontinent, and there has been an increase in sporadic cases identified in the West . The natural history is similar to that of hepatitis A . However, hepatitis E is associated with a peculiarly high mortality in pregnant women . There is no effective vaccine for hepatitis C or hepatitis E . Leptospirosis or Weil's disease is an unusual cause of acute hepatitis, typically acquired by contact with rat's urine . Other causes . Idiosyncratic reactions leading to hepatitis may follow exposure to a wide range of drugs; some of the more common causes are listed in Table 2.2 . Autoimmune hepatitis may present for the first time with an episode of florid hepatitis . 
Despite being the best studied of the glycolytic enzyme disorders, gaps remain in our understanding of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency . More than 600 cases of PK deficiency have been reported, mainly from Europe, the USA and Japan, but the disease occurs worldwide, and it is likely that many cases go unreported . This may be because affected individuals die before birth, or because cases are mild and do not require medical attention . Alternatively, some cases may not be properly recognized, or they may be misdiagnosed . Given that some cases may not present with any of the findings usually associated with the condition, there are likely to be more cases of PK deficiency than are published in the literature . Patient registries have now been developed for PK deficiency, which are helping to characterize the range of symptoms and complications arising from this disorder . Prevalence of pyruvate kinase deficiency . PK deficiency occurs equally in men and women . A study in northern England observed a prevalence of 3.3 cases of PK deficiency per million in a mainly white population . Gene frequency studies have estimated the prevalence of PK deficiency in the general white population to be 51 cases per million . In Germany and the USA, it has been estimated that about 1% of the population are heterozygous for PK deficiency, while a study from Hong Kong found that 3% of newborn infants were heterozygous for a particular PK variant . Because PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, individuals who are heterozygous for a single PK mutation will not show clinical signs of hemolysis or anemia . For this reason, prevalence estimates based on the observation of clinically affected patients will be substantially lower than those based on the prevalence of heterozygotes in a population . The Amish community in Pennsylvania, USA, has a particularly high frequency of PK deficiency, associated with one specific mutation, which can be traced back to a single immigrant couple . An increased incidence has also been reported in children from a polygamist community in the western USA, again associated with a particular mutation . Mutations associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency . As discussed in Chapter 1, mutations in the PKLR gene on chromosome 1 are responsible for PK deficiency . More than 300 different mutations have been reported; most are very rare, occurring only once . Currently, about 25% of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency appear to have a previously unrecorded mutation . Although many of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are rare, a few are recorded more frequently (Table 2.1) . The variability in how PK deficiency manifests is thought to reflect the heterogeneity of these causative mutations, as well as the fact that most individuals with PK deficiency will be compound heterozygotes (id est they will have a different mutation in each copy of the PKLR gene) . Approximately 70% of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense (M) mutations (id est a single nucleotide change resulting in the production of a different amino acid), while the others are more disruptive non-missense (NM) mutations - either nonsense or insertional mutations, deletions (such as the deletion of exon 11 found in the Romany population), or splicing abnormalities (see pages 43 -) . Genotype-phenotype relationship . Current research is focusing on the relationship between specific mutations in the PKLR gene and the severity of hemolysis . Given the sheer number of different mutations and the predominance of compound heterozygotes, studies of the relationship between genotype and phenotype have grouped patients by type of mutation (id est two missense mutations [M/M], one missense and one non-missense mutation [M/NM], or two non-missense mutations [NM/NM]) . Findings so far suggest that individuals with more disruptive (non-missense) mutations are more severely affected; they have lower levels of hemoglobin and require more frequent transfusions and a greater total transfusion volume . They also have a higher rate of splenectomy and a higher frequency of iron overload (see pages 43 -) . Acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency . While almost all cases of PK deficiency are inherited and result from mutations in the PKLR gene, an acquired form of the deficiency can very rarely occur secondarily to other blood diseases, such as acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory sideroblastic anemia . Acquired PK deficiency can also result from complications associated with chemotherapy . 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency and type 2 diabetes by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency . Thus, there is an inability of the body to produce sufficient insulin to meet requirements . Essentially, there are basal insulin requirements and additional insulin requirements determined by foods consumed, stress, illness and so on . Therefore, appropriate dietary advice in the patient with diabetes considers the individual patient's needs, both health and cultural (Table 8.1) . The fundamentals of diet in diabetes . Thus, in some patients, the postprandial glycemic excursion may be less exaggerated if carbohydrate choices have a low GI . Some low GI foods may be helpful in preventing between-meal hypoglycemia, particularly in those patients using isophane and short-acting insulins . Thus, as in all food groups, quantity matters . In the patient with excellent or tight glycemic control, insulin or hypoglycemic drugs may require dose reduction with carbohydrate intake reduction, particularly if omitted from any particular meal . Diet in insulin-treated patients . Insulin-treated patients (type 1 or type 2 diabetes) receiving meal-time quick-acting insulin (either singly or in a premixed form) need to eat carbohydrate at that meal . Patients treated with premeal insulin should receive specific counseling from a dietitian skilled in management of insulin-treated patients . Further, insulin-treated patients may be at risk of hypoglycemia . This occurs more commonly with isophane insulins (with which the hypoglycemia can occur overnight or between meals) or following meals after short-acting insulin . If hypoglycemia regularly occurs at the same time, it would be reasonable to reduce the preceding dose of insulin or, if possible, consider changing the insulin type . A desire to lose weight is common in many patients with type 2 diabetes . There are numerous weight-loss approaches for obese patients with diabetes . Energy restriction . Reduce energy-dense foods . These can undermine a patient's attempts to restrict energy intake and may worsen their glucose control . Food labels will indicate to patients the total energy, fat and carbohydrate content of any particular food . Patients may need support to interpret food labels and identify energy-dense foods . Reduction of meal size is a further simple instruction to reduce energy intake . Another useful strategy is reducing or restricting between-meal snacks in those patients not at risk of hypoglycemia . With energy restriction, the potential for hypoglycemia with the patient's drug therapy should be considered . Patients treated with sulfonylureas or insulin are at risk and may require dose reduction when undertaking energy restriction . Very low energy diets . In selected patients, replacement of one, two or all meals with a protein-based shake is also feasible and will result in significant energy restriction . Bariatric surgery in type 2 diabetes . Bariatric surgery may be suitable for the obese patient with type 2 diabetes, particularly if other obesity comorbidities exist . Patients benefit from support from an expert in the specific dietary requirements following bariatric surgery . It improves the action of insulin, reduces blood pressure, improves the lipid profile and can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke . If there are weight issues, patients should be encouraged to exercise on a daily basis, with sessions of longer duration and lower intensity than described above . Pedometers are useful for encouraging patients and tracking activity; patients can be encouraged to build up to 10000 steps daily . Encourage patients with cardiac disease to build up their exercise level gradually, starting with walking . All patients with diabetes should be encouraged to wear comfortable flexible-soled shoes with good arch support . Patients with neuropathy should be encouraged to check their feet after exercise and treat blisters if detected . Exercising barefoot should be discouraged, particularly for those with neuropathy . As exercise improves insulin action, hypoglycemia may occur after exercise . Therefore, insulin-treated patients may need to reduce insulin doses for subsequent meals and even the overnight long-acting insulin dose . Some patients may reduce insulin doses prior to the planned exercise too . Patients should be encouraged to monitor glucose levels after exercise and snack as necessary . Some patients may need a carbohydrate snack prior to the exercise bout . For prolonged exercise, such as long walks, golf and other activities, snacks may be needed during the exercise too . 
An arrhythmia forms a significant component of a number of unusual syndromes . These syndromes have some features in common: they are rare, many have eponymous titles, and they often have a genetic component, either recognized or surmised, and are usually familial . In some cases this leads to an arrhythmia that can cause sudden death in an apparently healthy individual with a structurally normal heart . Patients can have long periods between arrhythmic events . As a group these syndromes are referred to as channelopathies, and include the long and short QT syndromes and Brugada syndrome . Long QT syndromes . Syncope and sudden death may result from torsades de pointes . Many patients are initially labeled as having epilepsy . Several forms of congenital LQTS have been described; three forms have been well characterized (LQT1, LQT2, LQT3) . Most commonly, sudden death in LQT1 is seen after physical exertion (exempli gratia in athletes); in LQT2 sudden death or syncope is usually seen during emotional stress; and in LQT3 sudden death can occur during sleep . mexiletine (in LQT3) . In many cases beta-blockade produces significant bradycardia (which itself increases the QT interval); these cases benefit from additional pacing, usually within the atria only . In rare cases, an ICD is required, although this is often a last resort because patients are mostly children . Acquired long QT syndrome is most commonly either drug-induced or due to a profound biochemical abnormality, usually hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia . Drugs that prolong the QT interval are shown in Table 11.1 . It should be remembered that by their very action some antiarrhythmic drugs prolong the QT interval . This does not mean the drug should be stopped . Antiarrhythmic agents capable of prolonging the QT interval should not be used together . Over the years, many drugs have been withdrawn from general use because of complications associated with QT prolongation and increased risk of sudden death (exempli gratia cisapride, terodiline) . A comprehensive list of drugs that prolong the QT interval and/or induce torsades de pointes can be accessed from . Short QT syndrome . It is a rare syndrome characterized by sudden death due to idiopathic VF in an otherwise apparently structurally normal heart . More than 80 mutations in the sodium-channel gene have been identified in patients with Brugada syndrome . The diagnostic ECG abnormality is shown in Figure 11.2 . An ICD is the treatment of choice in patients with syncope, resuscitated sudden death or inducible ventricular arrhythmias . Electrophysiological testing may be useful in asymptomatic cases (exempli gratia patients in whom Brugada syndrome is found incidentally) to assess the risk of sudden death . Lists of drugs that should be avoided by patients with Brugada syndrome can be found at . Patients presenting with resuscitated sudden death are at highest risk of recurrence . The role of electrophysiological testing has been debated; it is used predominantly to assess the risk of sudden death . Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a rare but important cause of VT and sudden death, particularly in young men; in particular, it causes tachycardia on vigorous exercise . Abnormal myocardial architecture and fiber disarray contribute to increased risk of VF in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Five factors have been associated with an increased risk of sudden death, and such patients should be considered for an ICD . non-sustained VT on ambulatory ECG monitoring . family history of sudden death . Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a rare genetic abnormality, first described in children, which causes syncope and sudden death due to bidirectional or polymorphic VT following exercise or stress . Genetics and sudden death . Although there is evidence of coronary disease in 80% of cases of sudden death, and some form of cardiomyopathy in 5%, no clear structural defect is found in up to one-third of postmortems in sudden death cases . 
Glomerular or tubular involvement may be a major feature of systemic autoimmune diseases, and may result from the deposition of abnormal proteins in dysproteinemias . Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that is most common in young women and often affects the joints, skin, nervous system and kidneys . Approximately 50% of patients with SLE will eventually develop kidney disease . This may affect the glomeruli directly, small blood vessels within the kidney or the interstitium . class I - minimal mesangial lupus nephritis . class II - mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis . class III - focal lupus nephritis . class IV-S - diffuse segmental lupus nephritis . class IV-G - global lupus nephritis . class V - membranous lupus nephritis . class VI - advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis . Clinical features . Lupus nephritis can present with any of the clinical syndromes described earlier, depending on the severity of glomerular injury . Treatment depends on the severity of the kidney lesion . Primary systemic vasculitis . In some patients, vasculitis appears to be restricted to the kidney . There are no or scanty immune deposits . Clinical features . Patients generally present with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, although in some patients there may be repeated episodes of less severe renal disease, leading to glomerular scarring together with active lesions . Most patients respond well to treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide . Patients with severe kidney failure or other life-threatening features of disease are generally treated with additional intravenous methylprednisolone and/or plasma exchange . With aggressive treatment, most patients, even those on dialysis, will recover kidney function . Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a form of thrombotic microangiopathy, with a tendency to affect the kidney . Kidney histology reveals widespread intraglomerular thrombi, together with an occlusive vasculopathy . Kidney involvement is often accompanied by hematologic and neurological manifestations . The role of specific treatment in this so-called D+ HUS is unclear . Systemic sclerosis . Systemic sclerosis may affect the kidney by causing an obstructive vasculopathy of small renal arteries - so-called 'scleroderma kidney' . Clinical features . Systemic sclerosis of the kidney presents with subacute or acute renal impairment . Although systemic features of scleroderma are generally present (exempli gratia thickening of the skin, telangiectasia, esophageal dysfunction), kidney involvement may occasionally be the presenting feature . The typical kidney lesion is a granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis, which can lead to functional impairment . This will generally respond to treatment with corticosteroids . Sarcoidosis may also lead to hypercalcemia, which can itself cause kidney dysfunction . Treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in type I cryoglobulinemia generally involves plasma exchange to reduce paraprotein levels, together with appropriate chemotherapy . Clinical features commonly include a purpuric rash, arthralgia and peripheral neuropathy . Type III cryoglobulins are generally related to an underlying autoimmune disease or chronic infection . They rarely cause severe renal disease . Treatment involves management of the underlying disorder . Multiple myeloma may affect the kidney in many different ways (Table 7.2) . The term amyloid is used to describe insoluble deposits of protein formed by the association of amyloid P component, together with other proteins that possess characteristic physicochemical properties . The commonest forms affecting the kidney are AL amyloid, in which Ig light chains are involved, and AA amyloid, in which amyloid A protein produced by chronic inflammation is involved . Amyloid deposition in the kidney commonly results in nephrotic syndrome, usually associated with progressive renal impairment . Reducing the load of amyloid precursor proteins may allow resolution of the condition (slowly) . The natural history is generally of progression . 
The mortality and morbidity of bladder cancer could be reduced in several ways . improving prevention . earlier diagnosis . better treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease . improved use of existing therapies . identification of biomarkers that allow better risk stratification and selection of treatment . development of new therapies and rational combinations . better involvement of palliative and supportive care . Improving prevention . Earlier diagnosis . Better treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease . Most non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is low or intermediate risk (low-grade Ta), can be managed endoscopically and requires only limited further assessment or treatment . Advances in the near future will probably include systemic immunotherapy, if these treatments are shown to improve control or cure and reduce recurrence and progression, with an acceptable safety profile and cost-effectiveness . Treatment is also likely to be stratified according to molecular and genomic profiling of the tumor rather than conventional light microscopic appearance . More accurate imaging modalities may allow better detection and management of residual or micrometastatic disease, with consequent improvements in the stratification of patients into more appropriate treatment pathways . Improved use of existing therapies . These changes mean that treatment can be given more safely, at more effective doses, for the planned duration, and to a broader range of patients . Many patients now have excellent outcomes with established treatments such as systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and further improvements could be realized through more widespread use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for suitable patients . Future advances in this area will be based on . use of active therapies at earlier stages in the treatment pathways . better access to therapies, particularly in low- or middle-income countries . Identification of biomarkers that allow better risk stratification and treatment selection . Better technology in this arena, including tests that are less invasive than cystoscopy or biopsy and therefore more acceptable to patients, will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and reduction of costs . Development of new therapies and rational combinations . Advances in our understanding of the biology of the complex conditions known as 'bladder cancer' will enable identification of more potential options for treatment . Rational targets for treatment can be identified, lessons learned from other malignancies, and treatments used in other malignancies may be logically evaluated in bladder cancer and existing treatments used more effectively . The number of potential permutations and combinations of existing and future therapies is daunting, and becomes even more challenging when the various stages of bladder cancer are considered, and the ways in which initial treatment selection may affect subsequent sequencing of treatments . Clinical research must be based on understanding of the clinical imperative to provide benefit to the patient throughout their entire treatment journey, rather than traditional drug development strategies, and it is insufficient to show activity or benefit from one treatment at one stage of the disease . We must understand how and when such treatments should be integrated into the overall treatment course in order to achieve best outcomes for our patients . The collection of data and samples for future research is also important . For example, clinical samples used for diagnostic purposes are not made available for research . Better involvement of palliative and supportive care . Most of the progress in bladder cancer management in the last 20 years has been in supportive care . This relates to improvement in quality of life through better control of symptoms, reduction in treatment-related toxicity, improved management of comorbidities and involvement of other disciplines such as exercise physiology, where improvements in cancer-specific outcomes can also be shown . There is a risk that quality of life is sacrificed by favoring treatments that have good efficacy but might be toxic . Whilst this is understandable, our patients often tell us that quality of life is more important than extending survival . It is important to recognize this, and to remember when considering the choice of treatment in the setting of incurable cancer, that improvement, or at least maintenance, of quality of life and functioning is a paramount objective . It is heartening to see this growing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes . A further benefit from this approach is the focus on reducing and managing the toxicities of treatment, with consequent improvements in response (and potentially cure) rates as well . Future developments in this area are likely to include . improved identification and appropriate streaming of patients through the healthcare system, and management of treatment side-effects . improved patient education and empowerment, to ensure toxicities of treatment and complications of the disease are managed appropriately . 
In 2000, he was awarded the Nobel prize for the first description of levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease . demonstrated the dramatic clinical effects of high-dose oral levodopa therapy, revolutionizing the treatment of Parkinson's disease . Patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately, although in some cases a delayed effect is seen after prolonged treatment . These concerns gave rise to 'levodopa phobia' in many patients, denying them the benefit of levodopa treatment . These findings should reassure patients receiving long-term levodopa . The ELLDOPA study (see below) in patients with early Parkinson's disease suggests that a higher dosage of levodopa leads to a higher frequency of dyskinesia . Many trials have compared these dopamine agonists with levodopa in previously untreated patients over a 4-5 year period . The ELLDOPA study (Early versus Late LevoDOPA in Parkinson's disease) evaluated previously untreated patients randomized to three doses (150, 300 or 600 mg) of levodopa or placebo . Levodopa-treated patients showed a significant improvement in motor scores at all three doses compared with those receiving placebo . Levodopa formulations . LCE caused a significant increase in dyskinesia in patients who were taking dopamine agonists, but not in patients who were not taking dopamine agonists . Studies have shown that this infusion is effective in controlling motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease and reduces dyskinesias . It also enables the patient to discontinue oral dopaminergic treatment and apomorphine infusion . The trial showed that ER CD-LD is safe and efficacious in patients with early Parkinson's disease . Dopamine agonists . Comparative studies of the efficacy of these newer dopamine agonists are scarce . CDS may also improve some aspects of sleep in patients with Parkinson's disease . Both are effective in early and late disease as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy . Since then, similar episodes of unintended sleep have been reported in patients taking other dopaminergic drugs . Approximately 1200 patients were enrolled worldwide in phase 3 trials in which rotigotine provided effective relief from the symptoms of both early and advanced Parkinson's disease . Occasionally, patients can stop taking levodopa, but most need regular doses in addition to apomorphine . Side effects of dopamine agonists . Patients crave the drug and have unpleasant 'off' periods . Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome . The patient consent form has been replaced with a patient acknowledgment form . Patients should be warned that the drug may color their urine . Other drugs . It is being investigated for use in levodopa-treated fluctuating patients and its effect on 'off' and 'on' times without troublesome dyskinesias . increased dopamine synthesis . The effect is long-lasting, and patients may deteriorate markedly if the drug is withdrawn . When to initiate treatment . PDLIFE study . Choice of treatment . For these reasons, many younger patients will choose a levodopa-sparing strategy, while older patients may prefer levodopa therapy (see below) . Key recommendations are that patients and their carers should be involved in deciding their treatment and care, and that the choice of treatment should suit the patient's needs and preferences . The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be reviewed every 6-12 months . attitudes to drug treatment . non-motor symptoms . Dopamine agonist versus levodopa . In younger patients, the issues of neuroprotection and dyskinesias should be considered . In total, 1620 patients with early Parkinson's disease were recruited and given one of three initial treatment regimens . levodopa formulation (528 patients) . levodopa-sparing strategy - dopamine agonist (632 patients) . Scales for monitoring Parkinson's disease, and thus the response to treatment, include . EuroQol (patient-related quality of life) . Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale . Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale . In total, 411 patients were included in the primary assessment . Treatment of non-motor symptoms . The few randomized controlled studies that have addressed the non-motor aspects of Parkinson's disease are outlined below . The study did not reach statistical significance . 
The most common causes of blurred vision are refractive error (in the young) and cataract (in the elderly) . Causes of acute visual loss . Retinal detachment . Short-sighted patients have a greater risk of retinal detachment . Patients with retinal detachment complain of one or more of . Patients complain of sudden or subacute blurring of vision or visual field loss in one eye . Examination shows . Patients complain of floaters and blurred vision . Examination shows normal or reduced acuity, but usually no RAPD unless retinal detachment is also present . Any diabetic patient complaining of new-onset floaters (with or without blurred vision) should be taken especially seriously, because of the high risk that new vessels are bleeding . There are many possible causes of acute optic neuropathy . In young adults, the most common cause is 'typical' optic neuritis (an early sign of multiple sclerosis in some, but not all, patients) . Rapid unilateral loss of vision occurs, with pain that worsens when the eye moves . Vision loss soon after eye surgery . If the patient develops blurred vision with a 'white' eye soon after eye surgery, they could have retinal detachment, or a swelling of the macula called cystoid macular edema . Urgent referral is needed if patients develop problems following surgery . Causes of gradual visual loss . It is rare for patients to complain of blurred vision due to uncorrected refractive error, as the first thing patients with blurred vision usually do is have their glasses checked . presbyopia (the loss of the eye's ability to focus on close objects with age) . Middle-aged patients whose distance vision is fine, but whose reading vision is deteriorating, may be experiencing presbyopia . Cataract is a clouding of the eye's normally clear lens (Figure 3.6) . Cataract usually occurs in the elderly, or in younger patients with diabetes, intraocular inflammation or eye trauma . Patients complain of gradually progressive blurring of vision, which may be asymmetric, and sometimes glare in bright lights . Chronic glaucoma causes slow, painless loss of vision, which is usually not noticed by the patient because peripheral vision is lost first . The examination should include an eye pressure test, optic disc examination and automated visual fields . The eyes of a patient with chronic glaucoma appear entirely normal on examination, apart from raised intraocular pressure (in most but not all patients) and characteristic 'cupping' of one or both optic discs (Figure 3.7) . All of your practice's diabetic patients should be enrolled for regular (usually annual) diabetic retinopathy screening . Patients who have advanced diabetic maculopathy that has not been detected by screening complain of blurred vision and metamorphopsia . Because of the high risk of serious retinal disease, diabetic patients who complain of acute or subacute onset of blurred vision or visual distortion require urgent referral . Patients complain of increasing difficulty reading and blurred central vision with preserved peripheral vision . Superimposed on this gradual decline of vision, a minority of patients also experience a sudden loss of central vision with distortion due to the development of 'wet' AMD . Low-vision aids, such as magnifiers and good lighting, often help to maximize the patient's vision if they have dry changes, but urgent referral is needed for patients with 'wet' AMD so that anti-VEGF injection treatment can be given quickly . Causes of transient visual loss . Eye examination findings after the attack are usually entirely normal . In some cases, patients may also mistake transient binocular homonymous visual loss (see below) as being in one eye only . Transient visual loss in both eyes simultaneously is most commonly caused by the binocular 'scintillating scotoma' that occurs before the onset of headache in many patients with migraine . This scotoma may sometimes occur in known migraine patients without headache (acephalgic migraine) . Migraine rarely develops over the age of 50 without the patient having had at least one previous attack in earlier life . Papilledema (bilateral optic disc swelling due to raised intracranial pressure) can also cause fading out of vision in one or both eyes, usually for seconds at a time . Delay in referral of urgent cases, of even a few days, can cost the patient their sight . 
FFPE histological samples represent the gold standard starting material from which to extract nucleic acids for molecular analysis . FFPE specimens contain a high quantity of material for both morphological evaluation and ancillary techniques and do not require additional molecular validation, unlike cytological samples . This procedure supports the correct management of aspirated material for morphomolecular analysis . The major limitation of cytological samples is the necessity for careful validation of techniques before they are implemented in clinical practice . Moreover, despite the high-quality sampling of nucleic acids, these preparations have low quantities of material available for analysis and there is a high risk that diagnostic material will be lost . Cell blocks are cytological preparations that resemble histological samples . Consequently, cell blocks have advantages and disadvantages similar to those of histological samples . How to report . Molecular reports are a crucial part of molecular laboratories' workflow . They should contain all relevant information to support the clinician's management of the patient, particularly regarding the best treatment choice . Incomplete or difficult to understand reports may lead to errors in patient management . Molecular reports should be short and easy to interpret, focusing on the main information that could be of interest for the patient's clinical management . All reports should show the patient's unique identifiers (name, surname, date of birth and identification number) . In addition, it is important to report the . sample type . As recommended by the AMP, ASCO and CAP, a four-tiered system for the interpretation and reporting of variants in cancer should be adopted, in particular when tested using large NGS panels (Table 6.3) . According to the guidance from the professional bodies, tiers I-III variants should be reported, but it is not always necessary to report tier IV variants . Gene rearrangements should be reported by indicating both genes involved (for example, EML4 / ALK fusion) . It is also important to report as 'wild type' the absence of mutations in clinically relevant genes (tier I) . The report should contain a clinical interpretation of the detected variants to suggest treatment options, with literature citations where possible . In particular, clinicians may have had limited training in molecular biology while molecular pathologists may have low awareness of clinical management . Molecular tumor boards are multidisciplinary groups of professionals involved in the management of cancer patients, such as molecular pathologists, clinicians, surgeons, radiologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians and biologists . There are 6-40 members at each meeting . At each meeting, the MTB discusses the correct management of individual cancer patients . It is the role of the MTB to decipher the complexity of the cancer genomic landscape and translate it into information useful for patient management . As well as therapeutic strategies, the meeting provides an opportunity to solve other kinds of problems, such as the type of sample that should be analyzed, the molecular technique and gene panel that should be adopted and the interpretation of molecular results, which is particularly important when unclear or doubtful data have been reported . Owing to the complexity of each cancer patient, MTBs generally discuss two or three patients per meeting . First, there should be global harmonization in cancer sequencing practices and procedures . Costs/reimbursement . Costs and reimbursements are crucially important for molecular pathology laboratories offering predictive assays . With NGS testing using the Ion Torrent platform (see page 34), 504 mutational hotspot regions in 22 genes can be tested simultaneously for 8 patients using a single 316 chip . In this case, the cost for each patient's analysis was calculated as €187.23 . reported that the cost of NGS analysis could be reduced by adopting a narrow custom gene panel covering 568 hotspot mutations in six genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, KIT and PDGFRA) . In addition, the protocol was optimized to run 16 patient samples in a single 316 chip . These modifications reduced the cost to €98 per sample, similar to the cost of a traditional RT-PCR test . Besides the different gene panels and platforms, it is important to consider the healthcare system in which these technologies are adopted and the reimbursement system for molecular tests . Careful attention should be paid to ensuring that the molecular data that can represent the standard of care for cancer patients, at the very least, can be gained . In addition, costs rise if a large number of laboratories perform molecular tests on a relatively low number of samples . 
Although the vast majority of these tumors are benign or low-grade, anaplastic variants and malignant degeneration of initially low-grade tumors have been described . All types of seizures may occur, including simple and complex partial seizures, and generalized seizures . When these tumors arise in other areas of the central nervous system they can produce a variety of symptoms, dependent on their location . The CT and MRI features of gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas are striking . MRI reveals a hypointense lesion with variable contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images, and a hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted images (Figure 7.2) . The initial management of gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas is surgery, with the goal of gross total resection of all accessible hemispheric tumors . Resection of these tumors can improve epilepsy, and approximately 68% of patients with epilepsy who undergo complete resection of their tumors become seizure-free . The role of radiotherapy in managing these tumors is controversial . Some experts recommend radiotherapy for midline gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas and for tumors with an anaplastic glial element, based on retrospective data suggesting a worse outcome for these subsets of patients . Radiotherapy is also often administered at recurrence, but even in this situation, the initial approach is reoperation . Central neurocytoma . Previously, these tumors were classified as intraventricular oligodendrogliomas or intraventricular ependymomas . In most cases, they are slow-growing neoplasms, but some tumors can be clinically aggressive . These tumors usually present in individuals aged 20-40 years . Symptoms are typically due to hydrocephalus, and include headaches, nausea and vomiting, and diplopia . Characteristically, the enhancing border of the tumor is sharply demarcated from the surrounding ventricles . If there is recurrence, reoperation is indicated and radiotherapy should be considered, particularly if the recurrence was rapid . Dysplastic gangliocytoma is a rare disorder combining neoplastic and malformative features . The most common symptoms are those due to hydrocephalus and cerebellar dysfunction . Patients often have other malformations, including polydactyly and multiple hemangiomas . Contrast enhancement is not a typical feature . Radical resection of the mass lesion is the treatment of choice . In addition, ventriculoperitoneal shunting is often necessary to manage the symptoms of hydrocephalus . Although resection is often subtotal, persistence of a residual lesion may not adversely affect outcome . This lesion is very indolent, and there is no established role for radiotherapy or chemotherapy . These lesions have combined hamartomatous and neoplastic characteristics, and are frequently located in temporal lobes . They have been identified in individuals of various ages, although most patients present in early childhood with epilepsy . MRI reveals a cortically situated and well-demarcated lesion that is hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images . Surgical resection of the lesion is the only indicated treatment and, in the vast majority of patients, this cures the epileptic seizures . This type of tumor is very rare, with only a few dozen cases having been reported to date, all in infants and young children . Patients typically present with an enlarged head and other features of hydrocephalus, and also seizures . These tumors are confined to the cerebral hemispheres, and MRI usually reveals a massive multicystic multilobulated mass with a solid component extending to the cortical surface . As with all glial-neuronal tumors, initial management comprises maximal surgical resection of the tumor . Subsequent management is not clear . Postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy has often been administered following subtotal resection, because the tumor has the potential for aggressive biological behavior . For patients undergoing macroscopically radical resections, further immediate therapy can be withheld because the prognosis associated with this tumor is usually good . Neuronal tumors . Neuronal tumors are very uncommon brain neoplasms that tend to affect children and young adults (Table 7.1) . There are often few signs and symptoms other than intractable epilepsy . 
Is schizophrenia a degenerative brain disorder, as originally thought by Kraepelin, or is it better viewed as non-progressive? . During the 1990s, much attention was given to the 'neurodevelopmental hypothesis' of schizophrenia . On the basis of the range of observations outlined in Table 5.1, it was suggested that a static lesion, either genetic or environmental in origin during brain development, expressed its effects as a function of the maturational stage of the brain . In schizophrenia, the characteristic symptoms emerge only during the final stages of brain development in adolescence, when normal 'pruning' or elimination of excess synapses takes place . It is now known that schizophrenia results in part from a developmentally regulated disconnection of higher order association areas, through alterations in neuronal migration, synapse formation and myelination . Neurodevelopmental risk factors . Some established risk factors act early in life (Table 5.2) . Obstetric complications generally appear to increase the risk of schizophrenia . During pregnancy, risk factors include rubella and influenza infections in the first or second trimester and antepartum bleeding . Asphyxia and low birth weight, especially with intrauterine growth retardation, are risk factors at birth, as are certain brain insults and infections in childhood . Early developmental delays . Longitudinal follow-up studies of large birth cohorts have shown that the 1-2% of the sample who go on to develop adult schizophrenia show slight delays in motor, speech and intellectual milestones compared with the rest of the cohort . Certain problems, such as developmental receptive language disorders, are particularly linked to later schizophrenia . Secondary schizophrenias . The so-called secondary schizophrenias fit less easily into the neurodevelopmental formulation . The psychotic symptoms in these cases appear to be caused by a primary organic disorder, either a known physical disorder or a clinically unsuspected brain lesion . Table 5.3 lists those medical conditions in which a clear or possible association with schizophrenia-like disorders has been reported . Antineuronal cell surface antibody disorders involving the N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor can present with psychosis, which responds to immunotherapy . These disorders are more common than previously realized, accounting for perhaps 2-3% of first-onset cases . Clinically recommended screening investigations for first-episode schizophrenia are outlined in Table 5.4 . Use of cannabis and amphetamine-like drugs has long been known to be an important trigger of relapse, but had not been thought to directly cause the onset of illness . However, several cohort studies since 2000 have shown that use of cannabis doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia . The risk is further increased if minor psychotic symptoms pre-exist and if cannabis use starts early in adolescence . Research suggests that this effect of cannabis may be mediated by a particular gene . Those with a specific version of the catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene, carried by about a quarter of the general population, appear to be especially prone to psychosis after cannabis use . Delta-9-THC, the active component of cannabis, disrupts learning and recall in schizophrenia . Psychosocial risk factors . There is emerging evidence for the role of non-biological risk factors in schizophrenia, such as the effects of urban upbringing and of ethnicity, as noted in Chapter 3 . 
Although asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders it is often underdiagnosed, especially in older people . An accurate diagnosis is essential for effective asthma control . The clinical diagnosis of asthma is often based on the presence of symptoms such as . Various symptom scoring scales have been developed to monitor the occurrence and severity of symptoms . Asthma symptoms vary during the day, and the respiratory system may appear normal on physical examination . The absence of wheezing is not sufficient to preclude a diagnosis of asthma . Measurements of lung function . Patients with asthma often have poor recognition of their symptoms and poor perception of symptom severity . Measurements of lung function provide an objective assessment of airflow limitation, and its variability and reversibility, and thus are valuable in the diagnosis and management of asthma . They can be used both for the diagnosis of asthma in the clinic (Table 3.3) and to monitor asthma in the home . PEF readings can also indicate to an individual the severity of their asthma when compared with previous readings, enabling institution of a self-management plan . Daily variability of more than 20% indicates asthma . Measurement of bronchial responsiveness . A standardized exercise test has also found use, especially in young children with suspected asthma . Measurement of airway inflammation . Asthma can also be classified according to the inflammation found in the airways . The concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air can be used as a surrogate measure for airway inflammation in asthma . In allergic asthma, high levels of exhaled NO may also suggest ongoing allergen exposure . Exhaled NO levels are generally highly sensitive to corticosteroid treatments, but in corticosteroid-naive patients high levels of NO may be used to support a diagnosis of asthma, while low levels render an asthma diagnosis less likely . Allergen skin-prick tests and other tests for atopy . For the diagnosis of asthma, the results should always be interpreted in relation to the patient's history and the relationship between asthma symptoms and allergen exposure, because up to 45% of the population may exhibit atopy but only a proportion of these individuals will have asthma . Patient groups . The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult in certain patient groups, especially smokers and the extremely young or old, who may have difficulty performing lung function tests . Individuals with other lung disease may also provide a mixed pattern on spirometry testing . Asthma in older people . A history of asthma in childhood and variability on spirometry or PEF testing with beta -agonists supports the diagnosis . Occupational asthma is also often misdiagnosed as chronic bronchitis or COPD . Seasonal asthma associated with very high levels of aeroallergens may present as intermittent symptoms, with the patient being asymptomatic between seasons, or as seasonal worsening of moderate or severe asthma . Cough-variant asthma . Patients present with cough as the principal symptom; they seldom wheeze . Lung function tests and measurement of bronchial responsiveness with some form of challenge test are particularly important in these patients . The keys to diagnosing asthma are the patient's history together with measurements of lung function through spirometry and airway variability . An obstructive ventilatory defect alone suggests asthma or COPD while excluding other conditions . In adults, asthma-like symptoms can result from bronchitis or COPD; concomitant asthma and COPD are common among past or present smokers, and even occur in some individuals who have never smoked . Demonstration of reversible and variable airflow limitation confirms the diagnosis of asthma and indicates a trial of preventive treatment . Classification of asthma severity . A combination of symptom measurements and lung function tests can be used to classify asthma according to its severity (Figure 3.5) . However, classification of asthma by severity is not necessarily predictive of the amount or types of treatment required to achieve best asthma outcomes . There is also often a lack of lung function measurements to provide more objective information . It is important to recognize that even mild asthma can be associated with severe, potentially fatal exacerbations . Risk factors that have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of death from asthma include . hospitalization for asthma within the previous year . a history of invasive ventilation for asthma . difficulty accessing treatment . Conversely, a written asthma action plan has been found to be protective against asthma death . 
Food is metabolized and converted to energy, which is used in . The easiest way to reduce energy intake is to reduce the energy density of the diet . Maintenance of weight loss is therefore critically dependent on physical activity . The importance of adherence . Dietary approaches to weight management . Most of these popular diets have been found to modestly reduce bodyweight and several cardiac risk factors at 1 year . Any change in the pattern of eating that reduces energy intake will result in weight loss . In general, most energy-dense foods are high-fat foods (often dry foods), whereas most foods that contain a lot of water (exempli gratia fruits, vegetables, soups) have a low energy density . After oxidation, fat generates 9 kcal/g, while carbohydrate and protein generate 4 kcal/g . For healthy long-term weight loss and weight maintenance, the food selected should have a high nutrient density but low energy density . Standard calorie-restricted diet . High-fat foods are relatively less satiating than iso-energetic portions of high-protein foods or carbohydrate-containing foods with a high fiber content . Many epidemiological studies have shown that a relatively high intake of dietary fat, in particular saturated (animal) fat, corresponds with increased obesity . Reducing intake of saturated fat and refined carbohydrates facilitates weight loss and forms the basis of the most standard dietary approach . Protein and dairy products . misguided consumption of highly processed carbohydrate-rich energy-dense foods that are marketed as 'low fat' . They also reduce cardiovascular events in high-risk patients . Low-fat, modified-carbohydrate diets . Accordingly, when recommending a low-fat diet it is important to ensure that the carbohydrate consumed is appropriate, and that highly processed and low-fiber foods are avoided . Patients should understand that many foods promoted as 'low fat' are high in carbohydrate and low in fiber, and are therefore best avoided . Increased intake of protein relative to carbohydrate . increased satiety . increased thermogenesis . Examples of diets based on these principles include the Zone, South Beach and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Total Wellbeing diets . In these diets, energy intake is derived from approximately . The metabolic benefits of this dietary approach include lower plasma triglyceride levels and reduced postprandial blood glucose levels . Very-low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet . This type of diet contributes less than 10% kcal per day as fat, is high in carbohydrate and has a moderate protein content . The Ornish diet is based on plant-based foods that are low in fat and high in complex carbohydrates and fiber; less than 10% of the energy intake should be from fat . The Pritikin diet is similarly low in fat (5-10% of energy), cholesterol, protein (10-15%) and highly refined carbohydrates but is high in complex carbohydrates (80%) . Besides weight loss, these diets have the greatest effect in decreasing serum cholesterol concentrations and thus the risk for heart disease . High-fat, low-carbohydrate diet . This type of diet, for example the widely publicized (and studied) Atkins diet, characteristically contains less than 20-30 g of carbohydrate per day, has a high fat content (55-65%) and relatively high protein content . The Dukan diet is popular in Europe . These diets gained public acceptance because of the rapid weight loss and decreased hunger . Very-low-calorie diets and meal replacements . VLCDs also reduce comorbidities associated with obesity . In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose can often be normalized . This type of diet may also decrease gastroesophageal reflux . Supplemental low-calorie diet or 'modified' VLCD approaches permit one small meal each day . It is important that added foods are very low in carbohydrate, as consumption of carbohydrate will produce severe hunger, and control will almost certainly be lost . Intermittent use of VLCD . Approaches include . reintroduction of the VLCD when bodyweight increases to a predetermined level . Meal replacements . In obese subjects, diets with meal replacements have proven more effective than conventional diets . Meal replacements offer a promising strategy for treating obese patients with type 2 diabetes . Commercial weight loss programs . 
Men with CRPC are a heterogeneous group, ranging from men with increasing PSA only and no demonstrable metastases to those who have many bone and/or visceral metastases (Figure 8.2), pain and poor functional status . Historically, therapy had little effect beyond modest palliation . Some of the trials with important results for the treatment of CRPC are summarized in Table 8.1 . This may transiently reduce PSA, but the PSA will usually start to rise again relatively soon . Estrogen treatment may benefit some men with CRPC . It appears to have two effects . direct cytotoxic effect on the tumor . Traditionally, treatment has been either further hormonal manipulation, as described above, or treatment within a clinical trial . Once these fail, however, an observational approach is taken until the patient develops demonstrable metastases (M1 CRPC) for which further treatments are available (see below) . Although a number of therapies, such as the endothelin antagonists atrasentan and zibotentan, have been trialed, none has been effective in delaying the progression of M0 CRPC to M1 CRPC . Metastatic (M1) castrate-resistant prostate cancer . Abiraterone is approved as first-line treatment for metastatic CRPC . Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor, approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC either prior to chemotherapy or after previous docetaxel treatment . Radium-223 delivers targeted alpha therapy to bones . It is approved for the treatment of CRPC in men with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease . As alpha particles have limited penetration, radium-223 delivers highly localized therapy, killing tumor cells but with minimal damage to surrounding tissue . Second-line therapy . Treatment options when prostate cancer progresses after docetaxel chemotherapy include further chemotherapy, one of the new hormonal modulation agents or targeted alpha therapy . This taxane chemotherapy was developed to overcome the resistance that can develop as a result of docetaxel treatment . In the TROPIC study, men with CRPC that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomized to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone . Side effects were similar to those seen with docetaxel . It also improved the quality of life of men with CRPC . In the AFFIRM trial, oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, improved survival in men with metastatic CRPC after failure of docetaxel chemotherapy (see Table 8.1) . Radium-223 delivers targeted alpha therapy to bones, delaying symptomatic skeletal and skeletal-related events . Therapies that modulate the immune system are showing considerable promise in trials of CRPC . These therapies take time to mediate an effect and are therefore best used in men with minimal or no symptoms . In a phase III trial of men with CRPC not previously treated with docetaxel, treatment with sipuleucel-T resulted in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death compared with placebo, with minimal side effects (see Table 8.1) . Significant tumor responses with ipilimumab were seen in a phase II trial in men with metastatic CRPC . This immunotherapy is currently in phase III trials . These vaccines stimulate an antigen-presenting cell-mediated immune response to PSA-expressing tumor cells . Bone pain is one of the most intractable problems associated with CRPC, and conventional analgesics do not always provide relief . However, some men do not get full resolution of pain, or may have painful bone metastases in the setting of CRPC . Focal external-beam radiotherapy is a well-established treatment, providing rapid improvement in pain in up to 80% of men . Wide-field radiation may also be useful in patients with intractable diffuse pain . A randomized trial involving 1904 men with CRPC supported denosumab as the optimal medication to reduce bone-related events in men with CRPC (see Table 8.1) . Despite improving therapies, most patients with CRPC eventually die as a result of the cancer, often within 12-24 months . Treatment with high-dose steroids can sometimes provide useful palliation . Treatment algorithm . A suggested algorithm for the treatment of CRPC is presented in Figure 8.7 . 
JAK inhibitors . Several JAK inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with myelofibrosis . The efficacy of this agent in patients with myelofibrosis has been evaluated in two randomized Phase III trials: PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 . PERSIST-1 excluded patients who had previously received JAK2 inhibitors whereas such patients were eligible to enter PERSIST-2 . Fedratinib is a JAK2 inhibitor that provided significant improvements in symptom scores and spleen volume in trials involving patients with myelofibrosis . Clinical development was temporarily halted because of concerns about Wernicke's encephalopathy (eight cases among 877 patients across 18 studies) . In the JAKARTA2 study involving with patients with myelofibrosis following failure of ruxolitinib, 46 of 83 assessable patients showed a spleen response . The efficacy and safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b has been investigated in the randomized PROUD-PV study, which involved 254 patients with PV, and the follow-up CONTI-PV study . The PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) was not effective in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis . Several HDAC inhibitors have been evaluated in patients with MPNs . Panobinostat showed good efficacy and tolerability in a Phase I study in patients with myelofibrosis, and is currently being evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in Phase I/II trials . Clinical activity has been reported in a Phase IIa study in patients with ET or PV, and a study in patients with PV refractory to, or intolerance of, hydroxyurea . In a Phase II study involving 22 patients with myelofibrosis, 36% showed some clinical benefit and 27% had a reduction in splenomegaly . A large study of givinostat in patients with newly diagnosed PV is planned . Hedgehog pathway inhibitors . Abnormalities in hedgehog pathway signaling have been described in animal models of myelofibrosis but most trials with inhibitors of this pathway in patients with MPN have not shown any benefit . Other studies have suggested that treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor may enhance the efficacy of hypomethylating agents in patients with myelofibrosis or MPN blast phase . Telomerase inhibitors . In a study with the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat, involving 33 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, complete or partial responses were achieved in 21% . All four patients who had complete responses also showed reductions in bone marrow fibrosis . However, a Phase II study in patients with relapsed or refractory myelofibrosis following treatment with ruxolitinib has been suspended . Inhibitors of bone marrow fibrosis . Reductions in fibrosis, hemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements have been reported in a Phase II study in patients with myelofibrosis who received recombinant human pentraxin-2 (PRM-151) in combination with ruxolitinib . A study of PRM-151 in patients refractory to, intolerant of or ineligible for ruxolitinib is in progress . Erythropoiesis inhibitor blockers . The safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with myelofibrosis and anemia are currently being investigated in a Phase II open-label study . Sotatercept has shown promising efficacy and tolerability in a Phase II dose-ranging study in patients with MDS, and it is currently being investigated in a Phase II open-label study in patients with MPN-related myelofibrosis and anemia . MDM2 inhibitors . The MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin is currently being evaluated in a number of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, and in patients with ET or PV . The Bcl-2 antagonist obatoclax mesylate showed limited efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies or myelofibrosis . Another Bcl-2 inhibitor, navitoclax, is currently being evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in an open-label study in patients with myelofibrosis . Combination therapy . However, this approach raises a number of questions regarding the most appropriate clinical trial design, particularly in terms of patient selection and clinical endpoints . 
Examples of gene therapies with track records of clinical efficacy are described in the following sections and summarized in Table 4.2 . Prior to gene therapy, no treatment was available for certain forms of hereditary blindness . However, the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to transduce retinal cells on subretinal administration has enabled the development of therapies for such diseases . This effort ultimately led to the first gene therapy drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of a genetic disease in late 2017 . This improvement was stable for at least 3 years . One protocol was successfully expanded to pediatric patients . As perhaps expected, functional gains from gene transfer to the second eye were more pronounced in younger patients . Children receiving the gene therapy experienced vast improvements in their quality of life, such as being able to attend school or participate in sports . Success with LCA2 gene therapy has generated interest in developing gene therapy for other retinal diseases . For instance, successful outcomes of a gene therapy trial for choroideremia have been reported . Thus, absence of functional REP-1 may lead to early cell death . Importantly, subretinal gene transfer with an AAV2 vector carrying the CHM gene substantially improved vision in two patients and increased retinal sensitivity in four more patients . To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1 . The FDA has approved the systemic AAV gene therapy for SMN1-deficient children up to the age of 2 years . Engraftment of gene-corrected cells was successful in bone marrow and peripheral blood . Stable reconstitution of ARSA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid can be achieved within 6 months after gene therapy . Primary immune deficiencies: severe combined immune deficiencies . However, compatible donors are typically found for fewer than 20% of patients . Therefore, T cells are absent, B-cell function is impaired and natural killer (NK) cells fail to develop . Retrovirally transduced HSCs effectively restore immune function . Because of the strong selective advantage of gene-corrected cells, there is no need for bone marrow conditioning . However, development of leukemia in six of the 20 patients studied emerged as a major setback in these trials . Interestingly, ADA-SCID was the target for the very first gene therapy trial in 1990 . Remarkably, gene therapy essentially resulted in a cure, with gene correction in multiple cell lineages, ADA expression at normal levels and restoration of immune competence . Hence, the gene therapy product for ADA-SCID obtained marketing approval from the EMA . Additional insights emerged from the cumulative experience with gene therapy for ADA-SCID . ERT does not appear to reduce the selective advantage of gene-corrected cells and may have synergistic effects with gene transfer . It is possible that, compared with the blood and other organs, ADA delivery to the brain is limited following gene therapy, or that some irreversible damage to the CNS has already occurred prior to gene therapy . Disease severity correlates with residual coagulation activity . In contrast, gene therapy has the potential to be curative, lasting for many years after a single round of gene transfer (> 10 years in canine models) . Such vectors raised coagulation activity in patients with severe disease to around 30-50% of usual levels, close to the lower limit of the normal range . Two products expressing FIX-Padua have been developed . Several more vectors are being tested for hemophilia A and B, based on diverse capsids . Current gene therapies for hemophilia are exclusively for adults, and debate is ongoing whether gene transfer should also be offered to pediatric patients . Cancer gene therapy . CAR-T therapy for lymphoma and leukemia . Adoptive lymphocyte therapy using gene-modified autologous T cells is one of the technologies revolutionizing cancer therapy . Three of four patients experienced severe adverse events related to treatment, and about half developed severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS; see page 50) . Also in 2017, the first CAR-T cell therapy was approved for the treatment of DLBCL . More recent CAR-T cell therapies with potentially reduced toxicities are being evaluated in clinical trials . Other cancer gene therapies . In the case of melanoma, these may be genetically engineered and thus can also be considered a type of gene therapy . 
Not to broach the subject of excess weight with a patient is a dereliction of duty as a health professional . The initial conversation . Patients who smoke are rapidly identified for intervention, and the same should be true of anyone who is obese, with clinicians obtaining appropriate measurements on a routine basis . The initial conversation should . inform the patient of his/her bodyweight in relation to health standards . clearly convey the health risks associated with excess weight (see The health risks of excess weight) . explore the patient's willingness to consider a weight-loss program . ascertain the level of support the patient has (exempli gratia from family and friends) . establish practical lifestyle changes and short-term goals appropriate to the individual's circumstances . A patient attending a diabetes or cardiovascular clinic can be asked whether they have lost or gained weight recently . Any patient can be offered a 'well patient check' during a consultation, which will include measurement of weight, height and waist circumference . Assessing level of engagement . It is also important to ascertain the patient's expectations in terms of weight loss and whether these are realistic . Just because a patient is not ready to lose weight does not mean they are not interested in improving their health . The examination should include measurement of height, weight and waist circumference (see Assessment of body fat) . Body fat analysis is optional but is useful for identifying patients with a normal body mass index (BMI) but high percentage of fat and for monitoring progress, in particular providing encouragement to patients who are improving their health by increased activity but who fail to lose weight . The presence of any dysmorphic features should be noted, as these may suggest the presence of an obesity syndrome . Measurement of blood pressure, using an appropriately sized cuff, is important . BMI = Weight (kg) . For individual adults, however, BMI can be misleading, and it is inaccurate as a predictor of disease . BMI is a crude measure of a person's size and fails to differentiate between the various body morphologies that confer varying degrees of risk . Conversely, individuals with skinny legs and arms and a pot belly have a 'normal' BMI despite a high fat mass . These individuals are at high risk of cardiovascular disease, frailty and disability with increasing age . Thus, BMI is not the ideal measure for clinical practice, and is not suitable as a self-assessment tool . This also serves to highlight the importance of ethnic-specific criteria for assessment of obesity and associated risk . Correct measurement is shown in Figure 1.1 . Measurements are reproducible with little practice and provide a tangible figure: 102 cm (40 inches) is a meaningful term compared with the abstract score of BMI . Patients can easily measure waist circumference themselves . Waist circumference has gained recognition as a more accurate indicator of cardiometabolic risk than BMI, and is being increasingly embraced in routine medical practice . Definitions of overweight and obesity in terms of waist circumference are given in Table 1.3 . Even if the patient's BMI is normal, the clinician has a responsibility to undertake appropriate risk management . Measurement of blood pressure and evaluation of the blood lipid profile and blood glucose is mandatory in such individuals . Waist circumference is also a useful and tangible marker of weight loss (or gain) for patients . Measurement is unnecessary for routine clinical practice, and it is not suitable as a self-assessment tool as it involves two measurements and a calculation . In the elderly, the hip measurement provides some adjustment for lean body mass . BIA gives additional information over and above simple biometric measures, by assessing body composition . Fat increases the resistance, hence the lean:fat ratio can be calculated . This measure can be motivational in patients who become more active and improve their body composition without actually losing weight . It can be assessed using relatively inexpensive stand-on scales and is appropriate for use in obesity clinics, or by patients in their own homes . Other assessments . Predicting risk . Waist circumference is a better predictor of risk of cardiometabolic disease (cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus) than BMI . Other studies have demonstrated that BMI is a much less accurate indicator of risk than WHR or waist circumference, for instance in type 2 diabetes mellitus . WHR of 0.85 or less is associated with a low risk compared with WHR of 1 or more, irrespective of BMI .
