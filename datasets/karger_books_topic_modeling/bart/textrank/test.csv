9783318068207,hh-7,"demonstrated, for the first time, that gefitinib, a first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKI, was more effective than carboplatin-paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations (12-month PFS 24.9% versus 6.7%, respectively) . Despite the low number, patients with an ALK fusion have been shown to respond well to the first-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- fusion TKI crizotinib when compared with chemotherapy (PFS 10.9 months versus 7.0 months and objective response rate [ORR] 74% versus 45%), with a significant improvement in quality of life . More recently, in the STARTRK-1 Phase I clinical trial, the tyrosine kinase multi-inhibitor entrectinib has shown promising results in patients with ROS1 rearrangements . The recent successes with a PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of PIK3CA -mutated hormone receptor (HR)-positive mBC and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in deleterious germline BRCA1 / -mutated mBC have solidified the role of genomic testing to guide therapy for patients with mBC . Here, we will discuss only those classified as tier I-A (prospective randomized clinical trials show the alteration-drug match in a specific tumor type results in a clinically meaningful improvement in a survival endpoint) according to the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) or level 1 (FDA-recognized biomarker predictive of response to an FDA-approved drug in this indication - see Chapter 4) by the precision oncology knowledge base OncoKB . The Phase III randomized SOLAR-1 trial compared the combination of the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib and fulvestrant with fulvestrant alone in patients with HR-positive HER2 -negative mBC who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy . The randomized OlympiAD trial compared olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, with single-agent chemotherapy in patients with HER2 -negative mBC who harbored a germline BRCA1 / mutation . On the basis of this study, olaparib received FDA approval for the treatment of HER2 -negative mBC with germline BRCA1 / mutations in patients previously treated with chemotherapy . Similarly, the Phase III EMBRACA trial compared the PARP inhibitor talazoparib with single-agent chemotherapy in patients with mBC harboring germline BRCA1 / mutations . On the basis of this study, talazoparib received FDA approval for the treatment of HER2 -negative mBC with germline BRCA1 / mutations, regardless of prior chemotherapy use . Two Trk inhibitors, larotrectinib and entrectinib, have gained FDA approval for the treatment of solid tumors that harbor an NTRK gene fusion . Anti-EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, can be beneficial in patients with metastatic CRC provided that there is no downstream mutation activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway . The group of potentially benefiting patients has now been expanded to include patients with high TMB, which is emerging as an important predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs in the subset of MMR-deficient (MSI-H) CRC . Trametinib is an oral, small molecule, selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 that was approved by the FDA in 2013 for melanoma patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF p . The majority of patients with metastatic melanoma who present with the activating BRAF mutation (p .","The molecular status of, at least, EGFR, ALK, ROS1 and BRAF must be tested in patients with advanced stage NSCLC to determine suitability for TKI therapy. PD-L1 expression also needs to be tested in patients with advanced NSCLC to guide immunotherapy decisions. Knowledge of mutations affecting KRAS, MET, RET and NTRK may also help select treatment for advanced NSCLC. Individuals with advanced breast cancer should undergo molecular testing to assess, at least, PIK3CA (ER+ mBC), germinal BRCA mutations ( HER2 âˆ’ mBC), HER2 amplification, MSI and NTRK. Knowledge of PD-L1 expression is also required to guide immunotherapy in TNBC. The utility of assessing several other genes ( ESR1, AKT1, PTEN and HER2 ) and the value of assessing TMB are currently being investigated in breast cancer. Chromosomal instability accounts for around 85% of all CRCs, while MSI accounts for around 15%. CIMP, which shows overlap with the MSI pathway, is found in around 17% of CRCs. The minimum testing required to determine whether anti-EGFR therapy may be of benefit in CRC is extended RAS testing of KRAS and NRAS: codons 12 and 13 of exon 2; codons 59 and 61 of exon 3; and codons 117 and 146 of exon 4. Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations - including BRAF, NRAS and KIT - documented in all melanoma subtypes. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations. BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma; however, these responses may be short. The combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors has demonstrated improved durable response rates over a single-agent BRAF inhibitor. Mucosal or acral melanomas with activating mutations or amplifications in KIT may be sensitive to c-KIT inhibitors. The majority of GISTs have KIT mutations that result in constitutive activation of the RTK, c-KIT. TKIs have some effectiveness in GISTs and non-GI sarcomas."
9781910797631,chp6,"Overall, findings from trials conducted in a range of settings indicate that preventive interventions may reduce the incidence of depressive disorders by around 20% compared with treatment-as-usual control groups . Low participation rates in depression prevention programs have been noted as a problem, but it seems likely that the increased use of communications technologies such as mobile phones and the internet, together with appropriate marketing approaches, will enhance involvement . These management problems relate to the availability, acceptability and effectiveness of current treatments for depression: although considerable progress has been made over recent decades, difficulties and limitations remain in all these areas . Many presentations of depressive symptoms are likely to be relatively short lived and uncomplicated: spontaneous remission and placebo response are relatively common, with around 30% of people improving without active treatment or showing response to inactive management approaches . If a depressive episode of mild to moderate severity develops, the first options for treatment should include low-intensity interventions such as guided self-help, activity scheduling, brief psychological interventions, supervised exercise programs and computerized CBT . These materials are based on evidence, usually a cognitive-behavioral approach, and may involve guidance and support from a health professional (guided self-help), which can be delivered individually or in a group setting . Several systematic reviews have indicated this approach to be effective in reducing depression scores in comparison with waiting-list controls or treatment as usual, and that effectiveness is maintained even where there is minimal contact with a professional or the resources are entirely self-administered . Additionally, observational studies commonly find that people self-report that they use exercise to avoid depressive symptoms and prevent relapse, although robust evidence to support these claims is currently lacking . The most recent Cochrane review () based on 39 randomized trials found that physical exercise improves depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosis of mild or moderate depression, but the extent of the effect diminishes to borderline significance when evidence from only the six most robust trials is used . While current evidence indicates that exercise is superior to waiting-list or no-treatment controls, findings are inconclusive concerning equivalence or superiority to either antidepressants or psychological therapy . Important questions remain concerning the most effective type, frequency and duration of exercise: the studies that comprise the evidence base involve a wide range of types of physical activity conducted for periods from 10 days to 16 weeks, conducted indoors and outdoors, and including both individual and group approaches, and supervised and unsupervised delivery . Although encouragement of any increase in physical activity is likely to be useful for people with depression, current evidence indicates that a regular program of activity is necessary for maintenance of effects . Evaluations of a range of computer- and internet-based CBT programs indicate significant improvements in the symptoms of depression compared with control patients . Systematic reviews conducted for recent clinical guidelines indicate that, for people with depression, including those with comorbid physical illness, SSRIs are an appropriate first-line treatment . Switching between antidepressants because of poor response to initial treatment is more likely to be needed for people with more chronic depression and more coexisting health problems .","The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods. Depression is complex, and understanding and helping requires a sensitive weighing up of the many factors that are relevant to the individuals and families affected. There are a range of treatments that may be effective for depression, and matching management intensity to the level of depression severity - termed 'stepped care' - is a widely adopted framework for care. For milder forms of depression, self-help, relaxation, sleep hygiene, exercise and problem-solving therapy are likely to be effective; for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants or a structured psychological treatment (cognitive-behavior therapy) is indicated; combined antidepressants and psychological therapy may be most appropriate for severe depression. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the first-choice medication but prior treatment history, medical history and drug interactions are key considerations in treatment selection."
9781910797426,ch03,"Acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammatory condition that occurs in patients without gallstones . Non-visualization of the gallbladder is diagnostic of acute cholecystitis, but false-positive HIDA findings may occur in a variety of conditions . Most patients with gallbladder polyps are asymptomatic, with discovery usually being incidental on imaging studies, although some patients may present with chronic and recurrent biliary-type pain . Computed tomography is not useful for the detection or differential diagnosis of small gallbladder polyps . Cholecystectomy is indicated for polyps greater than 1 cm, for polyps with associated gallstones and for patients with biliary symptoms . Inflammation may occur as a result of gallstones, gallbladder polyps, chronic Salmonella infection, congenital biliary cysts, abnormal pancreaticobiliary duct junction, carcinogen exposure and certain drugs . Symptoms and signs include abdominal pain (usually in the right upper quadrant), weight loss, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fever, obstructive jaundice (from invasion of the bile duct) and duodenal obstruction . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography are not needed routinely unless the patient presents with obstructive jaundice requiring biliary decompression, without an obvious diagnosis of gallbladder cancer . Endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in regional staging of gallbladder cancer associated with lymph-node metastases and vascular invasion . Symptoms may arise from acute or chronic cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis (see Chapter 4), and some patients present with mild symptoms of intermittent right upper quadrant pain (biliary colic); these patients are at increased risk of gallstone-related complications . Air in the biliary tree suggests an abnormal communication (fistula) between the gallbladder and bowel (usually the duodenum); air in the gallbladder wall (sometimes accompanied by an air-fluid level) indicates emphysematous acute cholecystitis (often in association with diabetes mellitus); and, rarely, a calcified ('porcelain') gallbladder indicates a premalignant condition . Surgical treatment of symptomatic gallstones and their major complications (acute or chronic cholecystitis, etc . by cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment for gallstone disease, usually by the laparoscopic route . Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the definitive treatment for gallstone disease, selected patients who are unfit for surgery may be candidates for medical therapy . This treatment is most successful for small stones in a normally functioning gallbladder and in the absence of acute cholecystitis . If the gallstones are causing obstruction, they can lead to blockage of the cystic duct with biliary type pain or acute cholecystitis (see below) . Acute cholecystitis caused by gallstones is in most cases due to obstruction of the cystic duct, which results in distension and inflammation of the gallbladder wall, which in turn may result in ischemia and necrosis . Transabdominal ultrasonography is the most useful test for acute cholecystitis as it establishes the presence of gallstones (Figure 3.5) . A thickened gallbladder wall (> 4 mm) and pericholecystic fluid are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.6) . Gallstones are the causative agent in the majority of patients with chronic cholecystitis . Endoscopic ultrasonography may be used in patients with chronic biliary-type pain who have no gallstones on transabdominal ultrasound .","The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age, and women are at higher risk than men. Transabdominal ultrasound is the imaging test of choice, with an accuracy of over 95%, for the diagnosis of gallstones in either acute or chronic cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Acalculous cholecystitis may occur in critically ill patients; the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Patients with gallbladder polyps more than 1 cm in size should be considered for cholecystectomy owing to the increased risk of malignancy. Gallbladder cancer is the most common gastrointestinal cancer in Native Americans in the USA and also has a very high incidence in certain Latin American countries, particularly Chile."
9781908541277,ch_9,"Surgery should be considered for patients with drug-resistant seizures because of the increased mortality and progressive cognitive and psychosocial morbidities associated with uncontrolled seizures over many years . In addition to results of diagnostic tests, the patient's and the family's perceptions of epilepsy severity despite optimal pharmacotherapy and their expectations for the future are key determinants in the decision to operate . Corpus callosotomy is a treatment option for patients with severe generalized epilepsy, particularly atonic seizures with frequent falls and subsequent injuries . Presurgical evaluation aims to establish the presence of drug resistance, delineate the epileptogenic zone to be resected and demonstrate that its removal will not cause additional unacceptable neurological or cognitive deficits . Sophisticated video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, which localizes the onset of a number of seizures that are typical for the particular patient . It comprises an implantable multiprogrammable pulse generator that delivers electrical current to the vagus nerve with the aim of reducing the frequency and/or severity of epileptic seizures . VNS is approved in the USA for use as adjunctive therapy for adults and adolescents over 12 years of age whose partial-onset seizures are refractory to AEDs . In Canada and the EU, VNS is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures in patients whose epileptic disorder is dominated by partial seizures (with or without secondary generalization) or generalized seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications . The implantation procedure lasts approximately 1 hour with the patient under general anesthesia to minimize any possible seizure interference during surgery . In addition, the patient or a companion may activate the generator by placing the magnet over it for several seconds; in some patients, this may interrupt a seizure or reduce its severity if applied soon after the seizure onset . A number of severely affected patients treated with VNS have had clinically important seizure reductions of over 50%, and a few have become seizure free . Patients may use the hand-held magnet to inhibit stimulation for side-effect management . Following the success of treatment for movement disorders, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is under active investigation as a non-pharmacological therapeutic modality for patients with medically intractable epilepsy who are not eligible for resective surgical procedures . Direct brain stimulation represents an exciting area of development but clearly further studies are needed to document its long-term efficacy and safety in order to define its place in the clinical management of epilepsy . The ketogenic diet is a restrictive high-fat, low-protein and very-low-carbohydrate diet mostly given to children aged 5-10 years with medically intractable epilepsy . The efficacy of the ketogenic diet has been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial, confirming results of previous retrospective and prospective observational studies that showed that a greater-than-50% seizure reduction was seen at 1 year on the diet in approximately 50% of children with intractable epilepsy . Clinicians should take a thorough history regarding herbal and dietary supplements, and consult reliable databases for information on safety as well as possible effects on seizure frequency and serum AED concentrations .","Patients should be referred for presurgical evaluation after failure of two or more regimens using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), particularly if they have a resectable lesion. Essential presurgical evaluation includes long-term video-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, MRI with a dedicated protocol, and neuropsychological assessment for language and memory functions. Most patients (70-80%) with mesial temporal sclerosis can become seizure free after anterior temporal lobectomy. Vagus nerve stimulation is a therapeutic option for patients with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures, particularly those with non-resectable seizure foci. The ketogenic diet is effective adjunctive therapy for children with drug-resistant epilepsy. The ketogenic diet should only be used under expert medical and nutritional supervision. Up to one-third of patients with epilepsy take herbal or dietary supplements for general maintenance of health or the control of symptoms such as difficulty sleeping or depression. Thus, knowledge of the products taken by the patient may provide the clinician with information on AED side effects or comorbid mood disorders. Clinicians must take a thorough history from patients regarding the use of alternative medicines, and check reliable databases for information on safety as well as possible effects on seizure frequency and serum AED concentrations."
9781910797907,chp6,"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequently used to support patients with PK deficiency, particularly during the first months of life . There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals . The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin . When patients have a transfusion, the goal nadir hemoglobin level should also be based on symptoms rather than on a level extrapolated from guidelines used in other anemias . Many patients with PK deficiency will never need a transfusion or will only require intermittent, or unplanned, transfusions during hemolytic crises due to infections or an aplastic crisis associated with parvovirus infection . During the first years of life, hemoglobin goals are those that allow for normal growth and development, and young children are often reliant on frequent transfusions to decrease symptoms and improve growth . As individuals age through adulthood, transfusion requirements may increase despite a stable hemoglobin, as a result of increased symptoms from the anemia, perhaps related to increased daily activity . Severely PK-deficient reticulocytes are metabolically more stable in the absence of the spleen; therefore, a paradoxical, sustained, robust reticulocytosis follows splenectomy in this disorder . After splenectomy, reticulocyte counts can be as high as 50-70% and, with the extended lifespan of PK-deficient reticulocytes in the absence of the spleen, hemoglobin levels increase by a median of 1.6 g/dL . In patients who received regular transfusions before splenectomy, approximately 80% can discontinue transfusions altogether following surgery . Approximately 14% of patients on regular transfusions prior to splenectomy will have a poor response and will continue to require regular transfusions . The burden of transfusions in PK deficiency varies between patients . The decision whether to have a splenectomy to improve the anemia of PK deficiency is complex and depends on both the physician's and the patient's perspective of the potential benefits and risks . Recent guidelines recommend splenectomy in patients who are reliant on regular transfusions or are severely anemic . Splenectomy should also be considered in patients who receive intermittent transfusions with every infectious illness or who have symptomatic anemia . Splenectomy in young children is associated with an increased risk of post-splenectomy sepsis, while a delay in splenectomy in patients who receive regular transfusions is associated with increased iron loading . With adequate vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics, the absolute risk of a serious infection is very low . If splenectomy is needed at an earlier age, the benefits must be balanced against the risk of infection . Most physicians recommend that asplenic children receive daily prophylaxis with penicillin VK until at least 5 years of age and for at least 1 year following splenectomy . Although the etiology for the increased risk is not clear, some physicians recommend taking low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after splenectomy, particularly in patients with marked thrombocytosis, to potentially decrease this risk . With the reticulocytosis associated with PK deficiency, folic acid needs are increased .","The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors. The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. Some patients with PK deficiency may tolerate a lower level of hemoglobin than those with other anemias due to increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Splenectomy is beneficial in increasing the hemoglobin level and decreasing the need for transfusions in most patients with PK deficiency. Given the potential risks associated with splenectomy, physicians should participate in shared decision making with their patients to determine whether to pursue splenectomy and at what age. The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis in PK deficiency is similar (approximately 10%) to other non-malignant hematologic conditions."
9781908541277,ch_5,"Depending on the pattern of neuronal involvement, the clinical features of a seizure consist of a wide range of sudden and transitory abnormal phenomena, which may include alterations of consciousness, or motor, sensory, autonomic or psychic events . Partial seizures can also be classified according to their clinical manifestations, such as focal motor, and can spread rapidly to other cortical areas through neuronal networks, resulting in secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (Figure 2.2) . Complex partial seizures, previously called temporal lobe or psychomotor seizures, are the most common seizure type in adults with epilepsy . Patients usually stare and either remain motionless or engage in repetitive semi-purposeful behavior called automatisms, including facial grimacing, gesturing, chewing, lip smacking, snapping fingers, repeating words or phrases, walking, running or even undressing . Generalized seizures are characterized by widespread involvement of bilateral cortical regions at the outset and are usually accompanied by impairment of consciousness . Other subtypes of generalized seizures include absence, myoclonic, clonic, tonic and atonic seizures (see Table 2.1) . Atypical absence seizures usually begin before 5 years of age in conjunction with other generalized seizure types and learning disability . In addition to the classification of seizures, there is a separate system for epilepsies and epileptic syndromes (Table 2.2) that has been in place for many years . These are defined by groups of characteristic clinical features related to age at onset of seizures, family history of epilepsy, seizure type(s) and associated neurological symptoms and signs, aided by appropriate investigations, including EEG and brain imaging with, for example, CT and MRI (see Chapter 3, Diagnosis) . Myoclonic seizures occur within the first few hours after arising from sleep (as do the generalized seizures), are mild and bilaterally symmetrical, and usually involve the upper extremities without impairing consciousness . Although febrile seizures are generally benign, around 5% of children with febrile convulsions later develop epilepsy, typically in adolescence or later . Factors associated with poor prognosis include seizures that have focal features or that last longer than 15 minutes, focal neurological abnormalities and a family history of afebrile seizures . Some children will go on to develop mesial temporal sclerosis and partial seizures that are often refractory to AED therapy . Most pediatric neurologists would not recommend long-term AED treatment for children with simple febrile seizures (id est generalized seizures lasting less than 15 minutes) . They are usually seen as part of West syndrome, which is defined as infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmic patterns on the EEG and severe encephalopathy with psychomotor retardation . Seizures typically occur daily, often in the tens or hundreds, and consist of axial tonic, tonic-clonic, atypical absence, myoclonic and atonic seizures, which often cause injuries . When the complex partial seizure ensues, impairment of consciousness is usually heralded by behavioral arrest and stare, followed by oro-alimentary, gestural and reactive automatisms lasting 1-2 minutes, which the patient does not remember . The identification of mutations for these disorders provided initial target genes to be examined in the more common idiopathic epilepsy syndromes .","A seizure is a symptom of brain dysfunction. Depending on the pattern of onset, seizures are broadly classified into partial (focal) and generalized types; classification is important for identifying the underlying cause, prognosis and best approach to management. Epileptic syndromes are defined by clinical features, aided by appropriate investigations that include EEG and brain imaging. Benign rolandic epilepsy occurs in otherwise neurologically normal children and generally has an excellent response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Long-term AED treatment for children with simple febrile seizures is not recommended. Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is often drug resistant but may be successfully treated by temporal lobectomy. Genetic mutations affecting ion channels have been identified in a range of rare idiopathic epilepsy syndromes."
9781910797006,ch08,"Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly those that result in hospitalization, place a large burden on healthcare resources . A commonly used definition characterizes exacerbations based on the type and number of symptoms, such as increases in dyspnea, sputum volume or sputum purulence with or without symptoms of upper respiratory infection (Table 8.1) . The severity of an exacerbation can also be defined in terms of increasing healthcare utilization as: mild (self-managed by the patient at home); moderate (requiring treatment by the primary care physician and/or hospital outpatient attendance); or severe (resulting in admission to hospital) . The hypercapnia of respiratory failure in some exacerbations is due to a number of factors including the increased work of breathing resulting from the increase in airways resistance and increase in systemic carbon dioxide production, and respiratory muscle fatigue . However, the presence of increased inflammation, and particularly the type of inflammation, is controversial and depends on whether the inflammatory response is assessed in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or bronchial biopsy, and on the severity of the exacerbation . Surrogate markers of oxidative stress are known to be elevated, compared with levels in healthy smokers, in the blood and exhaled breath of patients with stable COPD, and are further increased during exacerbations of COPD . Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are less common during exacerbations of COPD, but occur with increasing frequency in patients with severe airflow limitation . Studies in the 1960s, particularly in the UK, suggested that exacerbations of COPD were associated with small and transient decreases in respiratory function, and therefore did not alter the natural history of the disease . Patients with acute exacerbations typically present with increased cough, changes in sputum volume and/or purulence, and increased breathlessness, wheezing and chest tightness . The clinical history, examination and arterial blood gases are used to assess the severity of the exacerbation in order to judge whether a patient requires admission to hospital . The dose and the frequency of use of bronchodilators are increased in home management of exacerbations of COPD . The long-term use of nebulized therapy after acute exacerbations of COPD is not routinely recommended . Patients with purulent sputum and at least one of increased breathlessness or increased sputum production show greater improvement with antibiotics than with placebo during exacerbations of COPD . Provisional guidelines provide indications for hospital admission for acute exacerbations of COPD (Table 8.5) . Bronchodilator therapy can mitigate the effects of increased airway obstruction, namely increased respiratory work of breathing (hyperinflation, respiratory muscle mechanical disadvantage and impaired ventilation/perfusion matching), causing hypoxemia in patients with exacerbations of COPD . Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve lung function effectively in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD . The indications for initiating invasive mechanical ventilation during exacerbations of COPD are shown in Table 8.8 . Randomized controlled trials have shown that 20-30% of patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD can be safely allowed home with support without adverse consequences .","Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and place a huge burden on healthcare resources. The main etiologic factors in acute exacerbations are bacterial infection, respiratory viruses and air pollution. Treatment includes oxygen, increased use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and short-term oral glucocorticosteroids. Exacerbations can be prevented by inhaled corticosteroids and vaccination against influenza. Most exacerbations of COPD are managed at home, but those with suspected respiratory failure should be admitted to hospital. Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure."
9781910797105,ch06,"First, CT scans do not permit sufficient resolution of cortical and subcortical gray matter (id est nerve cells) and white matter (id est fiber tracts connecting different nerve cells) . Second, although ventricular enlargement and cortical sulcal widening suggest that people with schizophrenia may have relatively less brain tissue than normal controls, they are non-specific measures and cannot tell us where in the brain the tissue loss occurs, or whether the decrease in tissue is due to a developmental failure or to neurodegenerative processes . As these three compartments can each be measured, MRI enabled investigators to examine whether the brains of people with schizophrenia were characterized by specific morphological abnormalities . MRI studies demonstrated for the first time the involvement of cortical and subcortical gray matter structures . Specifically, people with schizophrenia were shown to exhibit decreased volume of the neocortex, by about 5%, with specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices . In addition to volume reductions in these areas, several studies have found that people with schizophrenia have a reversal or loss of the normal asymmetry of these structures . Finally, a series of studies has shown that the brains of people with schizophrenia are characterized by widespread abnormal thinning of the cerebral cortex, with marked changes in the frontal, temporal and cingulated cortical regions . In addition to locating the areas of the brain affected by schizophrenia, MRI studies have also been useful for examining . A series of longitudinal studies involving multiple MRI has evaluated whether schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with fixed morphological abnormalities, or a neurodegenerative disorder, with progressive changes in brain structure . These studies, conducted in childhood-onset, first-episode and chronic patient populations, have consistently demonstrated 2-10% decreases in cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes and 5-10% increases in ventricular volume . The possible progression of brain changes would be consistent with increased functional disability and cognitive decrements observed in a proportion of people with schizophrenia . Several studies have observed an association between decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) gray matter and hallucinations and delusions or positive formal thought disorder . The observation of multiple morphological abnormalities in cortical and subcortical gray matter raises the question of whether there is a disturbance in the white matter fiber tracts that connect these regions . There have been reports of decreased white matter volume, but such changes have not been observed consistently . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on the diffusion of water through different brain tissues and allows for the evaluation of white matter integrity . Several studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia with persistent negative symptoms have decreased fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts associated with social cognition . In combination with functional imaging, genetic and postmortem studies, DTI studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a dysconnection syndrome, characterized by abnormal connectivity among the different cortical and subcortical brain regions . The reduced cerebral cortical volume and thickness observed with MRI appears to result from a loss of the supportive glial cells, such as astrocytes, leading to an increased packing of neurons (Table 6.2) .","People with schizophrenia exhibit gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. People with schizophrenia have decreased volume of subcortical structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus and thalamus. A subgroup of patients may exhibit progressive changes in brain structure over the course of their illness. Men with schizophrenia have been found to have greater volume reductions in the temporal lobes than women. Hallucinations, delusions and positive formal thought disorder are associated with decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus. Diffusion tensor imaging studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal connections among cortical and subcortical structures."
9783318068207,hh-5,"The recent improvements in terms of available technologies and bioinformatics tools have allowed a better understanding of the pathobiology of different tumor types and the identification of several genomic alterations that may be targetable . The adoption of broad NGS gene panels (Table 3.1) may support the administration of immunotherapy drugs in patients harboring high TMB (see page 45) . Another potentially valuable approach is hybrid capture-based CGP, an ultra-sensitive assay that can be used to detect variants even in specimens with low tumor purity (a low proportion of tumor cells) . As far as variants are concerned and, in particular, when rare or unknown mutations are reported, it is fundamentally important to define the association with the risk of cancer development and progression . Single nucleotide variants in coding and intronic regions can significantly alter the functions of cancer-related genes . PCR-based techniques involve comparing the profiles of microsatellite loci generated by amplification from neoplastic samples and corresponding normal tissue material obtained from the same patient . In May 2017, the FDA approved the use of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in advanced stage solid tumors with MSI-H (evaluated by PCR or NGS) or dMMR (evaluated by IHC) status . TMB is the number of somatic, non-synonymous, coding base mutations that occur in a defined region of a tumor genome . The accumulation of a high number of mutations is able to generate several neoantigens that can potentially elicit a severe immune response against the tumor . have highlighted the responsiveness of patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high TMB to the anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab . However, as WES is currently unfeasible in routine clinical practice, with its high costs and long turnaround time, several different approaches are now employed, based on wide NGS panels . Patients were defined as having a high TMB when the tumor DNA harbored at least ten mutations per megabase . Different gene panels are available to evaluate TMB status (see Table 3.1) . Data interpretation potentially limits the usefulness of TMB analysis, regardless of the approach adopted (WES versus wide gene panels) and gene panel employed . underlined the positive predictive value for immunotherapy when mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and replication are identified, Skoulidis et al . RNA-based molecular approaches, such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), NGS and multiplex digital color-coded barcode technology, play a key role in identifying targetable gene fusions (Figure 3.3) . Another important field of application for RNA-based molecular approaches is the identification of splice variants . As for gene fusions, the presence of a splice variant may have a predictive role for therapy . This limitation can be overcome by NGS, which allows the identification of known and unknown gene alterations for different patients simultaneously . This is a multiplex digital color-coded barcode technology that can identify gene fusions and splice variants simultaneously . In addition, the nCounter technology is able to identify several gene fusions and splice variants, even when RNA is of low quality and target capture amplification fails .","Comprehensive genomic profiles offer a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor. The interpretation of the different variants reported, with attention focused on their clinical significance and usefulness for cancer patients, can support oncologists to make informed cancer treatment decisions. The clinical and pathological significance of several molecular variants, including SNVs, CNVs and indels, remains unknown. Some therapies are indicated for MSI-H cancer, and others are in clinical trials. Careful attention should be paid to the accuracy of the MMR evaluation (IHC, PCR or NGS). WES or wide gene panels may be employed to assess TMB status to guide immunotherapy decisions. RNA-based molecular approaches play a pivotal role in the identification of targetable gene fusions and splice variants."
9781910797105,ch04,"Usually, a series of individuals with schizophrenia, known as probands or index cases, is selected and rates of schizophrenia are assessed in their biological families . To express the results as rates, the number of affected relatives is divided by the total number and is age-corrected for relatives who are too young to have the disorder or are not yet through the age range at highest risk . Nevertheless, family studies have shown that if there is a genetic effect, it does not follow a recognized Mendelian pattern of autosomal dominance, like Huntington's disease, or recessiveness, like cystic fibrosis . However, the offspring of the unaffected MZ co-twins in discordant pairs are at increased risk of schizophrenia, suggesting that the co-twins still carry a genetic predisposition for the disease . Adoption studies offer the most robust evidence for genetic effects, as family environment is taken out of the equation . Follow-up studies trace the biological children of mothers with schizophrenia, who were adopted into healthy families at birth, and compare the number of offspring who develop schizophrenia with control adoptees of healthy non-schizophrenic mothers . Follow-back studies start with a group of adults with schizophrenia who were known to be adopted at birth . The results from family, twin and adoption studies subjected to modern diagnostic criteria support the notion that a proportion of biological relatives of probands with schizophrenia, while not having frank schizophrenia, have an unusual cluster of traits, such as schizotypal personality disorder or schizotypy . A number of other schizophrenia spectrum disorders are found in the families of probands with schizophrenia (Table 4.1) . Of the common variants, the evidence is strongest for the genes for zinc finger protein (ZNF804A; chromosome 2q32), neuregulin (NRG1; 8p12), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 6p22) and DISC1 (1q42) (Table 4.3) . To date, the definitive genome-wide association studies in 37 000 adults with schizophrenia and 113 000 controls have shown 108 different genetic associations, including dopamine and glutamate receptor genes and calcium channel genes . Most of the genes found by genome-wide association studies to be implicated in schizophrenia do seem plausible in that they are known to exert effects on neuronal systems and particularly synaptic function . Rates of CNVs have been shown to be higher in schizophrenia as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (Table 4.5) . Some CNVs for schizophrenia are associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders; for example, duplications at 15q13.3 are also the region for the commonest duplications in autism and Prader-Willi syndrome . As genes predisposing to schizophrenia are now being discovered, there is renewed interest in the association between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . The children of mothers with schizophrenia have a sixfold increased risk of bipolar disorder, as well as higher rates of schizophrenia . However, the neurodevelopmental risk factors that particularly appear to characterize schizophrenia, such as delayed milestones and obstetric complications, are not found in individuals who later develop bipolar disorder . Raised rates of CNVs are seen in schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder .","Having a close relative with schizophrenia increases one's own risk 15-fold. Identical twins show a 45% concordance rate. Individual vulnerability genes exist, which are each of small effect and interact with other genes and with environmental factors. A growing number of susceptibility genes have been identified, some of which also predispose to bipolar disorder. Copy number variants are rare major genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders."
9781910797006,ch03,"It is characteristic of patients with COPD to progress through the clinical stages of mild, moderate and severe disease . Considerable loss of lung function can occur before symptoms become apparent, and many patients may seek medical attention when the disease is at an advanced stage, since COPD is a slowly progressive disorder and patients gradually adapt their lives to their disability . Most smokers accept cough and shortness of breath, so they often dismiss these symptoms of progressive airflow limitation as a normal consequence of their smoking habit and the aging process . Breathlessness is the symptom that causes most disability and is associated with loss of lung function over time . The production of copious amounts of frothy sputum, particularly in association with orthopnea or hypertension and/or ischemic heart disease, raises the possibility of left ventricular failure and pulmonary edema . Patients with COPD often complain of chest tightness during exacerbations of breathlessness, particularly during exercise, and this is sometimes difficult to distinguish from ischemic cardiac pain . Psychiatric morbidity, particularly depression, is common in patients with severe COPD, which is likely to reflect the social isolation and the chronicity of the disease . As well as comorbidities commonly associated with COPD that should be addressed in their own right, the patient may have comorbidities such as heart disease that may further contribute to the restriction of activity (Table 3.3) . They depend on the degree of airflow limitation and pulmonary overinflation, and may be virtually absent in patients with mild-to-moderate disease, so their sensitivity in detecting or excluding COPD is poor . Patients with COPD often have a characteristic breathing pattern with a prolonged expiratory phase, although this is usually present only when disease is severe . Many smokers accept the development of exertional dyspnea and cough with sputum production as an inevitable consequence of the smoking habit, and therefore often present to their doctor when the disease is at a fairly advanced stage . However, COPD is also associated with a number of systemic effects and common comorbidities (see Table 3.3), which may be present at any stage of the disease . Cardiovascular disease is the most common and probably the most important comorbidity in patients with COPD . General population studies and studies in patients with COPD suggest that COPD is an important risk factor for ischemic heart disease and sudden cardiac death . The mechanism responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with COPD is unknown, but hypotheses include the effect of systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction . Anxiety and depression in patients with COPD are associated with younger age, female sex, greater airflow limitation, reduced health-related quality of life and a history of cardiovascular disease . COPD, in particular emphysema, also increases the risk of lung cancer, which is the commonest cause of death in patients with mild airflow limitation . The most recent classification from the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) takes into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation (Figure 3.2) .","COPD occurs, though less commonly, in those who do not smoke. Usually (in 80% of patients) there is a significant smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. For those with lesser smoking histories or for younger individuals, consider an alternative diagnosis or a genetic predisposition (exempli gratia alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency). The most common symptom in COPD is breathlessness on exertion. Dyspnea may be discounted by patients until disease is severe, as breathlessness can be avoided by restricting activity. Physical signs often present only at an advanced stage of the disease. Clinical indicators include signs of overinflation, prominent use of accessory muscles of respiration, weight loss, expiratory wheeze, cyanosis, peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure. These are usually apparent only in severe disease. The systemic effects of COPD result in a number of comorbidities that impact on the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The full spectrum of COPD can now be better identified using new classifications of disease that take into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation."
9781908541406,ch_13,"On the other hand, laboratory tests may be normal in patients with a clear history of previous bleeding; usually these patients have excessive surgical blood loss despite the normal tests . CTs with both epinephrine and ADP are delayed in some patients with von Willebrand disease or uremia, but only the epinephrine CT is prolonged with the use of ASA (aspirin) or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (see Chapter 4) . If these tests are normal, bleeding due to a platelet disorder is unlikely, but more sophisticated tests may be needed to exclude some congenital platelet function defects and milder forms of von Willebrand disease (see Chapter 7) . Patients with a history of bleeding after surgery or trauma may have hemophilia or liver disease, which can be diagnosed by measuring the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) (Table 11.2) . If the patient has a strong history suggestive of a bleeding disorder but normal screening tests, specific clotting factor levels should be measured or more detailed tests of platelet function performed . A prolonged aPTT with a normal PT is usually observed in patients receiving heparin, or when heparin contaminates a line being used for blood sampling . A mixing test (mixing equal volumes of the patient's plasma with normal plasma and determining the aPTT again) will exclude circulating anticoagulant . If the prolonged aPTT is due to a clotting factor deficiency, the aPTT should be corrected by the normal plasma to within 4 seconds of a simultaneously run control of normal plasma and buffer; otherwise a circulating anticoagulant should be suspected (see Chapter 13) . Patients with liver impairment have a complex coagulopathy, which includes low levels of clotting factors, defects in platelet function and abnormal fibrinolysis (see Chapter 9) . If a specific abnormality is not identified by the platelet count, bleeding time, PFA-100 analysis, aPTT or PT, patients with a history of bleeding should be referred to a coagulation consultant for further evaluation . Laboratory studies will demonstrate a low platelet count, prolonged aPTT and PT, and low fibrinogen levels . When the coagulation screen and full blood count are normal the most common causes of bleeding are local surgical factors (exempli gratia a small bleeding vessel) . Laboratory tests may reveal a prolonged aPTT but a normal PT, and deficiencies of FVIII, FIX or FXI may be documented (though the aPTT may be normal and measurement of the specific factor levels will be necessary to make the diagnosis) . Surgical trauma to vessels and tissues, as well as exposure of blood to artificial surfaces, induces activation of platelets, clotting factors and the fibrinolytic system . A recent study observed that bleeding occurred significantly more often in patients receiving bridging anticoagulation (3% versus 1%; p = 0.017), and was more likely if heparin was reinitiated within 24 hours of surgery . Occasionally, patients undergoing surgery for repair of major trauma will have massive bleeding, defined as the loss of 150% or more of blood volume .","A carefully taken history is the best screening test for a coagulation disorder. If a bleeding tendency is suspected, the platelet function analyzer-100 test, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and the prothrombin time (PT) may identify the cause. Thromboelastography may be useful in patients with massive bleeding. The management of surgical bleeding includes meticulous local hemostatic measures, as well as replacement of red cells, fibrinogen and platelets. Consider vitamin K therapy in every postoperative patient with a prolonged prothrombin time."
9781908541277,ch_12,"Not surprisingly then, mood states and psychiatric comorbidities substantially contribute to the quality of life of patients with epilepsy . The three most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are depression, anxiety and psychosis . Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up to 55% of patients in some studies - and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than seizure-specific variables such as seizure frequency and severity . Accordingly, symptoms of depression in patients with epilepsy often fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for affective disorders set out in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) . Diagnosis may be further complicated if the patient minimizes their psychiatric symptoms, or if the clinician does not inquire about psychiatric symptoms or considers depression to be part of the normal adaptation to the diagnosis of epilepsy . Clinicians often inadequately treat depression because they are concerned that antidepressant therapy will increase seizure frequency . The overall suicide rate in depressed patients with epilepsy is five times higher than that in the general population and as much as 25 times higher in patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin . Patients experience depression most often interictally as a chronic, waxing and waning disorder, usually in association with variable levels of irritability and emotionality . Some patients experience depression during a simple partial seizure (ictal depression) or during the postictal state . Few controlled trials of antidepressants have been conducted in patients with epilepsy and depression . Electroconvulsive therapy is not absolutely contraindicated in patients with epilepsy but should be reserved for medication-resistant depression . Anxiety is the second most common psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some studies . Serum concentrations of TCAs (which are metabolized by the 2D6 hepatic isoenzyme) are generally reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs such as CBZ, PHT, PB and PRM . Most antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol, perphenazine, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, thiothixene and risperidone, are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 and/or 3A4 hepatic isoenzymes and therefore their serum concentrations are lowered by hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs such as CBZ, PHT, PB and PRM, and increased by VPA . Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle . Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle . Employment is important for self-esteem, supporting an independent lifestyle, and affording health insurance and the costs of epilepsy treatment . Factors most often cited are lack of available transportation (particularly if seizures preclude driving), negative attitudes of employers and employees towards epilepsy, and lack of experience in the workplace . Patients with epilepsy may be unable to find affordable life insurance, particularly if applying for an individual policy . Patients who obtain life insurance through their place of employment generally do not have a problem .","Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life. The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures. Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures. When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients. Patients with epilepsy may have difficulty in finding affordable life insurance. Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures without unduly limiting activities."
9781910797815,chp3,"Risk stratification is essential to guide treatment decisions, given that patients with these conditions have a variable risk of vascular complications (thrombosis and hemorrhage) and progression to myelofibrosis, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or, to a lesser extent, myelodysplasia . The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for MPNs (Tables 3.2 - 3.4) are based on peripheral blood counts, molecular abnormalities and alterations in bone marrow morphology, reflecting the central role of erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis in the pathophysiology of these conditions . As shown in Figure 3.1, a patient with elevated platelet count (>= 450 x 10 /L) should undergo further blood testing, including a complete blood count, blood film/smear and determination of iron and C-reactive protein status, together with testing for MPN driver mutations and BCR-ABL1 . The presence of a driver mutation might suggest a diagnosis of ET but bone marrow biopsy is required to preclude other MPNs such as PV, PMF or myelodysplastic syndrome . Patients in whom PMF is suspected on the basis of clinical or laboratory findings should undergo genetic testing for driver mutations, followed by bone marrow biopsy to establish the diagnosis . The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PMF are shown in Table 3.4, and an algorithm for the differential diagnosis in Figure 3.3 . In addition to the risks of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to AML, the MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life . The extent to which an individual patient is at risk of vascular complications and disease progression is determined by multiple clinical and molecular risk factors (Table 3.5) . the International Prognostic Score for ET (IPSET)-thrombosis, which also includes the presence of JAK2 V617F and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use to estimate the risk of thrombosis . In addition to age and history of thrombosis, JAK2 mutation status has been shown to be an independent predictor of thrombosis-free survival in patients with ET (see Chapter 4) but this is not currently included in risk stratification algorithms . In addition to the risk factors included in these models, the clinical course of PV is also affected by the JAK2 V617F allele burden, which varies markedly between patients . In a prospective study of 338 patients, a JAK2 V617F allele burden of more than 50% was found to be an independent risk factor for progression to myelofibrosis . Three principal scoring systems are currently used for PMF (Table 3.8), all based on age, blood counts and the presence of constitutional symptoms . As with ET and PV, it is likely that future risk stratification models in myelofibrosis will incorporate genetic and molecular markers in addition to the risk factors currently included in the IPSS and DIPPS . Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has a more variable presentation, which may include all the features of PV and ET; however, anemia is a common finding and work-up requires the differential diagnosis of anemia . Furthermore, PMF is generally associated with the most severe symptom burden among the MPNs, although patients with PV or ET often also have significant disease-related symptoms (see Table 3.1) .","The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are based on abnormalities of peripheral blood counts and alterations in bone marrow morphology. The diagnostic approach to essential thrombocythemia (ET) generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. In contrast to ET, polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include symptomatic splenomegaly, anemia, constitutional symptoms (exempli gratia fatigue, pruritus), thrombosis and bleeding. In addition to the risk of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life. An individual patient's risk of vascular complications and disease progression depends on multiple clinical and molecular risk factors. Since the level of risk will influence treatment decisions, effective risk stratification is essential for effective management of MPNs. Risk stratification models have been developed for all three MPNs."
9781910797310,chp3,"Surgical resection has proved valuable in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC without nodal involvement or distant metastasis, resulting in long-term survival with a lower risk of postoperative mortality . In the present staging system, T4N0-1M0 lesions are categorized as stage IIIA disease (see Table 3.4), and T4 tumors without mediastinal nodal metastasis are now considered to be potentially curable if complete resection is possible . Further clinical trials are needed to clarify the timing of surgery as part of multimodal treatment for resectable stage IIIA NSCLC . At present, the extent of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) disease is staged according to the 2009 tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification (seventh edition) . The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has proposed several changes to be implemented in the forthcoming eighth edition, which reflect global experience in the management of NSCLC . Subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare the survival benefit of sublobar resections (id est wedge resection or segmentectomy) and lobectomy (see pages 24 -) . A fundamental prerequisite in selecting patients for surgical treatment is reliable nodal staging (Table 3.2) . Surgery is the gold standard treatment for early-stage (I and II) lung cancer (Table 3.4) . Surgical procedures continue to evolve along a 'less is more' trajectory, with an increasing trend toward minimally invasive techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS] or robotics) and the removal of as little lung parenchyma as possible (lobectomy > segmentectomy > wedge resection; Figure 3.1) . Minimally invasive procedures for early-stage NSCLC have become standard and an alternative to open surgery in centers with the appropriate experience . A review of 45 prospective and retrospective studies conducted over the last 25 years showed that segmentectomies are superior to wedge resections in terms of local recurrences and cancer-related mortality rates . Lobectomies had better results than segmentectomies for tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter (T2bN0M0) in terms of disease-free and overall 5-year survival . In general, recent studies have failed to show any difference in survival outcomes between lobectomies, segmentectomies and wedge resections for small tumors less than 2 cm, although patients with invasive adenocarcinoma less than 2 cm may have improved survival outcomes after segmentectomy . The results of randomized clinical trials are awaited to determine if segmentectomies may be the preferred surgical treatment for the new classifications of T1a and T1b N0M0 tumors . These tumors are associated with good survival after resection and have a lower propensity for nodal and extrathoracic spread than other types of NSCLC; however, they frequently relapse . The main difficulty is localizing the tumor within the lung during minimally invasive surgery . In cases of bilateral pneumonic-type involvement with deep hypoxemia, lung transplantation has been studied in specifically selected patients with a high-risk of recurrence, with limited results . For diffuse pneumonic-type lung cancer, T staging is designated by the tumor size if it is within one lobe, or as T4 if it involves an ipsilateral different lobe, or M1a if it is contralateral .","Better subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare wedge resection and segmentectomy. New M1c staging for multiple metastases in one or several organs and the use of the term M1b for oligometastatic disease has the potential to provide rational selection criteria for clinical treatment trials. Ground glass opacity (GGO) visualized on high-resolution computed tomography should trigger careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy. Some locally advanced lung cancers benefit from multimodality therapy, which can include surgery."
9781910797426,ch12,"A variety of tumors arise in close proximity to or within the pancreas that require special consideration and need to be differentiated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Table 12.1) . Cancers of the ampulla of Vater, the intrapancreatic bile duct and duodenum are all adenocarcinomas and often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer . All of these tumors progress from a small benign adenoma through to invasive adenocarcinoma, although most are only detected at the cancerous stage . Ampullary tumors arise from the common channel of the ampulla of Vater as benign adenomas and progress as tubulovillous adenomas before becoming adenocarcinomas . The long-term survival of patients with these cancers is better than that for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Figure 12.1) . Ampullary tumors are relatively common (around 1 per 100 000 in the general population), whereas bile duct cancer is much less common and duodenal cancer is rare . The incidence of duodenal tumors is increased in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and also Peutz-Jeghers syndrome . These tumors often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer, with obstructive jaundice and weight loss . Patients with an ampullary tumor may also present with intermittent jaundice or acute pancreatitis . The 5-year survival rates for completely resected tumors are about 50%, 30% and 25% for cancers of the ampulla, bile duct and duodenum, respectively . Ampullary tumors tend to be slow growing, so endoscopic stenting can provide good medium-to-long-term palliation in advanced patients . Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) arise from cells in the islet of Langerhans or enterochromaffin-like cells . The tumors may be functioning (Table 12.2), with the ability to secrete peptides and neuroamines (some of which cause specific clinical syndromes), or they may be non-functioning . Several autosomal dominant diseases are associated with pNETs, including multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type-1, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, von Recklinghausen disease (neurofibromatosis 1) and, rarely, tuberous sclerosis . Patients with a suspected pNET require a full hormone screen, which should include chromogranin A and B levels, which are frequently elevated in non-functioning NETs . Gastrinoma causes very high gastric acid secretion, resulting in refractory multiple peptic ulcers, often of a severe nature (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and sometimes diarrhea . Somatostatinoma and pancreatic polypeptide tumor do not cause distinct clinical syndromes and should be distinguished from non-functioning NETs . The syndromes associated with all of these tumors, except for insulinoma, can be managed medically during the wait for surgery or, if there is metastatic disease, with a long-acting somatostatin receptor antagonist (octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide slow release) . In general, pNETs have a good prognosis, provided complete resection of the primary tumor, lymph node and even hepatic metastases is undertaken . Radical resection is required for pNETs other than insulinomas as they tend to be malignant . Malignancy in insulinoma is indicated by the presence of lymph-node metastases, and a formal pancreatic resection is therefore also required . Endolymphatic sac tumors and multiple pancreatic cysts, both of which are rare in the general population, suggest carrier status .","Tumor types that occur in the ampullary and periampullary regions may have a much better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Neuroendocrine tumors should usually be removed surgically. Patients with inherited neuroendocrine tumors require genetic counseling and long-term follow-up for pancreatic and other tumor types. Cystic pancreatic tumors need to be differentiated from pancreatic pseudocysts, but only a minority need resection at the time of diagnosis. Solitary metastases to the pancreas may be worth resecting."
9781908541024,ch_9,"Germ cell tumors, the most common type of tumor in the pineal region, comprise a heterogeneous group of primary brain tumors arising from pluripotential germinal cells . Other germ cell tumors include teratomas, and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors such as choriocarcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor and embryonal carcinoma . More than 70% of germ cell tumors present before the patient reaches the age of 21 years, typically in those aged 10-13 years . Males are 2-4 times more likely than females to develop a germ cell tumor, but there is a predilection for suprasellar tumors to occur in females . An increased incidence of germ cell tumors has been reported in both Klinefelter and Down syndromes . Non-germinomatous germ cell tumors are highly malignant and commonly exhibit mixed histological features . Immature teratomas are much more common than mature teratomas, and may have elements of carcinoma, sarcoma or other non-germinomatous germ cell tumors . Patients with pineal region tumors present with features of obstructive hydrocephalus, resulting from occlusion of the aqueduct of Sylvius . In addition to tumors in the pineal region, a subset of germ cell tumors arise in a suprasellar location . This is particularly important when a non-germinomatous germ cell tumor is suspected, as these tumors often have mixed histology . The only circumstance in which histopathology is not mandatory for diagnosis is when a patient has elevated CSF markers that indicate the presence of a malignant germ cell tumor . Although serum and CSF markers can be helpful when positive, negative markers do not exclude an aggressive histology, as non-germinomatous germ cell tumors can be marker-negative . Teratomas and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors are notably heterogeneous on MRI, both pre- and post-contrast, and are more likely than pure germinomas to show evidence of infiltration into surrounding normal brain . CSF studies and spinal MRI should also be obtained in all patients with a germ cell tumor . Treatment differs for pure germinomas, teratomas and non-germinomatous germ cell tumors, as described below . Second-look surgery may be important in patients with apparent residual tumor following treatment, as this may represent an element of mature teratoma or necrosis that can be cured with resection . Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for patients with pure germinoma . All germ cell tumors are chemosensitive and successful regimens, usually platinum-based, have been reported for relapse, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment . Ideally, patients with non-germinomatous germ cell tumors should be treated within a clinical trial; otherwise, they should receive 2-6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy . Therefore, it is recommended that all patients with suprasellar germ cell tumors be evaluated and followed by an endocrinologist . Pineocytomas typically occur in adults and can be cured with surgical resection; radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery should be used in patients with an incomplete resection . The wide range of tumor types that can arise in the pineal region makes histological diagnosis mandatory . The only exception is a patient with elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers that indicate the presence of a malignant germ cell tumor .",Tumors of the pineal region often present with obstructive hydrocephalus. The wide range of tumor types that can arise in the pineal region makes histological diagnosis mandatory.

9781910797617,chp6,"The expanded genetic characterization of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis is a critical advance in the last 5 years and is influencing both treatment and patient selection for standard therapy and clinical trials in AML . Many of these products in development have been awarded breakthrough status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recognizing the lack of effective treatments for patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and those with relapsed or refractory disease, for whom the prognosis is poor . A non-randomized Phase II study reported a remission rate of 44% and median overall survival (OS) of 23 weeks in patients with FLT3 -ITD-mutated AML that had relapsed or was refractory to second-line treatment or relapsed following HCT in a non-randomized Phase II study . Gilteritinib is also being evaluated across multiple lines of treatment in patients with FLT3-positive AML, including for maintenance treatment following chemotherapy or HCT, first-line treatment, and in comparison with salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease . Pracinostat is an oral histone deacetylase inhibitor that is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in older patients (>= 75 years) who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy (because of age or comorbidities) . Activity was limited as monotherapy in AML but much better response rates were seen in combination with hypomethylating agents (decitabine or azactidine) in older patients (>= 65 years) who were not eligible for induction chemotherapy: 70-75% of patients achieved CR or CRi . Venetoclax is also being evaluated in combination with low-dose cytarabine in a non-randomized open-label Phase I/II study in elderly patients (>= 65 years) with treatment-naÃ¯ve AML who not eligible for intensive chemotherapy . A Phase II study of GMI-1271 in combination with cytarabine plus mitoxantrone and etoposide in patients (aged > 60 years) reported a CR/CRi rate of 75% in those with treatment-naÃ¯ve AML and 67% in those with secondary AML . The FDA has recently approved two novel immunologic therapies for malignancies of B-lymphocytes: chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell products that target CD19 (by Novartis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia; by KITE for non-Hodgkin lymphoma) . New approaches to treatment include antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and novel antibody-based approaches using bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) and dual-affinity re-targeting (DART) molecules, which bind to CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts, thereby directing activated immune cells to malignant cells . Studies with cellular therapies and other antibody-based therapies are of great interest and promise in AML, including with CAR-T or NK cells, and likewise with antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 or other markers of interest . Included among these are new ADCs and novel antibody-based approaches using BiTEs or DARTs designed to direct activated immune cells to malignant cells (id est dual affinity for CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts) . The aim is to quickly and comprehensively genetically characterize older patients (> 60 years) with previously untreated AML and to treat with novel targeted therapy on the basis of the genetic result .","A wide range of targeted agencies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently in the late stages of development, including FLT3 inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, giltertinib, sorafenib), hypomethylating agents (guadecitabine, oral azacitidine), the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat, the blc-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the E-selectin inhibitor GM-1271. Immunologic therapies, antibody-drug conjugates and antibody-based approaches are also being explored in AML. The approval of enasidenib based on single-arm Phase I/II data is challenging the dogma that large randomized controlled trials in a general AML population are required. Trials of new targeted agents are likely to be in small, clearly defined patients with subtypes of AML. The Beat AML trial is using early and comprehensive genetic characterization to assign patients to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations, each receiving a tailored treatment. This approach will hopefully speed up the development of promising agents. Key to all approaches to the treatment of AML is the need to achieve disease control, and continued consideration of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation when feasible."

The pathophysiology of acne centers on the interplay of four main factors (Figure 2.1) . the action of Propionibacterium acnes within the follicle and dermis . Increased sebum production . Increased sebum production . Acne is a hormonally mediated disease, with androgens contributing to an increase in sebum production from sebaceous glands . Increased sebum production, which presents as seborrhea, correlates well with acne severity . Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is thought to be the main androgen responsible for sebum production, although a possible direct role of testosterone has not been excluded . Follicular hyperkeratinization involves increased keratinocyte proliferation and decreased desquamation of the cells lining the orifice of sebaceous follicles of the face, scalp, chest or back, resulting in sebum- and keratin-filled microcomedones . As hyperkeratinization progresses, a microcomedone develops into either an open comedone (blackhead) or a closed comedone (whitehead) . It takes approximately 8 weeks for a microcomedone to develop into a visible acne lesion . This process of follicular hyperkeratinization and possibly an increase in cell division and cohesiveness of the cells lining the follicular lumen, producing comedones, has been referred to as 'follicular plugging', although complete occlusion of the follicular lumen does not occur; sebum still flows from follicles affected with acne . The cause of follicular hyperkeratinization is not known but may relate to a local deficiency of linoleic acid or production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 within the follicle . Once sebum production begins at adrenarche, sebaceous follicles become colonized with the commensal bacterium P . This bacterium utilizes sebaceous lipids as a nutrient source and hydrolyzes the triglycerides found in sebum into free fatty acids and glycerol . The free fatty acids are an irritant to the follicular wall and can lead to rupture of the follicle, with subsequent release of keratin-rich corneocytes and sebum into the dermis . acnes is also a potent activator of the innate immune response in acne via its activation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and the inflammasome (a multiprotein cytoplasmic complex), each of which leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines within affected skin . Inflammatory lesions are thought to develop from comedones following the influx of inflammatory cells and/or rupture of the follicular wall . Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of inflammatory responses even in the very earliest phases of acne lesion development . Papules and pustules may evolve into tender inflammatory nodules or 'cysts' as the extent of the inflammation increases . Inflammatory acne may produce scarring . Stress may worsen acne; in turn, acne certainly and frequently causes more stress . Factors that have been implicated include 'glycemic load', the intake of dairy products, skim milk, chocolate and whey, obesity, reduced intake of fish, lack of omega-3 fatty acids and others . Epidemiological studies suggest a possible link with intake of skim milk, while clinical trials in very small numbers of patients suggest that a diet with a low glycemic index may be beneficial in patients with acne, as summarized in recent systematic reviews on this topic .","Acne is a hormonally mediated disease. Four main factors are implicated in the etiology of acne:- high sebum production- hyperkeratinization of the intrafollicular duct- colonization by Propionibacterium acnes- inflammation. There are many myths about the factors that influence acne; patients should be made aware of the appropriate facts (see Table 8.1, pages 83-4 )."
9781910797471,ch05,"Assessment of functional class (see Table 2.1), based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic HF because it is linked to outcome - the annualized mortality in NYHA class IV HF is about 50%, which is four to five times that of class II and twice that of class III . However, these features are ill-suited to the recognition of HF with preserved ejection fraction, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has proposed the incorporation of imaging findings in order to facilitate the recognition of HF in patients presenting with exercise intolerance alone (see Table 5.4) . The initial clinical picture of acute HF reflects the varying degree of impairment of cardiac output and elevation in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (obtained at left and right heart catheterization, respectively) . Patients with acute HF can present with one of several distinct hemodynamic profiles, based on the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold) (Figure 5.3) . More specific for acute HF is Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention . Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement . Atrial arrhythmias contribute to reduced functional capacity, as atrial systole makes an important contribution to stroke volume, especially in the context of LV filling problems and particularly with exercise . In most patients, routine biochemistry includes blood tests for electrolytes and renal and liver function, a full blood count (to assess anemia) and evaluation of C-reactive protein levels if infection is suspected . Thyroid function tests and iron studies should be obtained at initial presentation in patients with cardiomyopathies . Type B natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels need only be assessed in the acute setting when echocardiography is not available and the diagnosis is in doubt . In such circumstances, levels of BNP lower than 100 pg/mL and NT-proBNP lower than 300 pg/mL would make the diagnosis of HF in patients with acute dyspnea highly unlikely (beware of patients with flash pulmonary edema or right ventricular [RV] dysfunction where the levels may be low) . Electrocardiography will help to identify atrial fibrillation, evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or LV hypertrophy (LVH) and conduction delay or abnormalities (exempli gratia QT c interval) . The main goals of echocardiography are to assess LV size, systolic and diastolic LV function, disturbances of regional function (which suggest an ischemic heart disease etiology), valve regurgitation and LVH . The assessment of myocardial deformation with strain has helped in early detection of myocardial dysfunction (cardiotoxicity) and disease-specific patterns of myocardial involvement (exempli gratia apical sparing in cardiac amyloidosis) . The last is used to detect and quantify transmural scarring in CAD (see assessment of viability, below) and to identify scarring in non-coronary heart disease . Functional testing is of value for objective quantification of exercise capacity at any stage, but especially in patients who are being evaluated for advanced therapies, including devices and transplantation .","Assessment of functional class, based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic heart failure (HF) as it is linked to outcome. Also key to the diagnosis of HF is the assessment of ejection fraction, underlying etiology and precipitating factors, and the role of coronary artery disease. The hemodynamic profile of acute HF varies according to the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold). Atrial arrhythmias contribute to a reduction in functional capacity, while ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF. Investigations in patients with HF include blood tests, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and other imaging techniques. Functional testing is of particular value in patients deemed suitable candidates for devices or transplantation."
9781910797105,ch08,"The major neurochemical pathophysiological hypotheses continue to involve the traditional neurotransmitters, although this situation is changing as novel molecular biological techniques are applied to the study of schizophrenia . In the early 1960s, the Swedish pharmacologist Arvid Carlsson (Figure 8.2) posited the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, in which he stated that schizophrenia was caused by an excess of dopaminergic activity, either an excess of dopamine release and/or hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors . First was the recognition of a schizophrenia-like psychosis in people who misused amphetamine, a drug known to increase the release of dopamine . In the following 15 years, while several experiments provided compelling, but circumstantial, evidence in further support of the importance of the dopamine D receptor in schizophrenia, there remained known shortcomings in the dopamine hypothesis and a lack of direct evidence . In addition, the prediction that untreated patients should have increased numbers of dopamine receptors received no firm support from postmortem assays nor, more critically, from studies using positron emission tomography (PET), which imaged the binding of radiolabeled antipsychotic drugs to receptors . Second, in the late 1980s, new biomolecular techniques found five dopamine receptor subtypes, which differ functionally and in their pattern of target neuron/brain region distribution (Table 8.1) . Studies using this approach have shown increased dopamine release following a bolus of a dopamine-releasing agent such as methylphenidate in drug-free patients with schizophrenia compared with controls, providing the first direct evidence for the dopamine hypothesis (Figure 8.3) . The extent of dopamine release correlates with the severity of positive psychotic symptoms and also predicts how well a patient will respond to antipsychotic drug treatment . Another approach has examined the effects of antipsychotic drugs on dopamine D receptor occupancy . Studies have shown a strong association between dopamine D receptor occupancy, antipsychotic dose, symptom remission and adverse effects . Finally, multiple studies have demonstrated that dopamine plays a central role in reward mechanisms, especially the mesolimbic projection to the nucleus accumbens . People with schizophrenia exhibit several impairments that are consistent with altered reward system function, including anhedonia, decreased motivation and failure to use feedback to enhance goal-directed behavior . It acts at ionotropic receptors, which mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and at metabotropic receptors, which activate second messenger systems through the G-protein system and regulate the release of glutamate and other neurotransmitters (Table 8.2) . Abnormalities in NMDA receptor function have been hypothesized to disrupt glutamatergic system function in people with schizophrenia . Some, but not all, of these studies have shown that glycine and D-cycloserine, which bind to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, may be effective treatments for negative symptoms . Glycine transporter type 1 inhibitors, such as bitopertin, prevent reuptake of synaptic glycine and so enhance NMDA receptor function, but have not been shown to be effective for negative symptoms or cognitive impairments . These TRS studies build on other evidence for a glutamate hypothesis . Acetylcholine modulates the release of a number of different neurotransmitters, including dopamine and glutamate .",The dopamine hypothesis remains the major neurochemical hypothesis of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms are hypothesized to be due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Negative symptoms are hypothesized to be due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway. Altered glutamate activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of negative and positive symptoms and cognitive impairments. Disturbances in the cholinergic and GABAergic systems have been hypothesized to underlie cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.
9781912776207,ch4,"Skin rash may be present, particularly in patients with PTCL-NOS or AITL . Because 30% of PTCL-NOS cases show bone marrow involvement, a biopsy is recommended as part of initial staging in all patients . PET-CT is particularly useful for imaging extranodal PTCL and types of T-cell lymphoma presenting in the skin, and is recommended at staging and restaging; however, residual FDG-avid lesions lack specificity, and biopsy confirmation is recommended . Table 4.3 presents an overview of pathological diagnosis based on the MD Anderson Cancer Center practice algorithm and elaborated with the authors' clinical experience . The immunophenotypes of PTCL, TCR rearrangement and putative cell of origin are shown in Table 2.2 (page 19) . The presence of at least three of the following markers indicates follicular T-helper cell origin: CD10, BCL-6, CXCL13, PD1, SAP, ICOS and CCR5; however, morphology should also be evaluated before diagnosing AITL . CD30 is variably positive in selected patients with other types of T-cell lymphoma, including EATL, AITL and PTCL-NOS . CD20 and PAX5 allow the identification of B-cell components and can help in distinguishing ALK âˆ’ ALCL from morphologically aggressive classic Hodgkin lymphoma (PAX5 +) with anaplastic features . Cytotoxic markers (TIA-1, granzyme B and perforin) are expressed in NK and gammaÎ´ T-cell lymphomas and may indicate more aggressive clinical behavior . EBV may be detected in a subset of patients with PTCL-NOS, AITL and in all cases of ENKTCL . TCR clonality is negative in 20% of AITL cases, likely to be because of low tumor burden and contamination by non-malignant stromal cells . ALK + ALCL with small cell morphology (5-10% of cases) can be confused with CD30 + PTCL-NOS if ALK staining is not performed . Up to 30% of AITL cases may demonstrate clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements but this does not fulfil the criteria for a composite B-cell lymphoma . For example, the International T-cell Lymphoma study reported overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival of 10% at 10-15 years in patients with PTCL-NOS . Several prognostic indices have been developed, informed by studies which identified risk factors that predicted OS and progression-free survival (Table 4.6) . The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was developed in 1993 to identify factors that predict the prognosis of patients with aggressive NHL, as Ann Arbor stage alone did not adequately predict survival outcomes . The IPI has been shown to predict survival in patients with ALCL, AITL and PTCL-NOS, but not for other PTCL entities, and is the most commonly used prognostic index for T-cell lymphoma . The Prognostic Index for T-cell Lymphomas (PIT) was developed in an attempt to produce more accurate prognostic indicators for PTCL subtypes . Retrospective univariate analysis of data from 385 PTCL-NOS cases identified factors associated with worse OS as . Multivariate analysis identified four independent risk factors - age, serum LDH, OS and bone marrow involvement . The modified Prognostic Index for T-cell Lymphoma (mPIT) replaced bone marrow involvement with expression of the proliferation-associated protein Ki-67 .","Many patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas present with systemic symptoms, and extranodal involvement is common. Detailed immunophenotypic analysis is necessary to accurately diagnose PTCL subtypes. PET scanning can be helpful to diagnose extranodal disease. The International Prognostic Index and the PTCL-specific index are useful prognostic tools. Epstein-Barr virus and CD30 are expressed in several subtypes of PTCL."
9781910797495,chp9,"Also, patients with cancer may have pre-existing chronic pain that continues, in addition to cancer pain (Table 9.1) . Some patients with aggressive tumors may have escalating (or 'crescendo') pain requiring optimum pain management options, and the needs of cancer 'survivors' - who live for many years with chronic pain and who are increasing in numbers - also need to be addressed . The choice of treatment options is based on similar considerations to those for patients with chronic non-cancer pain . However, variability in presentation of pain and its treatment (see Tables 9.1 and 9.2) make it essential to carefully evaluate each patient regardless of the cancer type . It is likely that the risk of persistent pain is higher in patients who also receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, in addition to surgery . The large majority of episodes of acute cancer-related pain are due to tumor invasion of pain-sensitive structures, which causes pathophysiological processes of the 'injury response', including inflammation, edema, acidosis and necrosis . Many such pains improve with treatment of the cancer, but some will proceed to a chronic version of the acute presentation (Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . Chronic pain may be caused directly by the cancer (about 78%), treatment of the cancer (19%), or conditions unrelated to the cancer (exempli gratia concurrent diseases) and/or factors in the psychosocial domains (3%) (see Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . (1991) found that, in 18% of patients presenting with pain as a problem, a thorough history and examination revealed new evidence of metastatic disease requiring anti-tumor treatment . Yet chronic cancer pain is a nociceptive mosaic; pain may be due to tumor infiltration of nerves (neuropathic pain) or other tissues (somatic or visceral pain), or may be related to the treatment or procedure that the patient receives . Given the spectrum of potential pain sources and mechanisms, it is clear that several elements may be active in a single patient with cancer pain and that treatment should address all the pain mechanisms at play (Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . As with all chronic pain, psychosocial factors are of profound importance in patients with cancer pain (see Table 9.5) . However, in this scenario, it is crucial to establish whether the pain is related to the cancer itself, the associated treatments or other conditions (see Tables 9.2 - 9.5) . Thus, patients should be asked about the onset of pain - whether it was present before the cancer or associated with the initiation of treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy - and whether it has progressed . Many of the preceding chapters describe pain conditions and treatments that are applicable to both non-cancer pain and cancer pain, with treatments in the areas of pharmacology, physical therapy, psychological strategies, interventional treatments and other options . In addition, if feasible, treatment of the cancer itself, with chemotherapy, surgery, external radiotherapy and/or radionuclide therapy is potentially a primary option for reducing pain . Conversely, each of these treatment options can be the cause of further pain - usually neuropathic (see Table 9.3) .","Cancer pain is a nociceptive mosaic in which pain may arise from inflammation, tumor infiltration of nerves (neuropathic pain) or other tissues (visceral or somatic pain), treatment, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and from other psychological and environmental factors. Treatment of the cancer itself (by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery etc.) is a primary option in cancer pain management; however, such treatment may be the cause of pain (especially neuropathic pain). Opioids are the foundation for management of cancer pain of moderate to severe intensity, but other drugs should also be considered depending on the pain conditions and mechanisms involved (exempli gratia neuropathic, myofascial, arthritic); however, treatment of cancer pain should not rely on drugs alone, since there are many other options that will produce good results. Psychological therapies that promote 'self-help' strategies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and meditation/relaxation, as well as integrative treatments such as massage and acupuncture, are often useful as part of a multimodal treatment approach to support patients with cancer pain and related symptoms. Radiotherapy is effective for pain from bone metastases. Neural blockade can be used for isolated pain-causing lesions."
9781912776726,ch2,"Most patients with glioblastoma present with a clinical history of 3-6 months, although a small proportion have rapid onset of symptoms, clinically similar to a stroke . The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of surrounding brain tissue and secondarily from the effects of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the tumor and edema . There is no fixed pattern of symptom progression; specific signs and symptoms will vary from person to person depending on the area of the brain that is affected (see Typical locations, Table 1.1) . Patients commonly experience focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, sensory loss or visual field defects, reflecting the location of the tumor . Patients with frontal tumors often present with cognitive deficits, a change in personality or a mood disorder and are often mistakenly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder . Five percent of patients present with aphasia due to a tumor in the speech-dominant hemisphere, which may be mistaken for confusion or delirium . Around 20-40% of patients present with seizures, which are most commonly associated with tumors of the temporal lobe . Raised intracranial pressure can occur as a result of increasing tumor size and surrounding edema . Patients may also present with other symptoms of raised ICP, such as nausea, vomiting and papilledema . A systematic review identified symptom prevalence in patients at different stages of their glioma treatment . The most common symptoms are shown in Table 2.1; other symptoms included alopecia, anorexia, anxiety/depression, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, gait disturbance, nausea/vomiting, pain, right-left confusion, sensory deficits, skin problems, urinary incontinence and visual defects . Eight of the ten most prevalent symptoms shown in Table 2.1 (excluding confusion and dysphagia) are included in at least two of the three assessment tools for patient-reported outcome measures: the brain cancer-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BN20), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) module . These instruments are mostly used in clinical trials or research studies as a means of monitoring disease trajectory and the effect of treatments on quality of life and symptoms (Figure 2.1) . They are important, as good symptom management has been shown to improve survival in other diseases such as lung cancer; however, symptoms are predominantly caused by the tumor, and to a lesser degree by the treatment . Confusion (40.3%), dysphagia (41.9%) and dyspnea (17.7%) are more prevalent at the end of life than during diagnosis, treatment and follow-up . A higher prevalence of confusion is seen at the end of life in patients with primary brain tumors than in patients with brain metastases or a general palliative care population . Aside from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life in cancer, such as anorexia and weight loss, tend to occur less often in patients with glioma than in other patients receiving palliative care . Thus, patients require tailored symptom care at different times during the course of their disease .","The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of the surrounding brain tissue and from the effects of increased intracranial pressure due to increasing tumor size and surrounding edema. The most prevalent symptoms of glioblastoma are neurological in nature. Apart from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life (exempli gratia anorexia, weight loss) in patients receiving palliative care for other forms of cancer are less common in patients with glioblastoma. Seizures and cognitive deficits tend to be seen throughout the trajectory of the disease. Headache and dizziness are more common in the early diagnostic phase, and nausea/vomiting, visual deficits and anorexia are more prevalent during treatment. Confusion, dysphagia, dyspnea, aphasia, drowsiness and fatigue are more prevalent at the end of life. The trajectory of the disease varies widely from patient to patient depending on the location of the tumor and other patient- and treatment-related factors. Patients with glioblastoma should be treated on an individual basis according to their symptom burden at different phases of the disease course."
9781910797815,chp2,"Population-based epidemiology data are heterogeneous, possibly reflecting the changing classification of the disorders over time, misdiagnoses and problems with case ascertainment . However, recent meta-analyses and population-based registry studies have provided useful insights into the epidemiology of the MPNs . The incidence and prevalence of these MPNs has been investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 studies conducted worldwide . The crude annual incidence for the MPNs combined was 2.58 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval 1.90-3.50), with individual studies yielding rates of 1.15-4.99 per 100 000 (Table 2.1) . In general, incidence was similar in men and women in the systematic review, although the incidence of ET was numerically higher in women (Table 2.1) . By contrast, real-world data from the UK population-based Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) show that age-standardized incidence is similar for ET, PV and MPN, unclassifiable, whereas myelofibrosis is approximately twice as common in men as in women . Most of the available epidemiology data are from Europe and North America; the incidence of the MPNs is similar in these two regions, as shown in Table 2.2 . The pooled annual incidence in children aged <=16 years was 0.003 per 100 000 for PMF and 0.004-0.11 per 100 000 for ET; no data on pediatric PV were reported . Studies from Europe and North America have reported prevalence rates of 11.0-42.5 per 100 000 for ET, 0.49-46.88 per 100 000 for PV, and 1.76-4.05 per 100 000 for PMF . One North American study reported an overall prevalence for all chronic MPNs in the general population of 93.3 per 100 000 . Prevalence in the UK reported by the HMRN is shown in Table 2.3 . In general, the prevalence of each condition is similar in men and women . In general, patients with ET or PV have a near-normal life expectancy with current treatment strategies, whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival . The UK HMRN has reported 3-year relative survival rates of more than 90% in patients with the chronic MPNs (ET, PV, MPN, unclassifiable) compared with fewer than 70% in those with myelofibrosis (Figure 2.1) . However, the emergence of new and improved treatments in recent years has markedly improved survival rates . In addition to the presence of the driver mutations described in Chapter 1, age is a predominant risk factor for the MPNs . In the UK HMRN study, the median age at diagnosis in people with chronic MPNs was 70-74 years (Table 2.4) . PV tended to be diagnosed at an earlier age in men than in women . Such familial cases are presumed to be due to acquisition of the somatic driver mutation through a genetic predisposition . Other risk factors for the MPNs have been proposed (Table 2.5), although in many cases the supporting evidence is limited . Two major long-term epidemiology studies have reported strong evidence that increased body mass index and smoking have significant associations with some or all of the MPNs .","The incidence of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is approximately 2.6 per 100 000. Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is the most common, with an incidence of approximately 1.0 per 100 000, followed by polycythemia vera (PV) (0.8) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (0.5). Recent data from the UK suggest that the incidence of ET and PV is similar in men and women, whereas PMF is twice as common in men. MPNs primarily affect older individuals: the median age at diagnosis is 70-74 years. ET and PV are associated with near-normal life expectancy whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. Risk factors that may increase the risk of MPNs include higher body mass index, smoking and some occupational exposures."
9781910797433,ch05,"In patients with presumed early disease, the aim of surgery is to remove the primary tumor, along with adequate peritoneal and lymphogenic staging . Depending on the histological grade and tumor subtype, up to 30% of patients with apparently early epithelial ovarian cancer will be upstaged after comprehensive peritoneal and lymph node staging . However, in this study, systematic lymph node dissection was not associated with a significant survival benefit compared with sampling alone, partly because of a lack of statistical power but also because of common use of chemotherapy in the sampling arm, which seemed to potentially compensate for the less radical dissection . Increasing evidence shows that the prevalence of positive lymph nodes in stage IA mucinous cancer is extremely low, and that there is no value in performing surgery that can lead to unnecessary morbidity . Patients with stage IA ovarian cancer and favorable histology (low-grade mucinous, serous, endometrioid or mixed histology) have been shown to have a lower risk after fertility-preserving surgery than patients with a higher disease stage or tumor grade . In large retrospective analyses, women with grade 3 disease or stage IC3 with clear cell histology had a higher risk of recurrence (Figure 5.2), which was mainly related to the higher incidence of extra-ovarian spread in grade 3 tumors rather than to a higher relapse rate in the preserved ovary . In advanced stages, maximal cytoreduction aimed at achieving complete tumor clearance has been shown to be associated with significant increases in both overall and progression-free survival . In order to achieve total macroscopic tumor clearance in peritoneally disseminated disease, a maximal surgical effort is required, incorporating multivisceral resection techniques such as . Two prospective randomized trials, have reported lower surgical morbidity and comparable survival when neoadjuvant therapy was given, compared with upfront surgery, but whether these findings can be generalized to patients with good performance status treated in specialized centers is unclear . The DESKTOP I trial retrospectively evaluated the survival benefit of secondary debulking in patients with ovarian cancer, sensitive to platinum chemotherapy . An exploratory analysis of the DESKTOP results to evaluate the role of peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer clearly showed that, even though peritoneal carcinomatosis was a negative predictor for complete resection in patients with recurrent disease, it appeared to have no independent negative impact on survival if total macroscopic clearance could be achieved . The prospective, multicenter DESKTOP II trial, subsequently validated the AGO score, confirming its usefulness and reliability for predicting the benefit of complete tumor resection in more than two-thirds of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer . A meta-analysis of data from 40 patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, spanning 24 years, showed that after controlling for all other disease-related factors, every 10% increase in the proportion of patients undergoing complete cytoreductive surgery was associated with a 3-month increase in median cohort survival time . This study confirmed that - even in the tertiary setting - complete macroscopic tumor clearance is a significant predictor of both overall and progression-free survival .","Surgery is one of the cornerstones of treatment for ovarian cancer. The key aims of surgery are tumor removal and accurate staging. Multivisceral surgery is needed to achieve complete tumor resection. Surgery for relapsed disease is associated with significant prolongation of progression-free survival in prospective studies; data for overall survival are not yet mature, but in retrospective series patients who are tumor free after surgery at relapse have significantly longer overall survival than those with residual tumor. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is associated with lower complete debulking rates at relapse, but not with inferior overall survival in tumor-free patients who undergo surgery."
9781910797617,chp1,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that affects the blood and bone marrow . One such example is the association of the PML-RARA fusion gene with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of AML (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3) . Patients with APL have a high risk for fatal hemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the consequence of a halt in myeloid differentiation that is mediated by the PML-RARA fusion gene . The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development . Genetic sequencing studies suggest that most cases of AML arise from a limited number of mutations that accumulate with age . gov) and other databases have shown that up to 5-6% of healthy individuals over 70 years of age have blood cells that contain potentially 'premalignant' mutations that are associated with clonal expansion (reviewed in TCGA Research Network 2013) . Sequencing data demonstrate the surprising finding that AML is associated with far fewer mutations than most other adult cancers: adults with AML have an average of 13 genetic mutations, in stark contrast to melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, which typically have several hundred, as illustrated in Figure 1.4 . Furthermore, genetic analysis of serial samples from patients suggests that the pathogenesis of the disease is (at least in most cases) not rooted in a single mutation but in complex relationships between the accumulated (but limited number of) mutations . Figure 1.5 shows the frequency of mutation for the most commonly mutated genes, which include FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH2 and IDH1, in a group of 200 patients with newly diagnosed AML . Sequencing studies suggest that the development of individualized therapies that target unique mutations in selected patients, rather than a 'one way fits all' chemotherapy approach (described in Chapter 3), may improve outcomes for patients with AML . These include familial risk, environmental exposure to chemicals, drugs or ionizing radiation, and antecedent hematologic disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) . Although most cases of AML are not familial, it is now clear that myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition (exempli gratia an inherited risk) are more frequent than has been recognized previously . Myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition - that is, AML and related disorders that arise in the setting of an inherited genetic mutation which puts the patient at increased risk for developing the disease - are an important component of the forthcoming revision to the World Health Organization classification of AML (see Table 2.3) . Germline mutations associated with an increased risk of developing a myeloid neoplasm occur in the CEBPA, DDX41, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6 and GATA2 genes, among others . Down syndrome-associated AML in young children (< 4 years) is typically of the acute megakaryocytic subtype (see Table 2.2 for the different morphologic subtypes) and is associated with a mutation in the GATA1 gene . Leukemias associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors typically occur 1-3 years after exposure; AML blasts in affected patients have a particular morphologic appearance with monocytic features .","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relatively rare cancer. It is due to proliferation of immature myeloid cells, which interfere with the production of normal red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients typically require transfusion support and are at risk for potentially fatal infection. AML is uniformly fatal without treatment. AML is the most common acute leukemia in older adults, with median age at diagnosis of 67-69 years. Long-term survival of patients with AML is poor: about a quarter of patients survive 5 years but only 10% of older patients. Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time. Most cases of AML are idiopathic; however, prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents increases the risk of AML. Inherited risk is uncommon but is likely to be more frequent than is currently understood."

The dominant abnormality is in the serum aminotransferases, which may be very high and in the range associated with acute hepatitis . Acute liver failure, hepatic infarction and rupture are all recognized complications . Renal failure and thrombocytopenia are other common features of severe disease . Management involves control of the hypertension and early termination of the pregnancy . There is considerable overlap between this syndrome and hypertension-related liver dysfunction, and management is effectively the same as for the latter condition (see above) . However, this has not been clearly demonstrated to be the case, and even the stresses of vaginal delivery are not associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage . In most cases, this will mean consideration of propranolol therapy, but occasionally individuals with mucosal stigmata associated with a high-risk status may require endoscopic intervention and obliteration of varices . Autoimmune hepatitis tends to be fairly quiescent during pregnancy, with flares in disease activity observed in fewer than 10% of cases . Coincidental acute liver disease . The clinical courses of hepatitis A and B are unaltered by pregnancy, but mortality is increased with hepatitis E . Pregnancy and the postpartum period are times of increased risk for the development of hepatic vein thrombosis in susceptible individuals . Biliary obstruction should be managed endoscopically rather than surgically during the pregnancy . Acute liver failure, unrelated to the pregnancy, may develop after deliberate or accidental paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, infection with hepatitis E or other coincidental reasons . Maternal care is standard for the condition, and successful liver transplants during pregnancy have been reported .","Three classic syndromes of liver dysfunction are associated with late pregnancy: acute fatty liver, hypertension/eclampsia-related dysfunction and HELLP syndrome, but considerable overlap exists between them. Cholestasis of pregnancy is a recurrent disorder which is associated with increased fetal mortality. Pregnancy is surprisingly well tolerated by women with chronic liver disease."
9781908541796,chapter1,"Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is clinically useful, it is now recognized that many of the broader categories, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, include several distinct entities, each of which may have its own unique epidemiological and etiologic profile . In the USA, Europe and Australasia the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is approximately 20 per 100 000 of the population, with a slightly higher incidence in men than in women . Overall, incidence increases with age, although some subtypes of lymphoma are more common in children and young adults (Table 1.1) . For example, mantle cell lymphoma particularly affects men (> 70% of cases), whereas primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is more common in women . In the USA, the incidence of NHL is 50% higher in non-Hispanic white Americans than black Americans . Overall, NHL is most common in the USA, Western Europe and Australia (possibly reflecting the age demographics of these populations) . However, Hodgkin lymphoma is considerably more common in the Middle East, with incidence rates almost double those of Western Europe . This rate of increase has only been surpassed by lung cancer in women and melanoma in both sexes for which specific etiologic factors have been identified (smoking and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, respectively) . Possible risk factors for lymphoma can be divided into two broad categories . common risk factors that carry a low relative risk . With the exception of HIV infection (see below), none of the possible risk factors is known to have changed over time . Indeed, HIV/AIDS has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of lymphoma, but it accounts for less than 50% of the increase in incidence seen in the West . Common risk factors with low relative risk . However, it must be remembered that a relatively innocuous environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk of developing lymphoma can contribute substantially to a rising incidence if a sufficiently large number of people are exposed . Nevertheless, it is not possible to test for every environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk . HIV infection increases the risk of developing NHL more than 100-fold . Patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs following solid organ transplantation are at 30-50-fold increased risk of developing NHL; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is often a cofactor . Certain inflammatory conditions predispose to the development of NHL and particularly extranodal marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, which are associated with organ-specific autoimmune conditions . Some studies have also demonstrated an association between specific pesticides and herbicides and NHL subtypes but, again, the results are inconsistent . Only a small (and therefore difficult to demonstrate) relative risk may account for a significant proportion of lymphoma cases . EBV actively replicates within the cell, causing it to lyse and shed virus, resulting in the familiar sore throat of glandular fever . In each case, a cofactor such as EBV is needed for lymphoma development .","The epidemiology of lymphoma is difficult to study owing to the existence of so many different subtypes of the disease, each with its own epidemiology and associated causative factors. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s but has plateaued in recent years. An understanding of the epidemiology has, in some instances, led to an understanding of causative factors such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Various other subtypes of lymphoma have been linked with infection, particularly immunosuppression-related lymphomas caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas caused by various bacterial infections. Large cohort studies are required to verify many of the potential causative factors."
9781908541963,chapter2,"Acute liver disease refers to diseases of less than 6 months' duration at the time of presentation . This category of disease excludes first presentations of cirrhosis, with a few exceptions, such as when hepatitis B or Wilson's disease present with the syndrome of acute liver failure . Jaundice is the typical presentation of both hepatitis and cholestasis; the sudden onset of ascites is the most common presentation of vascular disease . Acute liver failure is a life-threatening complication of acute hepatitis and a number of other liver diseases (Wilson's disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, Budd-Chiari syndrome and Amanita phalloides mushroom poisoning) . The definition of acute liver failure is based on the development of encephalopathy within 12 weeks of the onset of jaundice . Patients at risk of acute liver failure are identified by the development of a coagulopathy, and encephalopathy typically develops on the third or fourth day after the overdose . Renal failure is more common and earlier than with other causes of acute liver failure . Progression to acute liver failure is usually prevented by the administration of N -acetylcysteine within 16-24 hours of the overdose . Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism, may present with many of the clinical features of acute liver failure . The liver function profile comprises elevated serum bilirubin, serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT but no features that distinguish intrahepatic from extrahepatic biliary obstruction . Hepatic vein thrombosis, or Budd-Chiari syndrome, may have an acute presentation with abdominal pain and massive ascites . A coagulopathy indicates that the liver insult is severe and the patient is at risk of acute liver failure . Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with established cirrhosis, those showing manifestations of acute liver failure and those whose condition deteriorates after shunting . Veno-occlusive disease is clinically similar to the Budd-Chiari syndrome, but the main hepatic veins are patent and the obstruction occurs in the small hepatic venules . Viral infections and drug reactions account for most cases of acute hepatitis with an identifiable cause (Table 2.2) . The onset of acute liver failure is signaled by the onset of encephalopathy (a neurological syndrome ranging in severity from drowsiness and poor concentration to coma) . Childhood infection usually causes a non-specific illness; the likelihood of developing jaundice increases with age at acquisition . The risk of developing acute liver failure is only 0.1% overall, increasing exponentially with age . Vaccination against hepatitis A is effective and is advised for travelers to endemic areas, individuals at occupational risk, patients with chronic liver disease and men who have sex with men . An increasing number of antiviral agents have become available for the treatment of patients with acute hepatitis B . This entity occurs particularly in patients developing acute liver failure . Hepatitis C is rarely identified as a cause of acute hepatitis . Leptospirosis or Weil's disease is an unusual cause of acute hepatitis, typically acquired by contact with rat's urine . Idiosyncratic reactions leading to hepatitis may follow exposure to a wide range of drugs; some of the more common causes are listed in Table 2.2 .","Attempt to classify acute liver disease as hepatitis (most common), cholestatic (intermediate) or vascular (unusual). Simple blood tests and an ultrasound examination provide most of the information required. Hypoglycemia, coagulopathy and any evidence of confusion indicate a high risk of acute liver failure and the need for specialist care. Coagulopathy in cholestatic disorders responds to parenteral vitamin K."
9781910797907,chp2,"Despite being the best studied of the glycolytic enzyme disorders, gaps remain in our understanding of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency . More than 600 cases of PK deficiency have been reported, mainly from Europe, the USA and Japan, but the disease occurs worldwide, and it is likely that many cases go unreported . Prevalence of pyruvate kinase deficiency . A study in northern England observed a prevalence of 3.3 cases of PK deficiency per million in a mainly white population . Gene frequency studies have estimated the prevalence of PK deficiency in the general white population to be 51 cases per million . In Germany and the USA, it has been estimated that about 1% of the population are heterozygous for PK deficiency, while a study from Hong Kong found that 3% of newborn infants were heterozygous for a particular PK variant . Because PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, individuals who are heterozygous for a single PK mutation will not show clinical signs of hemolysis or anemia . For this reason, prevalence estimates based on the observation of clinically affected patients will be substantially lower than those based on the prevalence of heterozygotes in a population . The Amish community in Pennsylvania, USA, has a particularly high frequency of PK deficiency, associated with one specific mutation, which can be traced back to a single immigrant couple . Mutations associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency . As discussed in Chapter 1, mutations in the PKLR gene on chromosome 1 are responsible for PK deficiency . Although many of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are rare, a few are recorded more frequently (Table 2.1) . The variability in how PK deficiency manifests is thought to reflect the heterogeneity of these causative mutations, as well as the fact that most individuals with PK deficiency will be compound heterozygotes (id est they will have a different mutation in each copy of the PKLR gene) . Approximately 70% of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense (M) mutations (id est a single nucleotide change resulting in the production of a different amino acid), while the others are more disruptive non-missense (NM) mutations - either nonsense or insertional mutations, deletions (such as the deletion of exon 11 found in the Romany population), or splicing abnormalities (see pages 43 -) . Current research is focusing on the relationship between specific mutations in the PKLR gene and the severity of hemolysis . Given the sheer number of different mutations and the predominance of compound heterozygotes, studies of the relationship between genotype and phenotype have grouped patients by type of mutation (id est two missense mutations [M/M], one missense and one non-missense mutation [M/NM], or two non-missense mutations [NM/NM]) . Acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency . While almost all cases of PK deficiency are inherited and result from mutations in the PKLR gene, an acquired form of the deficiency can very rarely occur secondarily to other blood diseases, such as acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory sideroblastic anemia . Acquired PK deficiency can also result from complications associated with chemotherapy .",Gaps remain in our understanding of the epidemiology of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency because many cases are believed to go unreported. About one quarter of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency will have a previously unrecorded mutation in the PKLR gene. Approximately 70% of mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense mutations. Some mutations are seen more frequently in specific regions and populations. Acquired PK deficiency very rarely can occur secondarily to other blood diseases.
9781908541666,ch_9,"Dietary recommendations for the last 30 years in diabetes mellitus have emphasized a diet low in saturated fat . Macronutrient breakdown consisted of less than 30% of energy intake from fat (with less than 10% from saturated sources), 50-60% of energy from carbohydrates and 20% from protein . The imperative for a low saturated fat intake in diabetes was (and still is) mandated by the need to limit dietary cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular risk . Some low GI foods may be helpful in preventing between-meal hypoglycemia, particularly in those patients using isophane and short-acting insulins . Individual need should be considered again: if obesity is an issue and weight loss is desired, energy intake reduction may be compromised if there is increased energy intake by increased consumption of fat, even if it is of high quality . In the patient with excellent or tight glycemic control, insulin or hypoglycemic drugs may require dose reduction with carbohydrate intake reduction, particularly if omitted from any particular meal . Thus, dietary intake in type 2 diabetes can be flexible in macronutrient intake; the emphasis on a low intake of saturated animal and vegetable fats remains . Insulin-treated patients (type 1 or type 2 diabetes) receiving meal-time quick-acting insulin (either singly or in a premixed form) need to eat carbohydrate at that meal . It is useful to refer to standard portion sizes or exchanges of carbohydrates for patients, and ensure the premeal insulin dose covers the carbohydrate sufficiently to prevent postmeal hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia . Nevertheless, some patients will need to consume a snack, such as a glass of milk or a piece of fruit, at bedtime to prevent overnight hypoglycemia; other times of risk are mid morning or afternoon . Care needs to be exercised not to increase total energy intake substantially, otherwise weight gain may occur . If hypoglycemia regularly occurs at the same time, it would be reasonable to reduce the preceding dose of insulin or, if possible, consider changing the insulin type . Food labels will indicate to patients the total energy, fat and carbohydrate content of any particular food . Another useful strategy is reducing or restricting between-meal snacks in those patients not at risk of hypoglycemia . With energy restriction, the potential for hypoglycemia with the patient's drug therapy should be considered . Patients treated with sulfonylureas or insulin are at risk and may require dose reduction when undertaking energy restriction . The doses of hypoglycemic agents and insulin should be reduced when starting this form of eating plan (by 30-50%), and the patient should be warned that hypoglycemia may still develop; further reductions in medication are often required, generally within 1-4 weeks . Therefore, insulin-treated patients may need to reduce insulin doses for subsequent meals and even the overnight long-acting insulin dose . Some patients may reduce insulin doses prior to the planned exercise too . Patients should be encouraged to monitor glucose levels after exercise and snack as necessary . Some patients may need a carbohydrate snack prior to the exercise bout .","Diet for healthy weight and optimized glucose control is one of the cornerstones of diabetes self-care. Increased physical activity and reduced sedentariness are fundamental to physical health and healthy weight in diabetes control. Suitable management plans for people with diabetes will include addressing nutrition and physical activity, using the skill sets of allied health professionals including dietitians and exercise physiologists, where available. If these specialists are not available or easily accessible, others involved in patient care, including general practitioners, diabetes educators and endocrinologists are ideally placed to provide lifestyle advice to people with diabetes."
9781912776153,chp11,"In some cases this leads to an arrhythmia that can cause sudden death in an apparently healthy individual with a structurally normal heart . A long QT interval (or, rarely, a pathologically short QT interval) predisposes an individual to ventricular arrhythmias, usually a polymorphic (non-uniform) ventricular tachycardia (VT) known as torsades de pointes (see page 136) . In the long QT syndrome (LQTS), both potassium and sodium channels are affected, resulting in prolonged repolarization . Congenital long QT syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization on the ECG and a propensity to ventricular arrhythmias . Presentation may vary from merely prolongation of the QT interval being noted on the 12-lead ECG in an asymptomatic individual, to recurrent syncope or resuscitated sudden death . Acquired long QT syndrome is most commonly either drug-induced or due to a profound biochemical abnormality, usually hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia . Over the years, many drugs have been withdrawn from general use because of complications associated with QT prolongation and increased risk of sudden death (exempli gratia cisapride, terodiline) . The short QT syndrome has been reported to occur in association with atrial fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, and represents another cardiac channelopathy . It is a rare syndrome characterized by sudden death due to idiopathic VF in an otherwise apparently structurally normal heart . More than 80 mutations in the sodium-channel gene have been identified in patients with Brugada syndrome . An ICD is the treatment of choice in patients with syncope, resuscitated sudden death or inducible ventricular arrhythmias . Electrophysiological testing may be useful in asymptomatic cases (exempli gratia patients in whom Brugada syndrome is found incidentally) to assess the risk of sudden death . Patients with documented VF with an otherwise normal heart should undergo a provocation test using intravenous administration of a sodium-channel blocker such as ajmaline (a short-acting class I agent) or flecainide during 12-lead ECG recording . Lists of drugs that should be avoided by patients with Brugada syndrome can be found at . Patients presenting with resuscitated sudden death are at highest risk of recurrence . Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a rare but important cause of VT and sudden death, particularly in young men; in particular, it causes tachycardia on vigorous exercise . Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is due to genetic abnormalities in the desmosome regions of myocytes (the desmosomes link cardiac cells and confer strength) . Abnormal myocardial architecture and fiber disarray contribute to increased risk of VF in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Five factors have been associated with an increased risk of sudden death, and such patients should be considered for an ICD . Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a rare genetic abnormality, first described in children, which causes syncope and sudden death due to bidirectional or polymorphic VT following exercise or stress . In the event of an unexplained sudden cardiac death, particularly at a young age, the possibility of a genetic cause should be considered and investigated as part of a 'molecular' postmortem (see page 50) .","An arrhythmic cause should be considered in younger patients presenting with 'epilepsy' - a resting electrocardiogram (ECG) is mandatory. ECG changes may be intermittent; a normal baseline ECG may not exclude these conditions. Several forms of congenital long QT syndrome have been described, the most well-characterized of which - LQT1, LQT2 and LQT3 - each have distinct clinical outcomes, ECG appearances and triggers. Brugada syndrome is characterized by sudden death due to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation; ECG changes may be intermittent, but an abnormality resembling incomplete or complete right bundle branch block pattern with persistent ST elevation in the precordial chest leads (V1-V3) is diagnostic. Most cases of acquired long QT syndrome are drug-related. Patients with known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy require cardiological assessment. In many cases, screening of family members is mandatory and, if available, referral to a specialized genetics clinic should be made."
9781908541468,ch_9,"Glomerular or tubular involvement may be a major feature of systemic autoimmune diseases, and may result from the deposition of abnormal proteins in dysproteinemias . Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease that is most common in young women and often affects the joints, skin, nervous system and kidneys . class III - focal lupus nephritis . Lupus nephritis can present with any of the clinical syndromes described earlier, depending on the severity of glomerular injury . There is good evidence for using a combination of prednisolone and pulsed cyclophosphamide as initial therapy, followed by azathioprine for maintenance in class III and IV lupus nephritis . Since the disease runs a relapsing and remitting course, maintenance therapy, often with low-dose prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil, is generally required . Primary vasculitides affecting small blood vessels, which include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis and, less commonly, Churg-Strauss syndrome, often cause glomerulonephritis . Patients generally present with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, although in some patients there may be repeated episodes of less severe renal disease, leading to glomerular scarring together with active lesions . Patients with severe kidney failure or other life-threatening features of disease are generally treated with additional intravenous methylprednisolone and/or plasma exchange . There is evidence that plasma exchange may be more effective than methylprednisolone in salvaging kidney function in patients with advanced kidney failure . Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a form of thrombotic microangiopathy, with a tendency to affect the kidney . No good trials of treatment have been reported in HUS, though plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma has been shown to be effective in TTP . Systemic sclerosis may affect the kidney by causing an obstructive vasculopathy of small renal arteries - so-called 'scleroderma kidney' . Systemic sclerosis of the kidney presents with subacute or acute renal impairment . Although systemic features of scleroderma are generally present (exempli gratia thickening of the skin, telangiectasia, esophageal dysfunction), kidney involvement may occasionally be the presenting feature . The typical kidney lesion is a granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis, which can lead to functional impairment . Type I cryoglobulins are more likely to result in kidney damage through high viscosity or intravascular deposition . Treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in type I cryoglobulinemia generally involves plasma exchange to reduce paraprotein levels, together with appropriate chemotherapy . Plasma exchange may be helpful in removing circulating cryoglobulins in the most severe disease, and can be combined with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide therapy . Type III cryoglobulins are generally related to an underlying autoimmune disease or chronic infection . They rarely cause severe renal disease . The commonest forms affecting the kidney are AL amyloid, in which Ig light chains are involved, and AA amyloid, in which amyloid A protein produced by chronic inflammation is involved . Amyloid deposition in the kidney commonly results in nephrotic syndrome, usually associated with progressive renal impairment . Atherosclerotic renovascular disease is an increasingly important cause of established kidney failure in the elderly . Perhaps of greater importance, atheroma of the renal artery can lead to cholesterol embolization of intrarenal vessels or glomeruli, which often causes irreversible kidney failure .","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly causes kidney disease, which can be severe and requires immunosuppression. Vasculitis is common in the elderly and can be successfully treated if diagnosed early. Long-term treatment is usually needed for both vasculitis and SLE with kidney involvement. Atheromatous renal vascular disease is very common and reflects widespread arterial pathology."
9781910797662,ch09,"Most non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is low or intermediate risk (low-grade Ta), can be managed endoscopically and requires only limited further assessment or treatment . Advances in the near future will probably include systemic immunotherapy, if these treatments are shown to improve control or cure and reduce recurrence and progression, with an acceptable safety profile and cost-effectiveness . More accurate imaging modalities may allow better detection and management of residual or micrometastatic disease, with consequent improvements in the stratification of patients into more appropriate treatment pathways . better understanding of the biology of bladder cancer and consequent treatment selection, such as the identification of biomarkers that reliably predict who should receive immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy and markers that would point to a higher probability of response in subsequent lines of therapy . high-level evidence of meaningful clinical benefit, particularly improved survival and quality of life, which have yet to be reported from early trials of immunotherapies . rational combinations of existing therapy, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, or integration of small-molecule kinase inhibitors, possibly in selected patients based on characterization of tumor biology . Several relevant biomarkers for risk stratification and prediction of response to treatment of bladder cancer are being explored (exempli gratia FGFR, VEGFR, HER2, circulating tumor DNA) and some (exempli gratia PD-L1) are beginning to be used in clinical practice in the hope that this might increase the probability that patients receiving treatments aimed at such targets will respond to them; however, uptake of such assays remains limited on a global scale and it is not yet clear whether their use improves outcomes . Better technology in this arena, including tests that are less invasive than cystoscopy or biopsy and therefore more acceptable to patients, will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and reduction of costs . However, incorporation of these assays into clinical practice requires care, particularly if the tissue was not obtained recently (exempli gratia past cystectomy) or is not representative of the cancer (exempli gratia small endoscopic biopsy of a bladder tumor in a patient with widespread metastatic disease) . The number of potential permutations and combinations of existing and future therapies is daunting, and becomes even more challenging when the various stages of bladder cancer are considered, and the ways in which initial treatment selection may affect subsequent sequencing of treatments . For example, if high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease relapses after systemic immunotherapy, should the patient then receive similar therapy for metastatic disease? One simple approach would be an opt-in process whereby patients consent to clinical information collected in the context of routine care, and tissue samples surplus to diagnostic requirements, being made available for future research . This relates to improvement in quality of life through better control of symptoms, reduction in treatment-related toxicity, improved management of comorbidities and involvement of other disciplines such as exercise physiology, where improvements in cancer-specific outcomes can also be shown . A further benefit from this approach is the focus on reducing and managing the toxicities of treatment, with consequent improvements in response (and potentially cure) rates as well . improved identification and appropriate streaming of patients through the healthcare system, and management of treatment side-effects .","Public health preventative measures are likely to have the greatest influence on bladder cancer outcomes globally. Earlier diagnosis will shift the pattern of disease towards more favorable stage and grade cancers. Outcomes in advanced disease are likely to improve through the uptake of new therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as better application of existing evidence and treatments. Improved biological characterization of tumors may point towards more appropriate and patient-specific treatments, including those aimed at specific molecular targets. Multidisciplinary management and extended supportive and palliative care measures will increasingly be adopted and improve cancer outcomes and quality of life."
9781910797211,ch04,"Patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately, although in some cases a delayed effect is seen after prolonged treatment . The STRIDE-PD study was a prospective 134-week double-blind trial comparing the risk of developing dyskinesias in 747 Parkinson's disease patients randomized to either levodopa and carbidopa (LC) or levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone (LCE), administered four times daily at 3.5-hour intervals . Intraduodenal/jejunal infusion of levodopa offers an alternative route of administration in very advanced Parkinson's disease when other treatments have failed, and in patients not suitable for deep brain stimulation (see Table 5.3) or apomorphine (see pages 73 -) . Three studies have investigated the efficacy of this formulation in patients with Parkinson's disease (see below); however, no sleep benefit has been found, and the long-term consequences of this dosing with levodopa is unknown . The APEX-PD study, a phase 3 randomized double-blind fixed-dose placebo-controlled trial, investigated the safety and efficacy of ER CD-LD in levodopa-naÃ¯ve patients with early Parkinson's disease . The ADVANCE-PD study, a double-blind active-control parallel-group randomized phase 3 study, compared the efficacy and safety of ER CD-LD with immediate-release (IR) CD-LD in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations . ER CD-LD significantly improved the control of motor symptoms compared with IR CD-LD in several clinical measures including the UPDRS, Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGI), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 and modified Rankin test . The ASCEND-PD study, a randomized double-blind two-period crossover trial, compared ER CD-LD with carbidopa-levodopa in combination with the COMT inhibitor entacapone (CD-LD-E) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations . Ropinirole and pramipexole are well-established non-ergot dopamine agonists in widespread clinical use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease . A direct beneficial effect of pramipexole on depressive symptoms, accounting for 80% of total treatment effect, was found in a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the drug in 287 mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease patients with depressive symptoms . Rotigotine is the first transdermally delivered non-ergot dopamine agonist shown to be effective in early and advanced Parkinson's disease . Daytime sleepiness is, therefore, likely to be a combined effect of the disease process and dopaminergic drug treatment, and not a novel event related solely to the use of dopamine agonists . A combined formulation of entacapone, decarboxylase inhibitor and levodopa has been licensed for use in the USA, Europe and certain parts of Asia; the drug should make adherence easier for patients taking entacapone and is likely to be administered for treatment of early 'wearing-off' symptoms . All patients with Parkinson's disease who require drug treatment should be given the opportunity to make an informed choice from the range of treatment options available, including dopamine agonists, other levodopa-sparing agents, levodopa and combination therapy . However, the results of the PD Med study, a multicenter real-life pragmatic study, reporting on quality of life-related outcomes in both young and old patients with Parkinson's disease, is likely to generate considerable controversy regarding the use of dopamine agonists and the choice of initial therapy .","Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately. Fear over the toxicity of levodopa has resulted in levodopa phobia in some patients; however, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. Dopamine agonists are useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa therapy; some, such as rotigotine, may offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation in practice and specifically offer night-time and early morning benefit. Treatment decisions should be based on the degree of disability, occupational needs, age, patient/clinician preference and adherence issues; neuroprotection remains a theoretical argument, while dyskinesias and wearing off are an important consideration in younger patients. Trial data indicate that treatment of Parkinson's disease could be initiated with levodopa, oral dopamine agonists or a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor. The PD MED study seems to suggest that initial therapy with levodopa offers a small but persistent benefit compared with the alternatives, and initial MAOB inhibitor treatment is at least as effective as a dopamine agonist. The findings of the PDLIFE study suggest that early initiation of treatment may be beneficial in terms of health-related quality of life. Impuse control disorders have emerged as a major complication of mostly dopamine agonist treatment, and monitoring is a must. The treatment of non-motor symptoms is important at all stages of Parkinson's disease. The results of the PANDA study may help people with Parkinson's-associated pain."
9781908541727,ch03,"Patients complain of sudden or subacute blurring of vision or visual field loss in one eye . It is important to remember that retinal venous occlusions are often warning signs of previously undetected or undertreated hypertension, diabetes, raised pressure in the eye (glaucoma), or (in young patients) coagulopathy . Any diabetic patient complaining of new-onset floaters (with or without blurred vision) should be taken especially seriously, because of the high risk that new vessels are bleeding . Most AMD is 'dry' (that is, no abnormal new vessels are present) and results in gradually progressive loss of central vision . The disease presents as sudden visual loss with a swollen optic disc, which is painless (unless there is a headache associated with temporal arteritis) . If the patient develops blurred vision with a 'white' eye soon after eye surgery, they could have retinal detachment, or a swelling of the macula called cystoid macular edema . Patients suspected of having one of the diseases in this section can be referred routinely unless one or more of the criteria for urgent referral are present (exempli gratia flashes, floaters, visual field defect or RAPD) . Cataract usually occurs in the elderly, or in younger patients with diabetes, intraocular inflammation or eye trauma . Visual fields are full to confrontation, there is no RAPD, the eyes look normal externally (apart from a gray rather than black pupil in cases of advanced cataract) and there may be a dulling of the red reflex . Chronic glaucoma causes slow, painless loss of vision, which is usually not noticed by the patient because peripheral vision is lost first . The eyes of a patient with chronic glaucoma appear entirely normal on examination, apart from raised intraocular pressure (in most but not all patients) and characteristic 'cupping' of one or both optic discs (Figure 3.7) . Do not confuse this condition with acute glaucoma, which is much rarer and presents with a painful red eye and blurred vision (see Chapter 2) . Patients who have advanced diabetic maculopathy that has not been detected by screening complain of blurred vision and metamorphopsia . Because of the high risk of serious retinal disease, diabetic patients who complain of acute or subacute onset of blurred vision or visual distortion require urgent referral . In the elderly, age-related changes in the macula often cause gradual, usually mild-to-moderate, loss of vision, although in some cases it can also cause severe visual loss . Although rare, chronic macular edema and retinal detachment can also occur, as can other eye disease completely unrelated to the cataract surgery . Transient visual loss in both eyes simultaneously is most commonly caused by the binocular 'scintillating scotoma' that occurs before the onset of headache in many patients with migraine . Papilledema (bilateral optic disc swelling due to raised intracranial pressure) can also cause fading out of vision in one or both eyes, usually for seconds at a time .","Most patients with blurred vision have benign, slowly progressive conditions and can be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. However, blurred vision may also be the first symptom of potentially sight- or life-threatening disease, and patients suspected of having a serious cause of blurred vision must be referred urgently. All people over 40 should be encouraged to have regular eye checks by their optometrist to look for early signs of glaucoma and other eye disease. Chronic glaucoma is usually asymptomatic until it is very advanced. Please check that all your practice's diabetic patients are enrolled for regular eye screening to detect diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy is best treated at an asymptomatic stage to prevent visual loss. Always consider temporal arteritis if a patient over 50 complains of sudden loss of vision or transient blurring of vision."
9783318068207,hh-8,"In this setting, careful attention should be paid to pre-analytic factors that can adversely affect the quality and quantity of nucleic acids in the sample, leading to uninterpretable molecular results . FFPE histological samples represent the gold standard starting material from which to extract nucleic acids for molecular analysis . FFPE specimens contain a high quantity of material for both morphological evaluation and ancillary techniques and do not require additional molecular validation, unlike cytological samples . Cytological preparations (direct smears and liquid-based cytology), in contrast to FFPE samples, do not suffer the histological issues related to formalin fixation (cytological specimens are air dried or alcohol fixed), cold ischemia or paraffin storage (Table 6.2) . Molecular reports should be short and easy to interpret, focusing on the main information that could be of interest for the patient's clinical management . The body of the text should report, in a brief and clear manner, the main characteristics of samples (percentage of neoplastic cells, fixation problems, presence of contaminant that can limit the analysis) and the information regarding the mutational status of the analyzed biomarkers . As recommended by the AMP, ASCO and CAP, a four-tiered system for the interpretation and reporting of variants in cancer should be adopted, in particular when tested using large NGS panels (Table 6.3) . It is also important to report as 'wild type' the absence of mutations in clinically relevant genes (tier I) . Information about the methods - the type of test adopted, the reference range, the limit of detection (LOD) and the NGS parameters applied - should be included at the end of the report . Molecular tumor boards are multidisciplinary groups of professionals involved in the management of cancer patients, such as molecular pathologists, clinicians, surgeons, radiologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians and biologists . At each meeting, the MTB discusses the correct management of individual cancer patients . It is the role of the MTB to decipher the complexity of the cancer genomic landscape and translate it into information useful for patient management . As well as therapeutic strategies, the meeting provides an opportunity to solve other kinds of problems, such as the type of sample that should be analyzed, the molecular technique and gene panel that should be adopted and the interpretation of molecular results, which is particularly important when unclear or doubtful data have been reported . Second, MTBs should comprise, as a minimum, clinicians (all specialists involved in the patient's cancer management), pathologists (including molecular pathologists), biologists, geneticists (particularly when considering the presence of germline variants) and bioinformaticians . reported that the cost of NGS analysis could be reduced by adopting a narrow custom gene panel covering 568 hotspot mutations in six genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, KIT and PDGFRA) . Besides the different gene panels and platforms, it is important to consider the healthcare system in which these technologies are adopted and the reimbursement system for molecular tests . In addition, costs rise if a large number of laboratories perform molecular tests on a relatively low number of samples .",Different sample types (histological or cytological) have distinct advantages and disadvantages; these are a key issue in molecular analysis. Standardization in molecular reporting is very important. Discussing a patient's results and management at an MTB meeting may help to overcome challenging issues. Laboratories should pay careful attention to costs and reimbursement systems for molecular analysis.
9781908541024,ch_8,"Despite these pathological differences, gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas have similar clinical and radiographic features . Gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas are uncommon, accounting for about 1.4% of all primary brain tumors, and typically present in patients under the age of 30 years . Epilepsy is the most common symptom because gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas both have a predilection for the cerebral hemispheres . When these tumors arise in other areas of the central nervous system they can produce a variety of symptoms, dependent on their location . The CT and MRI features of gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas are striking . On CT scans, they appear as well-demarcated, cystic and partially calcified isodense masses that often enhance with contrast administration . MRI reveals a hypointense lesion with variable contrast enhancement on T1-weighted images, and a hyperintense lesion on T2-weighted images (Figure 7.2) . The initial management of gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas is surgery, with the goal of gross total resection of all accessible hemispheric tumors . The role of radiotherapy in managing these tumors is controversial . Some experts recommend radiotherapy for midline gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas and for tumors with an anaplastic glial element, based on retrospective data suggesting a worse outcome for these subsets of patients . Central neurocytomas constitute approximately 0.25% of all primary brain tumors . These tumors usually present in individuals aged 20-40 years . The radiographic appearance of central neurocytomas is characteristic (Figure 7.3) . They are typically calcified, partially cystic isointense or hyperintense masses located in the anterior compartment of the ventricles, with variable contrast enhancement on T1- and T2-weighted MRI scans . Characteristically, the enhancing border of the tumor is sharply demarcated from the surrounding ventricles . Complete surgical resection is required for central neurocytomas . Dysplastic gangliocytoma is a rare disorder combining neoplastic and malformative features . Contrast enhancement is not a typical feature . Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor is a rare and recently described entity that comprises a dysplastic mass of bundles of axons, surrounded by oligodendrocytes and neurons suspended in an interstitial fluid . Surgical resection of the lesion is the only indicated treatment and, in the vast majority of patients, this cures the epileptic seizures . There is no role for radiotherapy or chemotherapy, as recurrence or malignant transformation has yet to be reported for this disorder . Patients typically present with an enlarged head and other features of hydrocephalus, and also seizures . These tumors are confined to the cerebral hemispheres, and MRI usually reveals a massive multicystic multilobulated mass with a solid component extending to the cortical surface . Enhancement with contrast is often seen within the solid elements and, rarely, in the walls of the cystic components . As with all glial-neuronal tumors, initial management comprises maximal surgical resection of the tumor . Postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy has often been administered following subtotal resection, because the tumor has the potential for aggressive biological behavior . For patients undergoing macroscopically radical resections, further immediate therapy can be withheld because the prognosis associated with this tumor is usually good .",Neuronal tumors are uncommon brain neoplasms typically diagnosed in children and young adults. The principal management of neuronal tumors is surgical; total or subtotal resection can be associated with long-term tumor control. The behavior of these tumors can be unpredictable and remains poorly understood because of their rarity.
9781910797105,ch05,"Developmental theories and environmental factors . Is schizophrenia a degenerative brain disorder, as originally thought by Kraepelin, or is it better viewed as non-progressive? On the basis of the range of observations outlined in Table 5.1, it was suggested that a static lesion, either genetic or environmental in origin during brain development, expressed its effects as a function of the maturational stage of the brain . In schizophrenia, the characteristic symptoms emerge only during the final stages of brain development in adolescence, when normal 'pruning' or elimination of excess synapses takes place . It is now known that schizophrenia results in part from a developmentally regulated disconnection of higher order association areas, through alterations in neuronal migration, synapse formation and myelination . Neurodevelopmental risk factors . Some established risk factors act early in life (Table 5.2) . Obstetric complications generally appear to increase the risk of schizophrenia . During pregnancy, risk factors include rubella and influenza infections in the first or second trimester and antepartum bleeding . Asphyxia and low birth weight, especially with intrauterine growth retardation, are risk factors at birth, as are certain brain insults and infections in childhood . Early developmental delays . Longitudinal follow-up studies of large birth cohorts have shown that the 1-2% of the sample who go on to develop adult schizophrenia show slight delays in motor, speech and intellectual milestones compared with the rest of the cohort . Certain problems, such as developmental receptive language disorders, are particularly linked to later schizophrenia . These developmental delays do not occur in bipolar disorder . The so-called secondary schizophrenias fit less easily into the neurodevelopmental formulation . The psychotic symptoms in these cases appear to be caused by a primary organic disorder, either a known physical disorder or a clinically unsuspected brain lesion . Table 5.3 lists those medical conditions in which a clear or possible association with schizophrenia-like disorders has been reported . These disorders are more common than previously realized, accounting for perhaps 2-3% of first-onset cases . Clinically recommended screening investigations for first-episode schizophrenia are outlined in Table 5.4 . Use of cannabis and amphetamine-like drugs has long been known to be an important trigger of relapse, but had not been thought to directly cause the onset of illness . However, several cohort studies since 2000 have shown that use of cannabis doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia . The risk is further increased if minor psychotic symptoms pre-exist and if cannabis use starts early in adolescence . Research suggests that this effect of cannabis may be mediated by a particular gene . Those with a specific version of the catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene, carried by about a quarter of the general population, appear to be especially prone to psychosis after cannabis use . Delta-9-THC, the active component of cannabis, disrupts learning and recall in schizophrenia . Psychosocial risk factors . There is emerging evidence for the role of non-biological risk factors in schizophrenia, such as the effects of urban upbringing and of ethnicity, as noted in Chapter 3 .","Early neurodevelopmental, non-genetic risk factors exist for schizophrenia. Like genetic factors, environmental factors are many and varied. Birth complications increase the child's risk of schizophrenia in later life fourfold. Psychosocial risk factors are being re-established as important risk factors. Cannabis use increases the risk of schizophrenia as well as relapse. Evidence for specific gene-environment interactions is beginning to emerge."
9781908541420,ch_5,"The presence of symptoms, however, is not by itself sufficient for a diagnosis of asthma; the history of symptoms and possible provocative factors must also be considered (Table 3.1), and the diagnosis confirmed by objective measures of lung function . Measurements of lung function provide an objective assessment of airflow limitation, and its variability and reversibility, and thus are valuable in the diagnosis and management of asthma . Measurements widely used in patients over 5 years of age are forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) . For asthma diagnosis, spirometry is usually assessed before and after the administration of an inhaled short-acting beta -agonist (SABA): responsiveness of FEV by 12% or 200 mL (whichever is the greater) is indicative of asthma . Measurement of bronchial responsiveness can be useful in the diagnosis of asthma, although there is some overlap between the range of values found in patients with asthma and in those with rhinitis or other causes of lower airway obstruction, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) . The presence of eosinophils at greater than 3% of non-squamous cells is indicative of eosinophilic inflammation in the airways and 'Th2-high' asthma . The concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air can be used as a surrogate measure for airway inflammation in asthma . Exhaled NO levels are therefore generally interpreted in terms of cut points in patients with symptoms that suggest airway inflammation (Table 3.4) . Therefore, in patients with asthma symptoms, a high level of exhaled NO would suggest the need for additional corticosteroid therapy or to check adherence to current regimens . By contrast, low levels of exhaled NO indicate poorer corticosteroid responsiveness, and in some patients it may be appropriate to consider a dose reduction . For the diagnosis of asthma, the results should always be interpreted in relation to the patient's history and the relationship between asthma symptoms and allergen exposure, because up to 45% of the population may exhibit atopy but only a proportion of these individuals will have asthma . The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult in certain patient groups, especially smokers and the extremely young or old, who may have difficulty performing lung function tests . A history of asthma in childhood and variability on spirometry or PEF testing with beta -agonists supports the diagnosis . Seasonal asthma associated with very high levels of aeroallergens may present as intermittent symptoms, with the patient being asymptomatic between seasons, or as seasonal worsening of moderate or severe asthma . Lung function tests and measurement of bronchial responsiveness with some form of challenge test are particularly important in these patients . The keys to diagnosing asthma are the patient's history together with measurements of lung function through spirometry and airway variability . A combination of symptom measurements and lung function tests can be used to classify asthma according to its severity (Figure 3.5) . These clinical measures of disease severity have been shown to correlate well with pathological markers of airway inflammation such as eosinophil numbers .","Although asthma is one of the most common chronic disorders, it is often underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The clinical diagnosis of asthma is often based on the presence of symptoms, such as breathlessness (often episodic), wheezing, chest tightness and coughing. A key feature is variation of symptoms over time, especially diurnal variation. Objective measures of lung function are important in order to establish asthma as a diagnosis and to assess response to treatment. Measurement of bronchial responsiveness and allergy status can aid diagnosis as well as identify possible exacerbating factors. Attempts should be made to assess disease control to guide treatment. The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult in certain patient groups, particularly those who smoke and the very young or old."
9781908541680,ch_6,"From a practical standpoint it is therefore important to determine for any particular patient where energy intake can be reduced and the nutritional quality of the diet improved without causing a significant disruption to lifestyle . For healthy long-term weight loss and weight maintenance, the food selected should have a high nutrient density but low energy density . Many epidemiological studies have shown that a relatively high intake of dietary fat, in particular saturated (animal) fat, corresponds with increased obesity . Reducing intake of saturated fat and refined carbohydrates facilitates weight loss and forms the basis of the most standard dietary approach . Incorporation of long-chain n-3 PUFA into a weight-loss program has been shown to improve risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease . An increase in dietary fiber may assist in weight control and reduce cardiometabolic risk by increasing satiety and therefore decreasing food intake and fat mass, improving glucose metabolism and the blood lipid profile, and reducing insulin resistance and blood pressure . A typical Western high-carbohydrate diet based on high-GI foods such as potatoes, breads and low-fat cereal products is digested and absorbed rapidly, resulting in a high GL and increased demand for insulin secretion . In contrast, low-GI foods such as whole grains and pulses benefit weight control by promoting satiety and fat oxidation at the expense of carbohydrate oxidation . Accordingly, when recommending a low-fat diet it is important to ensure that the carbohydrate consumed is appropriate, and that highly processed and low-fiber foods are avoided . Patients should understand that many foods promoted as 'low fat' are high in carbohydrate and low in fiber, and are therefore best avoided . Clinical studies of ad-libitum intake of an increased ratio of protein to carbohydrate have shown relatively greater loss of fat mass, relative preservation of fat-free mass, improved metabolic profile and better weight maintenance . It is important to emphasize that these diets are most effective when the carbohydrates consumed are unprocessed, nutrient-rich and of low energy density, and the source of fat is predominantly monounsaturated and omega-3-unsaturated rather than saturated fatty acids . The Ornish diet is based on plant-based foods that are low in fat and high in complex carbohydrates and fiber; less than 10% of the energy intake should be from fat . The term very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) refers to the use of a manufactured meal replacement that provides calories well below the average daily energy expenditure (450-600 kcal) while at the same time supplying all the essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and trace elements . VLCDs should form part of a comprehensive overall management program that includes behavioral management (see Chapter 7) and an ongoing lifestyle management program, as short-term approaches to reducing obesity are inevitably followed by regain of all of the weight lost . The use of VLCDs in patients with Pickwickian syndrome (respiratory and cardiac failure as a result of morbid obesity) achieves rapid and massive weight loss that may prove life-saving . Supplemental low-calorie diet or 'modified' VLCD approaches permit one small meal each day .","Weight loss requires a negative energy balance, which for most people is achieved more readily by caloric restriction than by increased physical activity. Dietary adherence is more important than the specific dietary pattern; choice of diet should therefore consider the particular patient's characteristics in terms of culture, lifestyle, understanding, sex, age etc. Important factors in promoting dietary adherence include convenience, choice and an ongoing behavioral support program. Healthy diets focus on fruit and vegetables, whole grains and lean unprocessed meat, chicken and seafood. Up to 30% of energy may come from fat but intake of saturated (animal) fat should be very limited. The predominant fats consumed should be of plant origin such as monounsaturated fatty acids (exempli gratia from olive oil) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and omega-3 fatty acids from seafood. Sugared beverages should be avoided; water is the ideal drink for hydration. Changing to a healthy diet has benefits for cardiometabolic health irrespective of weight loss. A reduction in bodyweight through caloric restriction will result in lower daily energy expenditure, and maintenance of weight loss will then depend on physical activity."
9781910797457,chp8,"In most cases, advanced prostate cancers treated with any form of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) eventually begin to progress, a phenomenon known as 'castrate resistance' . Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has been characterized as disease that has progressed despite the persistence of castrate levels of androgens (< 1.73 nmol/L or 50 ng/dL), but remains hormone sensitive and is amenable to further hormonal manipulation . In a randomized trial involving 1088 men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC who had not received previous chemotherapy, abiraterone plus prednisone improved radiographic progression-free survival and OS compared with prednisone alone; it also delayed PSA progression and increased the times to opiate use and initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (see Table 8.1) . Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor, approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC either prior to chemotherapy or after previous docetaxel treatment . In the PREVAIL trial in men with metastatic CRPC who had not had prior chemotherapy, oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, was associated with a 29% improvement in survival compared with placebo . A randomized trial (TAX-327) in men with CRPC found that a 3-week schedule of docetaxel was superior to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in terms of disease progression and OS (see Table 8.1) . It is approved for the treatment of CRPC in men with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease . The phase III ALSYMPCA study compared radium-223 with best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo with BSC in men with CRPC and bone metastases who had failed on or were unsuitable for docetaxel treatment . Treatment options when prostate cancer progresses after docetaxel chemotherapy include further chemotherapy, one of the new hormonal modulation agents or targeted alpha therapy . In the TROPIC study, men with CRPC that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomized to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone . In a study in men with metastatic CRPC for whom docetaxel chemotherapy had failed, abiraterone plus prednisone resulted in a 35% improvement in survival compared with prednisone alone (see Table 8.1) . In the AFFIRM trial, oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, improved survival in men with metastatic CRPC after failure of docetaxel chemotherapy (see Table 8.1) . In a phase III trial of men with CRPC not previously treated with docetaxel, treatment with sipuleucel-T resulted in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death compared with placebo, with minimal side effects (see Table 8.1) . Significant tumor responses with ipilimumab were seen in a phase II trial in men with metastatic CRPC . In a small randomized study of men with metastatic CRPC, those treated with PROSTVAC-VF had better OS than the placebo group (25.1 versus 16.6 months) . A study involving over 600 men with CRPC demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of patients with bone-related events among those receiving zoledronic acid (zoledronate), given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks, compared with placebo . Despite improving therapies, most patients with CRPC eventually die as a result of the cancer, often within 12-24 months .","After an initial response to androgen ablation, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value starts to rise as a result of androgen-insensitive cell clones. As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen. The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy. The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone is now also licensed for use before chemotherapy, and trials of other antiandrogens prior to chemotherapy are under way. When docetaxel chemotherapy has failed, second-line therapies such as cabazitaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone (a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis), enzalutamide (an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor) and radium-223 (targeted alpha therapy) have been shown to improve survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy for CRPC may be best implemented before significant symptoms appear. The monoclonal antibody denosumab and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have been reported to significantly delay bone-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer. External-beam radiotherapy may provide useful control of pain from bone metastases."
9781910797815,chp7,"Several treatments for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are currently in clinical development, including new Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and agents acting on different therapeutic targets (Table 7.1); combination regimens are also being explored . In the SIMPLIFY-1 trial in JAK2 inhibitor-naive patients with myelofibrosis, momelotinib produced comparable spleen responses to ruxolitinib but less control of symptoms . Fedratinib is a JAK2 inhibitor that provided significant improvements in symptom scores and spleen volume in trials involving patients with myelofibrosis . In the JAKARTA2 study involving with patients with myelofibrosis following failure of ruxolitinib, 46 of 83 assessable patients showed a spleen response . The JAK2/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is an indirect activator of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B)/mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway, inhibitors of which have been shown to dose-dependently inhibit the proliferation of cell lines with JAK2 V617F mutations, and to reduce clonogenic activity in hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with MPNs . Everolimus, which inhibits the mTOR kinase TORC1, has been shown to inhibit proliferation in JAK2 V617F-mutated cell lines when administered alone or in combination with JAK2 inhibitors, and produced a response rate of 23% in a Phase I/II study in patients with myelofibrosis . Panobinostat showed good efficacy and tolerability in a Phase I study in patients with myelofibrosis, and is currently being evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in Phase I/II trials . Although there is some evidence of better efficacy with this combination in terms of reduction in spleen volume, and some reversal of marrow fibrosis, patients experienced significant fatigue, anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity . In a Phase II study involving 22 patients with myelofibrosis, 36% showed some clinical benefit and 27% had a reduction in splenomegaly . Abnormalities in hedgehog pathway signaling have been described in animal models of myelofibrosis but most trials with inhibitors of this pathway in patients with MPN have not shown any benefit . However, some efficacy was seen with glasdegib in a recent Phase Ib/II trial involving 21 patients with myelofibrosis previously treated with JAK inhibitors: five patients had reductions in spleen volume and one showed improvement in anemia and became transfusion-independent . Other studies have suggested that treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor may enhance the efficacy of hypomethylating agents in patients with myelofibrosis or MPN blast phase . In a study with the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat, involving 33 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, complete or partial responses were achieved in 21% . Reductions in fibrosis, hemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements have been reported in a Phase II study in patients with myelofibrosis who received recombinant human pentraxin-2 (PRM-151) in combination with ruxolitinib . The safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with myelofibrosis and anemia are currently being investigated in a Phase II open-label study . Sotatercept has shown promising efficacy and tolerability in a Phase II dose-ranging study in patients with MDS, and it is currently being investigated in a Phase II open-label study in patients with MPN-related myelofibrosis and anemia . Another Bcl-2 inhibitor, navitoclax, is currently being evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in an open-label study in patients with myelofibrosis .","A variety of new therapies directed against diverse molecular targets are currently being evaluated. The Janus kinase 2 inhibitor pacritinib was superior to best available therapy in patients with myelofibrosis in terms of spleen and symptom responses. Other potential therapeutic targets include signaling pathways, histone deacetylase, telomerase, DNA methyltransferase and blockade of erythropoietin inhibitors. The use of ruxolitinib in combination with new therapies may offer a further potential approach to treatment."
9783318066685,ch4,"However, the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to transduce retinal cells on subretinal administration has enabled the development of therapies for such diseases . In Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2), mutations in the RPE65 gene prevent the expression of retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (RPE65), thereby impairing the process of visual photo-transduction and severely limiting vision . Initially, three independent clinical studies demonstrated that a single subretinal injection of AAV2 vector expressing the therapeutic RPE65 gene improved vision in treated regions of the retina . In these patients, mutations in the X-linked CHM gene (which encodes Rab escort protein 1 [REP-1]) cause slow and progressive degeneration of photoreceptors, choroid and retinal pigmented epithelium, typically leading to complete blindness by middle age . To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1 . Remarkably, all 15 babies treated by this gene therapy in the initial clinical trial are alive at age 20 months or older (these patients were expected to die within the first 2 years of life) . The FDA has approved the systemic AAV gene therapy for SMN1-deficient children up to the age of 2 years . At 2 years after gene transfer, these children continued to produce therapeutic levels of functional ARSA enzyme and showed normal motor and cognitive development without evidence of disease manifestation . Follow-up studies in a total of nine treated patients showed that the protocol indeed needs to be administered early during disease onset to obtain optimal results for motor and cognitive functions and prevention of CNS demyelination . Hence, gene therapies have been developed to correct autologous HSCs in children born with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), adenosine deaminase deficiency-severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome . Remarkably, gene therapy essentially resulted in a cure, with gene correction in multiple cell lineages, ADA expression at normal levels and restoration of immune competence . A large number of approaches, utilizing different gene transfer vectors and cell types for transgene expression, were initially explored during the 1990s . Initial experience with hepatic AAV- FIX gene transfer revealed the potential to activate CD8+ T-cell responses against the viral capsid, leading to hepatic injury and, in some cases, loss of transgene expression . Notably, patients treated in an earlier trial with an AAV vector expressing FIX without the Padua mutation reached levels above 5% of normal that were sustained for at least 8 years . An AAV5 vector expressing FVIII in patients with hemophilia A, when given at very high doses (up to 10 vector genomes/kg), was able to normalize coagulation levels . T cells are harvested from the patient's blood and transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) by ex vivo gene transfer using retroviral or lentiviral vectors (Figure 4.3) . The clinical study leading to approval demonstrated a complete remission rate of 60% and overall response rate of 81% in 75 patients receiving the anti-CD19 CAR-T cells .","Gene therapy, using gene-modified cells or in vivo gene transfer, has now been successful for diverse diseases and modes of gene transfer. After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for Leber congenital amaurosis and spinal muscular atrophy are now approved medicines in the USA and rely on in vivo injection to, respectively, the subretinal space and systemic circulation. Multiple gene therapies for hemophilia, based on hepatic AAV gene transfer, have elevated coagulation factor activities in patients to the normal or near normal range. These are now being evaluated in Phase III trials. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies for blood cancers, targeting the CD19 antigen, are in use to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adults."
9781908541680,ch_2,"Obesity is often considered to be a 'heart sink' condition: reluctance to address the issue may be due to time constraints, lack of training on obesity or in conducting sensitive conversations, anxiety about patient attitudes to raising a personal issue and/or concerns that the individual did not present asking for their global metabolic risk to be reduced . If a patient attending with an unrelated disorder is clearly obese (abdominal obesity is usually immediately recognizable), asking after their general health is a useful prologue to measurement of blood pressure, weight, height and blood lipid profile and opens the door for more extensive assessment and intervention at a later date . The examination should include measurement of height, weight and waist circumference (see Assessment of body fat) . Body fat analysis is optional but is useful for identifying patients with a normal body mass index (BMI) but high percentage of fat and for monitoring progress, in particular providing encouragement to patients who are improving their health by increased activity but who fail to lose weight . Body mass index, calculated as weight in kg divided by square of height in meters (kg/m), is in widespread use as a measure of adiposity (Table 1.3) . Highly trained athletes such as rugby players and American football players are often-cited examples of individuals with a high lean body mass that could be misidentified as obesity using BMI as a measure: their massive shoulders but slim waists often result in a BMI greater than 30 kg/m although they carry little fat . Thus, BMI is not the ideal measure for clinical practice, and is not suitable as a self-assessment tool . Waist circumference has gained recognition as a more accurate indicator of cardiometabolic risk than BMI, and is being increasingly embraced in routine medical practice . Waist circumference is also a useful and tangible marker of weight loss (or gain) for patients . An individual who has increased their physical activity and maintained their dietary intake will lose centimeters around the waist even though they may gain weight as muscle mass increases . Although BMI and waist circumference are widely used and easily accommodated within standard clinical practice, other measures of body fat, in particular bioimpedance analysis (BIA), are gaining prominence . This measure can be motivational in patients who become more active and improve their body composition without actually losing weight . It can be assessed using relatively inexpensive stand-on scales and is appropriate for use in obesity clinics, or by patients in their own homes . Waist circumference is a better predictor of risk of cardiometabolic disease (cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus) than BMI . Some studies have shown that, after adjustment for waist circumference, a higher BMI appears to protect against cardiometabolic disease, most likely because of a higher skeletal muscle mass, although the presence of relatively more subcutaneous than visceral fat may also be a factor . Other studies have demonstrated that BMI is a much less accurate indicator of risk than WHR or waist circumference, for instance in type 2 diabetes mellitus .","Whatever the reason for a patient's presentation, the presence of obesity should be acknowledged and tackled. The initial approach is crucial: an individual can be permanently engaged or alienated depending on the opening gambit. The best initial screening method is to look at the patient: an obese abdomen is a simple physical sign to pick up but can be indicative of potentially serious underlying disease. Waist circumference is directly proportional to the amount of visceral fat. It has gained recognition as a more accurate indicator of cardiometabolic risk than body mass index and is being increasingly embraced in routine medical practice. Decreased waist circumference in the absence of weight loss can keep a patient motivated."
