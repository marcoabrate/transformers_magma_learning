Overall, treatment options vary according to the stage of the tumor (see Chapter 3) but also depend on the individual patient's lung function, volume of disease and performance status . To be eligible for radical radiotherapy, patients must have adequate lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV ] >= 1 liter or >= 40% predicted; transfer factor >= 40%), good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score 0-1) and disease that can be encompassed in a radiotherapy treatment volume without undue risk of damaging normal tissue . All patients eligible for radiotherapy should first undergo a planning CT scan in the treatment position . Conventionally, fractionated radiotherapy is administered, usually with a daily dose of approximately 2 Gy . Hyperfractionation is radiotherapy delivered at less than 2 Gy per fraction but more than once a day so that the treatment time remains the same but total dose is increased . Hypofractionated radiotherapy refers to dose fractions greater than 2 Gy and allows acceleration of treatment . continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART): 54 Gy in 36 fractions over 12 consecutive days . Reports from cohorts who received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy indicate dismal 5-year survivals of 32% for stage I and 21% for stage II patients . Compared with conventional fractionation at a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions, it has demonstrated superior local control (23% vs 16%) and 5-year overall survival (30% vs 21%) . It has been estimated that a dose greater than 84 Gy is needed to provide 50% tumor control at 3 years . A meta-analysis in stage I patients has confirmed equivalent survival to surgery at 2 years . Local failures occur in less than 10% of patients but these failure rates can increase as tumor volume increases, with T2 disease or as the dose falls . The best outcomes are seen when conventional radical radiotherapy is used concurrently with chemotherapy; in a meta-analysis of 1764 patients with stage IIIA and IIIB disease, the absolute benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over radical radiotherapy alone was 4% and 2.2% at 2 years and 5 years, respectively, with increased risk of grade 3/4 esophagitis . The CHART regimen of hyperfractionated accelerated treatment has shown a survival benefit over standard radical radiotherapy delivery . The SOCCAR trial (55 Gy in 20 fractions) demonstrated that hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy can be given safely with concurrent chemotherapy . This hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen, widely used in the UK, will form the basis of the control arm in the upcoming UK ADSCAN trial, which will assess dose intensification in sequential chemoradiation . Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) has a role in reducing the risk of recurrence in patients who are found to have a positive margin on histopathology, id est residual microscopic disease (an R1 resection), but not after R0 resections . A meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials over 30 years found a 7% decrease in survival (48% vs 55%, p <0.001) when PORT was administered .
In other words, the addict's whole motivational system is subverted by the drug creating powerful urges, desires or needs to engage in the drug-taking behavior despite the actual or potential harm being caused . Repeated intake of nicotine from cigarettes over a period of months or years changes the way that the pathway described above operates, so that if nicotine concentrations in the brain fall below a certain level, the activity in the pathway falls to abnormally low levels; this creates a kind of 'acquired drive', a hunger for nicotine, that is often experienced as craving . Unfortunately, such discomfort can occur for all kinds of reasons, and the smoker's brain is not good at discriminating adverse mood states that arise from nicotine withdrawal from those arising from other causes . Unfortunately, as long as they believe that smoking helps to relieve adverse mood and other symptoms, smokers will be at risk of relapse when they try to stop . Putting all this together, we can see that there are probably at least three ways in which repeated ultra-rapid intake of nicotine from cigarettes creates powerful motivations to smoke, which undermine and overwhelm the resolve not to . For some smokers the nicotine withdrawal syndrome is relatively mild, while others experience severe adverse mood states when not smoking . If a patient has tried to stop smoking and failed because the urge to smoke is too strong, the need for a cigarette is overwhelming, or the withdrawal symptoms are too much to bear, that patient is addicted to cigarettes . Unfortunately, research shows that these fail even the most basic test of a measure of addiction to cigarettes - predicting relapse in people who try to stop smoking - so it is not recommended to use them . Given the strength of the physiological and behavioral forces driving continued smoking, it should not be surprising that quitting is difficult and the chances of success of any one attempt are low . Smokers who have just failed in an attempt to quit may need a period of a few months or so to 'rest' and recover from that effort . Those who fail are highly likely still to be motivated to have another attempt, and some try to quit several times a year . About half of all quit attempts are made without any pre-planning at all - the smoker does not even finish the pack of cigarettes he or she is smoking . Most of the time this discomfort is not sufficient to trigger a quit attempt because it is mitigated by the perception that quitting can be done at a later date, and it is countered by not wanting to give up the perceived benefits of smoking, together with anticipation of the difficulties and unpleasant consequences of trying to stop . If the would-be ex-smoker does smoke a cigarette in response to the immediate urge or need to smoke, usually he or she does not immediately abandon the quit attempt . Even after the quit attempt is abandoned, it can take weeks or even months before the previous pattern of smoking is re-established, and the smoker usually retains an interest in stopping at a future time point .
The main pathological feature of Parkinson's disease is the degeneration of neuromelanin-containing neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (Figure 2.1) . There is now growing evidence for an upper gastrointestinal origin of Lewy body pathology; animal model studies have shown that such a process can spread via the vagal route to the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, which corresponds to Braak stages 1 and 2 . As Braak's six-stage theory and other clinical studies indicate, Parkinson's disease is a very complex disorder and the motor manifestations required to make a diagnosis are just the tip of the iceberg . Pathological studies have shown reduced glutathione levels in patients who died from Parkinson's disease, suggesting excessive utilization of glutathione by free radicals . In several contemporary postmortem case reports, the brain tissues of patients with Parkinson's disease who had received embryonic cell transplants were shown to have developed Lewy body inclusions in previously healthy transplant cells . There may be a very long presymptomatic period, spanning two or three decades (Hawkes suggests a presymptomatic period of at least 20 years); it is even possible that a static insult at some point in a person's life may predispose them to develop Parkinson's disease because of the attrition of dopamine-bearing neurons with age . Individuals with a family history of Parkinson's disease, and those with RBD and impaired olfaction (late-onset hyposmia), may have a higher risk of developing the disease . In a 2-year study, 10% of these high-risk individuals showed deterioration in dopaminergic markers, and some developed clinical disease . It is now widely believed that the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease are not only due to the loss of a single monoamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, but also the effects of widespread Lewy body disease . Non-motor symptoms that become evident in the prodromal phase of the disease, such as late-onset hyposmia, RBD, constipation and depression, are all risk factors for Parkinson's disease . One case of an Ile1371Val substitution in LRRK2 has been reported, with the typical Lewy body pathology that stained positive for ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein and symptoms identical to idiopathic sporadic Parkinson's disease . In the genome-wide scan for Parkinson's disease (GenePD) study, which investigated the effect of heterozygous PARK2 mutations on age of onset in patients with familial Parkinson's disease, one member from each of 183 families was screened for PARK2 mutations: 12.6% of the families were positive . Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, but estimating its incidence and prevalence is problematic as there is no 'in-life' marker for idiopathic Parkinson's disease; the diagnosis can only be made with certainty if Lewy bodies (intracytoplasmic aggregations of misfolded protein in the brain) are found in the substantia nigra and other brain regions after death (see pages 19 -) . Studies have suggested that relative survival for people with Parkinson's disease diagnosed before the age of 60 is similar to that for the general population, but for those who are older at diagnosis relative survival is less than expected .
At the normal neuromuscular junction (NMJ), acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the motor neuron terminal, diffuses across the synaptic space and binds to ACh receptors (AChR), which are densely clustered on the folded endplate membrane of the muscle fiber . A series of animal and human experiments in the 1970s confirmed the above hypothesis, and elevated titers of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were ultimately discovered in the serum of patients with MG . Loss of AChRs results in impaired neuromuscular transmission and muscle weakness . Both the immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody and complement have been localized to the motor endplate in myasthenia models, indicating that circulating IgG antibodies directed against the AChR bind to the postsynaptic membrane and activate the terminal complement sequence (C5b-9), or membrane attack complex (MAC) . This results in lysis of the postsynaptic membrane, causing loss of the AChR (Figure 2.2) . 'Binding' antibodies are the most common type found in patients with MG . A key mechanism of disease pathology in MG is the modulation, internalization and eventual destruction of AChRs at the NMJ by the crosslinking of AChR-specific autoantibodies (Figure 2.3) . 'Blocking' antibodies are the second most common type found in patients with MG . These antibodies block the binding of ACh to AChRs on the muscle endplate (Figure 2.4) . As a result of the pathological processes described above, the postsynaptic membrane becomes simplified, with a reduction in the number of AChRs and junctional folds and a reduced safety factor in neuromuscular transmission, ultimately leading to impaired neuromuscular transmission . Although most patients with generalized MG have antibodies to AChR (see below), a minority of patients without AChR antibodies have antibodies to the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) . The disease can be particularly severe in patients with MuSK antibodies (see below) . In animal models, administration of MuSK antibodies has resulted in reduced postsynaptic AChRs, disturbed synaptic alignment, reduced synaptic potentials and impaired muscle activation . Ocular MG, which causes only ptosis and/or diplopia, occurs in approximately 15% of cases; generalized disease occurs in the remainder . Antibodies to AChR may be of the binding, blocking or modulating type, with binding being the most common . AChR antibodies are highly specific for the diagnosis of MG, although the degree of elevation in titers has never been found to correlate with the severity of disease . Antibodies to muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) occur in about 7% of cases of generalized MG but are rarely reported in isolated ocular disease . Ocular and limb muscle weakness is less common than in AChR-antibody-related disease but is certainly seen in this population . When AChR or MuSK antibodies are not detected, patients are diagnosed with MG by clinical or electrodiagnostic means (typically with repetitive nerve stimulation or single fiber electromyography; see page 25 -) and are classified as 'double seronegative' or 'seronegative' . Included in this group are a small percentage of patients with antibodies only to 'clustered' AChRs . Osserman was the first to classify patients with MG according to disease severity .
A further characteristic feature of high-grade gliomas is the presence of necrotic tumor cells of varying form and shape . When assessing gliomas, it must be borne in mind that some tumors with the molecular profile of a glioblastoma (see below) may not have all high-grade features . It is increasingly apparent that diffuse infiltrating gliomas may not have high-grade features when diagnosed early . Following the initial histological assessment, a set of markers is used to identify molecular subgroups of high-grade gliomas (see Table 1.1) or, indeed, to refine the diagnosis where both low- and high-grade histology is present . This chapter focuses on the diagnostic use of imaging in patients with suspected glioma/glioblastoma . Of note, calcification on CT in an untreated tumor is rare in primary (IDH wild-type) glioblastoma and should prompt consideration of an alternative diagnosis (exempli gratia oligodendroglioma) . T2-weighted and FLAIR images are most valuable for estimating macroscopic tumor boundaries: FLAIR increases the overall contrast between the tumor and normal brain tissue, and may thus facilitate lesion detection, while the loss of grey-white matter detail, indicative of tumor, is well delineated on T2 images . Compared to IDH -mutant lower-grade gliomas, early (IDH wild-type) glioblastomas are variably smaller tumors that may manifest only as subtle signal abnormalities on T2/FLAIR imaging . For example, the Visually Accessible Rembrandt (VASARI) criteria use a set of well-defined visual features (exempli gratia enhancement, necrosis, peritumoral edema) to provide an objective description of gliomas . Anatomic MRI is essential for the diagnosis of glioblastoma, but it has limited sensitivity and specificity for the characterization of morphologically atypical lesions; for example, CNS lymphoma with central necrosis or with solitary metastases . However, to improve the identification of malignant gliomas, recent European guidance recommends the addition of perfusion imaging for newly diagnosed non-gadolinium-enhancing masses . Perfusion MRI aims to identify neovascularization in brain tumors by analyzing (contrast-enhanced) blood flow through a volume of tissue over time . Blood volume is typically raised in aggressive IDH wild-type gliomas, but small (exempli gratia early) glioblastomas can elicit false-negative perfusion results . DWI uses a minimum of two diffusion gradients (usually b0 and b1000 mm /s) in three orthogonal directions and is widely integrated into clinical MRI protocols, including brain tumor imaging . This feature can occur in glioblastoma, but malignant gliomas are more likely to exhibit diffusion values similar to or slightly greater than normal brain tissue . To a limited extent, ADC measurements may also be valuable for differential diagnosis; for example, primary central nervous system lymphoma typically has lower ADC values than glioblastoma, but results can overlap for individual tumors . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive modality that measures metabolites (including choline, N -acetyl aspartate, lactate, lipids) in a defined volume of brain tissue . In general, the presence of lactate indicates a 'high grade' neoplasm, but as a single measurement it is not entirely specific and may occasionally be observed in IDH -mutant low-grade astrocytomas and non-neoplastic conditions . MRS has limited accuracy for glioma grading and is preferentially used to distinguish tumors from non-neoplastic conditions .
The term pancreatic cancer usually refers to common pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, although there is a large variety of other exocrine solid tumor types (Table 11.1) with varying prognoses . Other tumors that arise in the pancreas, or in close proximity to it, are part of the differential diagnosis in a patient with suspected pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal and back pain can also be suggestive of pancreatic head cancer, although they are more frequently encountered in body and tail tumors . Serum cancer antigen (CA) 19.9 is a useful tumor marker, but not all pancreatic adenocarcinomas have elevated CA 19.9 . Cancers in the head of the pancreas will cause dilation of both the main bile duct and the main pancreatic duct (97%), giving rise to the classic 'double-duct' radiological sign (visualized by transabdominal ultrasound, CT or MRI) . Transabdominal ultrasound can be used to identify a dilated extrahepatic main bile duct as well as perhaps the primary pancreatic tumor (Figure 11.1) and large liver metastases, if present . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is important for the diagnosis of ampullary and duodenal tumors as there is direct visualization of the major papilla, allowing the possibility of direct biopsy; brush cytology of the bile and pancreatic ducts may also be undertaken . Nevertheless, ERCP should no longer be used as a pure diagnostic technique (because of the risk of pancreatitis), and is mostly used for the preoperative drainage of the common bile duct in jaundiced patients . However, PET in combination with CT or MRI may play an important role in the future for the staging of pancreatic cancer and patient stratification . Preoperative tissue diagnosis may not always be needed in a resectable pancreatic mass if the symptoms, signs, laboratory data and imaging are classic for pancreatic cancer in an otherwise surgically fit patient . However, when a preoperative tissue diagnosis is required in a potentially resectable pancreatic mass, EUS-guided FNA should be the preferred route on account of the lower potential risk of peritoneal seeding, the shorter needle tract and the inclusion of the needle track in the resection specimen (in pancreatic head tumors) . Tissue diagnosis may be needed in borderline resectable pancreatic tumors if the patient is to undergo preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy before surgery . Emerging data show that EUS and MRI may be used for secondary screening of high-risk groups, such as those at risk of familial pancreatic cancer . Recent studies have suggested that EUS and MRI are the preferred tests for screening high-risk groups as they detect more lesions than CT and with no radiation involved . Current treatment options for patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer include either FOLFIRINOX (a combination regimen consisting of folinic acid [leucovorin], fluorouracil [5-FU], irinotecan and oxaliplatin), gemcitabine, or gemcitabine and albumin-bound nab-paclitaxel . Some centers have pioneered and established the approach of preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery in borderline resectable patients to improve survival . Adjuvant treatment following pancreatic resection is frequently used and consists of chemotherapy with or without the use of radiation .
Because of past harms associated with research involving human participants, there is an expectation and, in many cases, a regulatory requirement that an ethics committee review will take place in advance of the research commencing . This membership convention has been adopted globally for organizations conducting FDA-regulated research under the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice guidelines . The IRB is responsible for reviewing research that involves human participants to evaluate compliance with federal regulations and application of ethical principles . Federal regulations and accepted ethical principles are in place to guide the conduct of research so that the science is rigorous and the participants are protected . The IRB review and approval are usually needed if the activity is considered to be research and the people involved with testing meet the definition of a human subject (exempli gratia clinical or non-clinical research) . For example, if the research involves collection of biosamples, non-invasive clinical testing (exempli gratia sensory acuity, moderate exercise by healthy volunteers) or examination of existing data like electronic health records (EHRs), it may be eligible for an expedited review . The only difference between an expedited and convened committee review is the number of people involved in evaluating the research plan . Any study that does not qualify for exempt or expedited review is evaluated by a convened group of IRB members . Once the type of review is known, an IRB application is developed by the research team that includes a detailed research protocol and a draft of the informed consent document . The IRB will review this protocol application to evaluate whether the risks are appropriate in relation to the potential contribution to science and benefits to people like those who participate in the study . While IRB approval is an important step in the process for identifying and mitigating risk in studies, it is truly the responsibility of developers, researchers and clinicians to be a part of the ethical decision-making process . Others addressing digital medicine technologies more specifically include the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative, MobileELSI research project, Sage Bionetworks and the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), which are described in the following paragraphs . Launched in 2015 at the University of California, San Diego, USA, the CORE initiative is a learning 'ethics' resource developed to support the digital medicine research community, including researchers and IRBs . The checklist prompts researchers to think about ethics, privacy, risks and benefits, access and usability, and data management (see) (Figure 5.2) . Neither are obligated to apply the federal regulations to protect research participants unless, of course, they are developing an FDA-covered product or are conducting federally funded research . When research involves retrospective analysis of existing data or prospective observation, testing or experimenting with people to generate 'generalizable' knowledge, an IRB review is needed . Some instances of A/B testing may be considered human subject research, depending on whether an organization intends to share knowledge broadly or use it internally to improve its product or service .
The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is maximum surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide and adjuvant temozolomide . The standard of care described above is based on the results of the 2005 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 26981-22981/National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) Clinical Trials Group CE3 randomized Phase III trial of radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide versus radiotherapy alone in 573 patients with glioblastoma . The survival benefit in patients who received adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy continued to the 5-year follow-up, including in patients aged 60-70 years . A pooled analysis of individual patient data from four randomized trials involving patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide has been reported . After adjusting for prognostic factors (age, performance status, extent of resection and MGMT methylation), treatment with more than six cycles of temozolomide was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.80 [95% CI 0.65-0.98]; p > 0.03), particularly in patients with methylated MGMT (n > 342; HR 0.65 [0.50-0.85]; p < 0.01) . Dose intensification of adjuvant temozolomide has not been shown to prolong OS in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, and survival has not been improved by the addition of cilengitide, the peptide vaccine rindopepimut or bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A (see page 53) . A recent randomized Phase III trial investigated the addition of the alkylating nitrosourea lomustine to temozolomide plus radiotherapy in 129 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylation of the MGMT promoter . In 2019, Hegi and colleagues reported a study that examined the optimal cut-off for definition of MGMT methylation based on four randomized trials involving 1725 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who received standard radiotherapy and temozolomide . Other prognostic factors associated with improved survival in patients with glioblastoma receiving radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide are younger age, better performance status, Mini-Mental State Examination score of 27 or higher and no steroid treatment at baseline . A recent trial found that the addition of bevacizumab to lomustine in patients with progressive glioblastoma after chemoradiotherapy did not improve survival: median OS was 9.1 months (95% CI 8.1-10.1) with the combination treatment compared with 8.6 months (7.6-10.4) with lomustine monotherapy . The pivotal EORTC-NCIC study that demonstrated the survival benefit of adding concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma only recruited patients aged 70 years and younger . A recent trial in older patients (>= 65 years; n > 562) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma compared radiotherapy (40 Gy in 15 fractions) alone and with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (75 mg/m daily for 21 days, followed by 150-200 mg/m on days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle for up to 12 cycles or until disease progression) . The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy increased median OS from 7.6 to 9.3 months (HR for death 0.67 [95% CI 0.56-0.8]; p < 0.001), without compromising quality of life and with manageable chemotherapy-related side effects .
Current therapy of osteoarthritis (OA) largely aims to treat existing disease by controlling its major symptom - pain - and maintain or improve joint and limb function and improve quality of life . While there are numerous therapies targeted against symptoms, at present no treatments have been definitively shown to modify the structural progression of OA . A healthy diet is important to aid weight control, but no diets or dietary supplements have been shown to prevent, or to modify the progression of, OA . There are many evidence-based guidelines from a variety of specialty societies for managing OA (see Key references, page 72) . People with OA should be involved in their own management, and should receive education about their condition and the range and safety of treatment options available . Optimum treatment involves a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches . Therapies, particularly pharmacological ones, need to be tailored according to an individual person's comorbidities and risk factors . Exercise and weight management should be recommended to all patients . Table 6.1 summarizes the hierarchy of options that should be considered for managing individuals with OA . Remember, none of these therapies is mutually exclusive and patients who are not responding should be offered as many options as possible before surgery is considered . Therapies will need to be tailored according to an individual patient's comorbidities and preferences . There is little research on what patients actually do, but certainly compliance, perhaps more so with self-directed therapies, such as exercise, is often low . Clinicians therefore need to adapt the consultation to the needs of the individual patient to reach agreement on a suitable and sustainable management plan . The subsequent chapters give an overview of the rationale, evidence and clinical hints for using a particular therapy . Studies use different definitions of OA, focusing on symptoms, clinical features, radiographic findings, or a combination of these . Inclusion of a wide range of pain severity (and presumably a wide range of structural pathology) means that the effects of a therapy on subgroups may be missed . The Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Core Set (OMERACT) for OA recommends collecting data on pain, function and quality of life; however, there are many instruments for measuring these domains, and they have different performance metrics . For example, modern studies use patient-reported generic pain visual analog or numeric rating scales, or the more responsive disease-specific multi-domain instruments such as the Western Ontario MacMaster questionnaire (commonly known as WOMAC) . Most trials (of drugs in particular) tend to include relatively healthy patients and do not reflect the usual older OA population with a high frequency of comorbidities . Many studies have reported a statistically significant difference between two trial therapies without reporting whether the result is important clinically . This may sometimes be expressed as the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) . The MCID may vary depending on the measure used to estimate a patient's symptoms . Although the reader should look at specific data for individual outcome measures, in general, a treatment effect of at least 20% is desirable .
Most myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are chronic conditions that remain clinically stable for many years; however, the condition may progress to acute leukemia in a minority of patients, referred to as MPN blast phase (MPN-BP) . Typically, patients with ET or PV initially develop post-ET or post-PV myelofibrosis, which may subsequently undergo transformation to MPN-BP, although in rare cases these conditions may transform directly into MPN-BP without an intermediate myelofibrotic stage . Risk factors for the development of MPN-BP include leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and unfavorable karyotype (Table 9.1) . The principal criterion is the same as for de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML): more than 20% blasts in bone marrow or peripheral blood . Persistence is also important if only peripheral blood blasts are considered . Importantly, acceleration or progression of myelofibrosis is usually apparent before the development of overt leukemia . worsening cytopenia or anemia . worsening of constitutional symptoms . increasing numbers of blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood . In addition, recent evidence suggests that progression during treatment with Janus kinase inhibitors is associated with a risk of MPN-BP . MPN-BP is associated with a poor prognosis: median survival is 2-6 months, although this may be prolonged by intensive treatment and prompt recourse to stem cell transplantation (SCT) . There is no standard of care for MPN-BP, and many of the current treatment regimens (Table 9.2) are derived from experience in AML . Induction chemotherapy and SCT . In general, MPN-BP should only be treated with induction chemotherapy when allogeneic SCT is planned in eligible patients . The induction chemotherapy regimens are the same as those used in AML, and response rates are similar to those seen in poor-risk AML patients: typically, complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi) rates are 40-50%, although rates of approximately 70% have been reported with a combination of cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline . Eligible patients should therefore undergo SCT as soon as possible . The importance of this is highlighted by a study in which median overall survival in patients who completed allogeneic SCT following CR/CRi with induction chemotherapy was 47 months, compared with 9.4 months in those who achieved a CR/CRi but did not go on to SCT . In one study, 8 of 13 patients proceeded to SCT after induction chemotherapy and were followed for a median of 20 months . All five who achieved CR had returned to chronic MPN at the time of SCT but remained in remission, whereas 2 of 3 patients with persistent marrow or circulating blasts died . Patients with MPN-BP who are not eligible for induction chemotherapy or SCT may benefit from treatment with hypomethylating agents . In one study involving 54 patients with MPN-BP or a condition suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome, treatment with azacitidine resulted in an overall response rate (CR + CRi + partial response) of 28% after a median of 20 months' follow-up, and median overall survival was 8 months in the MPN-BP group .
Androgen deprivation, which has become the mainstay of treatment, effectively reduces the intratumoral dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentration by 70-80%, reducing stimulation of androgen receptors and increasing apoptosis of prostate cancer cells (Table 7.1) . Androgen deprivation can be achieved by orchidectomy (surgical removal of the testes) or treatment with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogs/antagonists; the value of adding an antiandrogen (maximal androgen blockade; see page 90) is still debated . The LHRH antagonist degarelix has shown positive clinical results in controlled clinical studies involving men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (Figure 7.3) . An additional potential benefit could be in men receiving intermittent hormonal therapy, in whom the rapid return to normal LHRH receptor function following withdrawal of the drug results in an accompanying rapid return of testosterone . The non-steroidal antiandrogens inhibit the androgen receptor only and should not be taken as monotherapy for metastatic disease as the results are inferior to those achieved with LHRH analogs . Several trials have shown that maximal androgen blockade using an LHRH analog in combination with an antiandrogen improves survival compared with either LHRH analog treatment alone or orchidectomy . in 2006 found that delayed hormonal treatment in men with pelvic lymph node metastases was associated with a sevenfold increase in deaths from prostate cancer compared with those who had immediate androgen ablation therapy . A study that explored the timing of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men who experienced a rising PSA after primary treatment of prostate cancer reported a 45% decrease in OS in those who delayed therapy (by >= 2 years) compared with those who had immediate treatment . It is clear that early initiation of hormone therapy in men with locally advanced or metastatic disease improves survival and decreases complications . It has been suggested that continuous androgen ablation therapy may, in fact, increase the rate of progression of prostate cancer to a castrate-resistant state (see Chapter 8), prompting the exploration of the use of intermittent hormonal therapy, which also has the potential advantage of decreasing the side effects of therapy . The use of a pure LHRH antagonist, which blocks the receptor without initial stimulation (see page 89), could be advantageous in this setting given the absence of flare and, potentially, a more rapid restoration of testosterone level after cessation of therapy . Two randomized trials have compared intermittent versus continuous treatment in men with advanced prostate cancer . In the CHAARTED study, 790 men with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer were randomized to ADT, either alone or in combination with six cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy . In the STAMPEDE study, a significant difference in OS was reported in men with advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer who received ADT in combination with docetaxel chemotherapy compared with those who received androgen deprivation alone . In a subgroup analysis of men with metastatic prostate cancer, OS was improved by 27% with combination therapy . There is now good evidence that, at least in men with high-volume hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, giving early docetaxel chemotherapy in addition to androgen deprivation therapy improves survival .
Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea . Pharmacological management . Conventional antiemetics are more successful at preventing emesis than nausea . Current data from multiple large studies suggest that neither first- nor second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT) receptor antagonists (RAs) are effective in the control of nausea in patients receiving either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC or HEC, respectively), despite marked improvement in the control of emesis . Multiple large phase III trials have also shown that although the neurokinin (NK)-1 RA aprepitant is effective for the control of emesis, it is not effective in controling nausea in patients receiving MEC or HEC . Similarly, phase III clinical trial data indicate that the new neurokinin (NK)-1 RAs netupitant and rolapitant are not effective antinausea agents,, although rolapitant may have some effect in patients receiving cisplatin HEC . These studies suggest that the serotonin (5-HT) and substance P (NK-1) receptors may not be important in the mediation of nausea, despite their important role in chemotherapy-induced emesis (see page 11) . New studies using novel agents and using nausea as the primary endpoint need to be performed . Olanzapine appears to have high potential for the control of both emesis and nausea in patients receiving MEC or HEC (Table 6.1) . Phase III studies suggest that olanzapine may be an important agent in the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea . Olanzapine is known to affect a wide variety of receptors including dopamine D, 5-HT 2C, histaminic and muscarinic receptors . At present, there is still a substantial lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced nausea, and any or all of these receptors may be important mediators . The addition of olanzapine to the 5-HT RA azasetron and dexamethasone has been shown to improve nausea and emesis compared with azasetron and dexamethasone alone in patients receiving MEC and HEC . Olanzapine, palonosetron and dexamethasone has been shown to improve the control of nausea compared with aprepitant, palonosetron and dexamethasone in patients receiving HEC . Breakthrough nausea and emesis was controlled with olanzapine in patients receiving HEC and guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics . The addition of olanzapine to aprepitant, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone significantly improved nausea and emesis compared with aprepitant, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone alone in patients receiving HEC . Olanzapine is available as a generic . Other agents . Preliminary small studies with gabapentin have demonstrated some effectiveness in the control of chemotherapy-induced emesis, but the control of nausea has yet to be determined . More studies with the use of cannabinoids need to be performed before it is known whether this class of agent is clinically efficacious in the control of CINV . The studies performed to date do not support the use of ginger as an effective agent in the prevention of CINV . Non-pharmacological management . Few randomized clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of non-pharmacological measures to prevent or treat chemotherapy-induced nausea . Table 6.2 summarizes measures suggested by case reports .
In some patients, particularly those with skin of color and Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI, hyper- (Figure 3.7) or hypopigmented macules may persist following resolution of inflammatory acne lesions . Acne conglobata is a very severe form of inflammatory acne characterized by grouped comedones, cysts, abscesses, draining sinus tracts and scars (Figure 3.8) . Patients with this very severe form of acne require expert care with oral isotretinoin, oral and intralesional corticosteroids and surgical excision of sinus tracts . Acne fulminans is a very severe form of inflammatory acne associated with systemic signs and symptoms, including fever, arthralgias and/or osteolytic lesions of the clavicles or ribs . In some cases, this form of acne is characterized by tender inflammatory papules or nodules involving the lower third of the face and neck (Figure 3.10) . Acute onset, persistent or severe acne in the presence of virilization in children aged 1-7 years should always raise the possibility of an underlying endocrinopathy including premature adrenarche, precocious puberty, congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11beta-hydroxylase deficiency or the presence of an adrenocortical tumor . In prepubertal acne, predictive factors for severity and persistence include a high number of comedones, mid-facial distribution and early development of comedones, high to normal levels of DHEAS and high total testosterone . Coal tar derivatives and insoluble cutting oils can produce an inflammatory acne characterized by large comedones, papules, pustules, cysts and nodules . Outbreaks of severe inflammatory lesions, which heal with scarring, can occur for years following exposure to the offending agent . The differential diagnosis of acne includes drug-induced acneiform eruptions, rosacea, pyoderma faciale, gram-negative folliculitis and perioral dermatitis . A number of drugs cause or worsen acne or can induce an acneiform eruption (Table 3.5) . A diagnosis of acne vulgaris is defined by the presence of closed comedones, papules and pustules . In contrast, most drug-induced 'acnes' represent acne-like eruptions embracing monomorphic inflammatory lesions in the absence of comedones, often presenting abruptly outside the most frequent age range for acne and extending over areas not commonly affected by acne . Papules, pustules and nodules occur and severe forms such as acne conglobata have been described . If 'acne' is triggered the drug should be withdrawn; response is variable and systemic therapy and physical treatment of the comedones may be required . Steroid acne is usually, but not invariably, more monomorphic than true acne vulgaris; however, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions may be present on the face, back and chest (Figure 3.12) . A drug-induced skin reaction occurs in more than 50% of patients, often within a few weeks of receiving therapy . The changes include follicular papules and sterile pustules on the face and upper trunk in a distribution similar to conventional acne, although in severe cases the limbs may be affected . Gram-negative folliculitis is characterized by the sudden development of superficial pustules in patients who have been treated for acne with antibiotics (Figure 3.16) . Acne can be classified as comedonal, mild, moderate or severe based on the type of lesions (Table 3.6) .
Problems occur in muscles, intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments or spinal nerves . The erector spinae muscles originate on the lower ribs and thoracic transverse processes and insert on the lumbar vertebrae, the iliac crests and adjacent to the posterior superior iliac spines . This can be a consequence of pain referral from vertebral facet or discal strains at either the dorsolumbar origins or the iliolumbar insertions of the erector spinae muscles . Piriformis syndrome consists of symptoms of sciatic radiculopathy associated with tenderness in the piriformis muscle region on deep palpation, and the absence of MRI or electrodiagnostic evidence of a disc protrusion . Because tenderness in the sciatic outlet/piriformis region is the most common pain referral manifestation of a lumbar strain with or without any nerve root impingement, the diagnosis of a piriformis syndrome is too often made . The posterior longitudinal ligamentous constraints are weaker posterolaterally, and so most disc protrusions occur away from the midline and may impact the laterally placed nerve roots . Pronounced discal slippage may contribute to adjacent nerve root impingement, adding to the spinal canal narrowing already resulting from vertebral overlap, and thereby contributing, along with accompanying facet and degenerative spondylosis, to the potential development of spinal stenosis and to recurrent and chronic low back pain syndromes . The most common type of spondylolisthesis is anterolisthesis, with the superior vertebra anteriorly overriding the one below, but retrolisthesis and lateral listhesis are also seen, usually as a consequence of intradiscal and secondary facet degenerative pathology in the upper (L2-L3) lumbar vertebrae . Facet joint malalignments and associated degenerative osteoarthritic changes (Figure 3.6) are commonly noted radiographically with or without, and before and after, any accompanying low back pain disorders . The sacroiliac joint (see Figure 3.1) was once thought to be the major factor in low back pain and sciatica, but discovery of the role of disc protrusions has dramatically changed that perception . Evidence supporting the pain referral patterns of lumbar discs and facet joints to the sacroiliac region is irrefutable, but this is not evidence of a causative role for the sacroiliac joint in a low back pain syndrome . Sacralization/lumbaralization of the lumbosacral vertebrae, and/or various degrees of fusion of transverse processes, are not per se typically associated with low back pain, though they may contribute to restricted lumbar movement and secondary strain . The precise basis for the development of trochanteric bursitis is not always apparent, though it appears to be related to reflex-induced tension of the muscles that pass over the bursa due to referred lumbar disc-related pain, or to torsional strain as a consequence of gait alterations in the case of hip and/or knee joint disorders, or leg length asymmetry . Most radiculopathies, and particularly those associated with low back pain and sciatica, are the result of disc-related nerve root compressions (Figure 3.7) . Compression in association with inflammation and congestion of the nerve roots and/or ganglia, as well as adjacent ligamentous and articular tissues, however, does cause release of substance P and other pain-stimulating cytokines . Sensory dysfunctions resulting from disc-nerve-root disorders usually manifest in a fairly specific dermatomal pattern .
Although levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the initial benefit begins to diminish over time with dyskinesias and fluctuations in motor response (Figure 7.1) . Table 7.1 shows the clinically most important indicators, both motor and non-motor, for defining advanced Parkinson's disease, and the functional impact those symptoms are likely to have on the patient . In advanced disease, the improvement in parkinsonism correlates with the level of levodopa in the bloodstream (Table 7.3) . 'Dose failures' may be related to poor absorption of levodopa or due to the recently described phenomenon of 'internalization' of dopamine receptors, so that drugs become ineffective for a period . Dyskinesias are hyperkinetic states mostly seen in patients with levodopa-treated Parkinson's disease . In the early stage of the disease, these states are often not noticed by patients and are a good sign of dopa responsiveness . A large body of research in animal models suggests that dyskinesias arise from alteration of dopaminergic tone in the denervated striatum, together with delivery of treatment by non-physiological pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors . Reducing dopaminergic drugs will diminish dyskinesia, but may lead to a return of Parkinson's disease symptoms . Smaller doses of dopa given more frequently, or a combination of the drug with a dopamine agonist, may help, but problems are likely to reappear (see Table 7.4) . Dementia is an important cause of comorbidity in parkinsonism; when cognition declines, mortality increases . Global intellectual decline (dementia) is usually a feature of parkinsonism in the elderly, with more than 30% of patients over 70 years affected . Excessive dopaminergic therapy or anticholinergic drugs can cause hallucinosis in the early stages of disease, but later hallucinosis may occur without drugs and is difficult to control . Dementia associated with Parkinson's disease has been termed subcortical, indicating predominant memory disorders, bradyphrenia and disorientation . Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra lead to a parkinsonian motor syndrome in life, and it is thought that they spread into the cortex and cause hallucinosis (occipital and temporal cortex) and other cognitive problems . Diffuse Lewy body disease (now termed 'dementia with Lewy bodies', DLB) can present with parkinsonian characteristics, but cognitive decline and hallucinosis will be early features: 60% of Alzheimer's disease patients have extrapyramidal/parkinsonian signs in the later stages . A syndrome of apathy distinct from depression, anxiety and fatigue is increasingly recognized in Parkinson's disease . Typical antipsychotic drugs (exempli gratia haloperidol, chlorpromazine) antagonize dopamine D receptors and may cause extrapyramidal side effects such as tardive dyskinesias and parkinsonism . Atypical antipsychotics (exempli gratia quetiapine, clozapine) appear to control psychosis without significantly compromising motor function and so are more suitable for treating psychosis in Parkinson's disease (Table 7.8) . REM behavior disorder in particular has emerged as an important symptom that may predict the motor diagnosis of Parkinson's disease by years . Autonomic problems occur with increasing frequency in advanced disease, as has been shown in the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest) study . This can lead to a shocking neglect of symptoms that may be treatable, even in well-established centers of Parkinson's disease care .
Many of these impairments may be detected through the use of traditional neuropsychological assessments and include abnormalities in processing speed, reasoning and problem solving, verbal and visual learning and memory, working memory and social cognition (Table 7.1) . These domains of impairment may reflect abnormalities in more basic cognitive functions, which can be detected through the use of sophisticated neurocognitive paradigms . In addition to impairments on neuropsychological measures of cognitive function, people with schizophrenia also exhibit impairments in cognitive functions assessed through the use of sophisticated computerized procedures . The results of high-risk and large-scale birth cohort studies and studies of military inductees who have developed schizophrenia provide compelling evidence that people with schizophrenia exhibit subtle neurocognitive impairments prior to the onset of more florid psychotic symptoms (Table 7.2) . The results of functional imaging studies are also consistent with the selective involvement of frontotemporal areas, although this may be due in part to the nature of the cognitive tasks studied . Several studies suggest that the cognitive impairments in patients are highly correlated with each other and that control differences between individuals with and without schizophrenia are largely due to differences in general intelligence . Patients with negative symptoms have also exhibited the most impairment on tasks requiring self-generated, rather than stimulus-driven, activity . Impairments of verbal memory, language, vigilance and executive function have been shown to be major determinants of poor social and community function in people with schizophrenia . The relationship of neurocognitive impairments to the broad range of symptom and functional outcomes suggests that the development of effective treatments for these impairments would have far-reaching beneficial effects on people with schizophrenia . Whatever else underlies the symptoms and deficits of schizophrenia, there is plainly a disturbance of brain function . Schizophrenia research has, therefore, been quick to use imaging techniques that demonstrate disturbances in brain function . The use of imaging techniques that are able to show regional cerebral blood flow or metabolism confirmed that the blood flow to regions of primary motor or sensory cortex increases by 5-10% a few seconds after movement or perception begins . A common method of investigating the abnormal brain function underpinning a cognitive deficit is to first scan a control subject before and during the execution of a relevant task . The same brain activity maps are then produced for people with schizophrenia before and during the same task, which can then be compared with the pattern in control subjects . A general finding is that people with schizophrenia tend to use aberrant networks of cortical activity, even during simple cognitive, perceptual or motor tasks and even when performance is apparently normal . Resting state fMR studies are increasingly being used, with advanced image analysis that detects correlations in activity between brain areas . Functional imaging has been informative at the level of understanding individual symptoms, symptom clusters and specific cognitive deficits in schizophrenia (Figure 7.2) . The three overlapping syndromes outlined in Chapter 2 correlate with particular cognitive deficits and with distinct patterns of brain function (Tables 7.3 and 7.4) .
Historically, the diagnosis and classification of AML was based on the French-American-British (FAB) criteria, which assigned patients to one of eight groups, designated M0-M7, based on morphologic and cytochemical features (Table 2.2) . Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells provides important independent prognostic information and is a feature of both the WHO and ELN systems . The prognostic categories using cytogenetics are 'favorable', 'intermediate' and 'adverse' risk, based on the presence of structural and/or numeric chromosomal abnormalities . Cytogenetic analysis should be performed on the bone marrow aspirate taken at diagnosis in any patient suspected to have AML . Clinical genetic testing for several mutated genes, particularly in patients with cytogenetically normal AML, can help with further risk stratification . IDH2 and IDH1 mutations may contribute to prognostication but, more importantly, identify patients likely to respond to novel therapies that target these aberrant pathways, at least in the relapsed/refractory setting (see Chapter 3) . Identification of FLT3 -ITD at diagnosis is important not only as a prognostic factor but also to identify patients who may respond to targeted treatments, such as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); several TKIs in addition to midostaurin are being investigated in AML, including quizartinib, gilteritnib, crenolanib and sorafenib . Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) usually present with vague symptoms that are consequences of pancytopenia . Rarely, patients present with symptoms due to extramedullary leukemia (id est outside the blood and marrow), such as myeloid sarcoma (a tumor mass consisting of myeloid blasts); AML may infiltrate skin, lymph nodes, the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissue or testes . Patients who present with isolated myeloid sarcoma typically develop blood and/or marrow involvement quickly thereafter . Infiltration of the gingiva, skin, soft tissues or meninges (CNS) with leukemic blasts at diagnosis is infrequent but characteristic of the monocytic subtypes (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3) and those with 11q23 chromosomal abnormalities . Anemia is usually present at diagnosis but is not severe and is usually normocytic and normochromic (the size of red blood cells and level of hemoglobin are within normal limits) . Occasionally, patients may present with no detectable leukemic cells in the blood . The presence of abnormal rod-shaped granules called Auer rods (Figure 2.1) on light microscopy of a blood smear or bone aspirate indicates a diagnosis of AML . Highest in the differential diagnosis of pancytopenia due to acute leukemia (myeloid or lymphoblastic) are other hematologic cancers with marrow infiltration, and bone marrow failure syndromes such as aplastic anemia . However, acute leukemia is the appropriate diagnosis in patients with circulating blasts visualized on light microscopy . Cytogenetics has been a part of AML diagnosis for several decades, and typically requires bone marrow for successful testing (the increased number of proliferating cells in marrow yields better results than blood for karyotype analysis) . The diagnosis of AML is based on a finding of 20% or more myeloid blasts by histology, cytochemistry or (more commonly) flow cytometry . However, this criterion is not required for diagnosis if any of the following recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities is present: t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16) .
Despite initial treatment, ovarian cancer will recur in nearly two-thirds of women who originally presented with advanced disease . Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of imaging is suboptimal in ovarian cancer, because patients often exhibit numerous postsurgical changes; moreover, recurrences can occur with small-volume disease . The choice of treatment in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer will depend on a number of patient-, drug- and tumor-related factors (Figure 7.1) . Patients in whom recurrence occurs more than 6 months after primary platinum treatment are often subdivided into two groups . highly platinum-sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs more than 12 months after primary platinum treatment . intermediately sensitive patients, in whom recurrence occurs 6-12 months after primary treatment . Platinum-resistant patients, in whom recurrence occurs within 6 months of primary platinum treatment, are generally treated with non-platinum options; these usually include single agent chemotherapies with or without bevacizumab . The initial treatment decision for a patient with platinum-sensitive disease is whether or not to perform surgery (see page 54) . Chemotherapy options for platinum-sensitive disease have continued to expand . Such patients are actively recruited for clinical trials, because this population is widely believed to show a good balance between performance status, time to recurrence and potential for response to therapy . Many platinum-sensitive patients will respond to numerous regimens; as described above, some clinicians treat patients with recurrence at 6-12 months differently to those with recurrence more than 12 months after previous platinum treatment . This is especially true when the recurrence is close to the 6-month cut-off, because many such patients have a response and prognosis similar to those who are platinum-resistant . Key Phase III clinical trials with chemotherapy in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease are summarized in Table 7.1 . Bevacizumab represents another option for platinum-sensitive patients . The OCEANS trial showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) among those treated with bevacizumab, compared with placebo, when combined with carboplatin/gemcitabine . Recently, the GOG213 study reported a significant improvement in PFS in patients treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel plus bevacizumab, compared with chemotherapy alone (median PFS 13.8 months versus 10.4 months, respectively, HR: 0.61, p < 0.0001); there was also a trend toward a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) (median 5.3 months increase, p = 0.056), which became statistically significant upon sensitivity analysis (p = 0.0447) . The challenge for clinicians will be to decide upon the best use of these agents as either treatment or maintenance options in platinum-sensitive patients . Chemotherapy for platinum-resistant disease . Patients with disease that recurs within 6 months of primary platinum treatment are generally treated with single agents, with or without bevacizumab . An important decision for clinicians is how best to use bevacizumab for the treatment of ovarian cancer . In some regions, bevacizumab is used in the front-line setting, while in others it is restricted to platinum-sensitive patients . Although the value of tumor debulking surgery is well established for the treatment of primary tumors, the value of cytoreduction for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is not well defined .
Weight reduction and increased physical activity should be priorities in obese patients to improve insulin sensitivity . Obesity is associated with an increase in symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hospitalization for GERD-related complications . Obese patients are at increased risk for biliary disease, with a higher incidence of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis and cholesterolosis . Weight loss, reversal of the metabolic abnormalities and treatment of OSA will improve plasma testosterone levels . Weight loss through a lifestyle modification program is associated with improvements in erectile dysfunction in obese men . Weight gain and central adiposity in adulthood are particularly associated with an increased risk of LUTS . Survival is decreased in obese women with cancer; this may be disease specific, the result of comorbid illnesses or a reflection of response to treatment . Obesity and metabolic syndrome are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer and also cancers with worse pathological features and higher biochemical relapse rates . The relationship between obesity and breast cancer risk as well as the clinical behavior of the disease is complicated . In postmenopausal women, particularly the elderly, obesity is positively associated with risk for breast cancer, whereas before menopause increased bodyweight is inversely related to breast cancer risk . The mechanisms by which bodyweight and obesity affect risk have been related to estrogenic activity in both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer . Excess adiposity, weight gain and weight cycling are associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer; inactivity and high energy intake are major risk factors for endometrial cancer independent of BMI . Bodyweight and BMI increase the risk of colon cancer in men, but not in women . This discrepancy may be related to differences in fat distribution between the sexes or the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in women, which lowers the risk of colon cancer . In contrast, waist circumference, a marker of abdominal obesity, is associated with colon cancer risk in men and women, although this too may vary depending on HRT use in postmenopausal women . A moderate increase in BMI, even within the normal weight range, is significantly related to knee osteoarthritis among men . An intensive weight-loss program that involves an energy-deficit diet and exercise training improves physical function in older obese adults with osteoarthritis of the knee . However, successful treatment of lower-extremity arthritis may not lead to weight loss, and obesity should be treated as an independent disease that is not necessarily the result of inactivity from arthritis . Extreme obesity is associated with an increased risk for depression, and obese individuals in weight-loss trials experience reductions in symptoms of depression . A recent study showed that metabolic syndrome itself was not linked with impaired health-related quality of life compared with what had been expected, suggesting that other associated factors such as depression and greater disease burden significantly influence quality of life . The syndrome is most frequently seen in women and is strongly associated with obesity and a recent increase in weight . Benign intracranial hypertension is resolved in some patients with morbid obesity by substantial weight loss, such as that induced by bariatric surgery .
Despite this careful approach, some patients will be unable to tolerate the neurotoxic side effects of CBZ, even at low doses and serum concentrations . High peak concentrations often result in intermittent side effects around 2 hours after dosing, necessitating administration three or four times daily in some patients . Such problems can be overcome by prescribing a controlled-release formulation that can be given twice daily, or by shifting a greater percentage of the total daily dose to bedtime, particularly when the patient has only nocturnal or early morning seizures . Drug interactions of CZP are minimal, although its half-life in adults can be slightly reduced from 17-56 hours (as monotherapy) to 12-46 hours in the presence of an enzyme-inducing AED . In all patients, the dose should be increased or decreased in 25-50 mg increments when clinically indicated, particularly when serum concentrations exceed 10 mg/liter . PHT induces hepatic enzymes and may, therefore, reduce serum concentrations of metabolized AEDs such as CBZ, VPA, lamotrigine (LTG), PER and topiramate (TPM) . PRM is effective against partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but appeared to be inferior to CBZ and PHT in clinical trials, largely because of its relatively poor tolerability (see below) . Because VPA does not exhibit a clear-cut concentration-effect-toxicity relationship and daily variations in concentration at a given dose are wide, routine monitoring is unhelpful unless closely correlated with the patient's clinical situation . ESL has been approved in Europe as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients 18 years of age or older . FBM has demonstrated effectiveness both as monotherapy and add-on therapy for partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients 14 years of age or older . It also has important efficacy as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial and generalized seizures (including atonic seizures) associated with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children . LCM is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients aged 16 years and older (17 years and older in the USA) . A pharmacodynamic interaction resulting in symptoms of neurotoxicity (headache, dizziness, nausea, diplopia, ataxia) is a common consequence when LTG is introduced in patients established on high-dose CBZ or OXC . PER is licensed as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older . Accordingly, its metabolism is induced by PHT, CBZ and OXC, so drug dosing may need to be higher in patients who are also taking these AEDs . Thereafter the total daily dose can be increased, as clinically indicated, by a maximum 150 mg every week according to individual patient response and tolerability . Its effectiveness during adjunctive therapy probably depends on its inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of other AEDs, including PHT, CBZ, PB, VPA and CLB . Higher doses (400-800 mg daily) may be required in patients taking PHT or CBZ, with lower amounts (100-200 mg) often being successful in those taking non-enzyme-inducing AEDs . VGB is an effective add-on drug for patients with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization .
Management of the symptoms can be challenging, as the elderly are less likely to tolerate surgical or pharmaceutical treatments, and their symptoms are often secondary to multiple causes . The approach to treatment of these symptoms in the elderly is similar to that in younger people, as the underlying pathophysiology of bladder disorders, such as incontinence and overactive bladder (OAB) does not differ markedly . The common causes of incontinence are similar to those found in younger people, namely bladder overactivity and sphincter weakness, but the effects of aging on the nervous system and the lower urinary tract exacerbate the symptoms . Finding the cause of urinary incontinence is more important in the elderly than in younger patients . Detrusor contractility decreases with age and therefore the incidence of urinary retention with antimuscarinic medications may be higher in the elderly . In women, urethral hypermobility becomes a less prevalent cause of urinary stress incontinence with age as vaginal mobility reduces with postmenopausal atrophy . Bladder filling symptoms may be secondary to detrusor overactivity; however, intravesical pathologies such as tumors are more likely than in younger patients and further investigation with urine culture, cytology, urodynamic studies and cystoscopy may be required . Poor detrusor contractility is common in the elderly and can impair voiding even in the absence of bladder outlet obstruction . Sensory loss is most commonly caused by diabetes; it may lead to progressive bladder distension, voiding dysfunction and acontractility, resulting in overflow incontinence . Urinary tract infections are common in elderly women, occurring in up to 46% over the course of a year . This is normally the result of multiple factors, such as impaired immunology, voiding dysfunction and urinary stasis, genital atrophy from decreased estrogen, fecal incontinence and low fluid intake . Treatment of UTIs in elderly women with no identifiable pathology is with low-dose vaginal estrogen and prophylactic antibiotics, as described in Chapter 7 . Lower urinary tract symptoms are common during pregnancy, and childbirth is often cited as a cause for subsequent urinary, colorectal and genital dysfunction . Stress urinary incontinence in pregnancy is common - it has been reported in up to 85% of pregnant women . Prenatal stress incontinence usually resolves spontaneously after delivery, and the mainstay of treatment is pelvic floor muscle exercises (see Table 3.3) . The most common cause of postnatal voiding disorders and urinary retention is the use of epidural and spinal anesthesia during labor and delivery . It should be noted that many women have reduced bladder sensation after delivery, and urinary retention may not present with pain . Failure to recognize and manage postpartum urinary retention risks long-term bladder damage as a result of overdistension, denervation and atony of the detrusor muscle, which may require long-term catheterization . The smooth muscle relaxation associated with high levels of progesterone in pregnancy may predispose women to UTIs by affecting bladder emptying and ureteric drainage . It is important to distinguish VVF from other causes of urinary incontinence; investigations should include a full examination . There is some debate as to the timing of surgical treatment of urinary tract fistulas .
Clinical gene therapy is a very active field, with a large number of clinical trials, approaches and disease targets . The defect is in a gene called MTM1 that encodes the enzyme myotubularin, which is required for the development and function of skeletal muscle . In a first clinical trial, nine patients aged from 8 months to 6 years were treated by systemic administration of a high dose of AAV8 vector, with the hope of widely transferring the MTM1 gene to muscle cells . To initially test whether hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene transfer could treat this debilitating neurological disorder, two individuals with adrenoleukodystrophy were enrolled into a study . Lentiviral gene transfer was performed with autologous HSCs, and cells were transplanted following complete myeloablative conditioning . Hope for treatment of this disease comes from preclinical studies using AAV vectors that express not a therapeutic protein but a micro (mi)RNA that targets the HTT messenger (m)RNA and induces its degradation (the miRNA machinery of post-transcriptional regulation has evolved to specifically eliminate unwanted gene expression in a given cell type) (Figure 6.1) . For example, an AAV5-miHTT vector was able to decrease production of the huntingtin protein by more than 50% in areas of gene transfer in the brains of minipigs that had been injected with the vector . Using this approach, sustained lowering of huntingtin protein levels and functional improvements have been demonstrated in a mouse model of the disease . For clinical trial design, high-resolution MRI scans of people with Huntington's disease serve to identify injection sites for safe and hopefully efficient delivery of the vector to the desired target regions of the brain . Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are rare inherited metabolic diseases that result from deficiencies in enzymes that normally aid in the degradation of molecules such as lipids or glycogen in lysosomal organelles, thereby preventing accumulation of toxic materials . An investigational gene therapy is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II trial, based on systemic delivery of an AAV8 vector with hopes of achieving stable expression and activity of G6Pase-alpha under control of its native gene promoter . Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the X-linked lethal muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin . For instance, dystrophic muscles may be inflamed, and T-cell responses against therapeutic dystrophin have been observed in some patients in prior clinical studies . More recent clinical trials have utilized lentiviral vectors with increased yield and modified treatment and mobilization regimens to improve HSC harvest and have applied more rigorous myeloablative conditioning to ensure engraftment . Results from more than 20 patients indicate that individuals with betaE/beta0 thalassemia, who have residual endogenous expression of functional beta-globin chain (in the form of the betaE variant) benefited more strongly from gene therapy and mostly achieved sustained transfusion independence, reaching nearly normal hemoglobin levels in a few cases . This individual no longer required red blood cell transfusions and had a substantial clinical improvement that has been stable for at least 4 years .
Epidemiology and prognosis . Incidence and prevalence . Epilepsy is the most common serious neurological condition . It affects nearly 70 million people in the world . In high-income countries, approximately 6 per 1000 people will develop epilepsy during their lifetime, and 45 people per 100000 will develop new-onset epilepsy each year . These figures are nearly twice as high in low- and middle-income countries, possibly as a consequence of more primitive obstetric services as well as the greater likelihood of cerebral infection and head trauma . Incidence varies greatly with age, with high rates in early childhood, low levels in early adult life and a second peak in people aged over 65 years (Figure 1.1) . In recent years, there has been a fall in the number of children affected as well as a sharp rise in epilepsy in the elderly . Indeed, old age has now become the most common time in life to develop the condition . Most patients with epilepsy have a good prognosis . The prognosis is strongly influenced by the underlying cause . In many people - particularly children - the condition will remit, although a substantial proportion will have epilepsy all their lives . Overall, 60-70% of patients become seizure free after the start of treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) . Some of these patients become and remain seizure free on the initiation of the first AED, while in others the disorder appears to follow a more fluctuating course . Some patients can remain in remission after subsequent drug withdrawal, implying that the epileptogenic causes have truly remitted . The other 30-40% of patients continue to have seizures with varying degrees of frequency and severity . It is also increasingly recognized that some patients can have a 'remitting-relapsing' course, fluctuating between periods of seizure freedom and recurrence . Factors that indicate a poor prognosis for seizure control include . poor response to the initial AED treatment . symptomatic cause . high seizure frequency before AED treatment . generalized tonic-clonic seizures . generalized epileptiform activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) . family history of epilepsy . comorbid psychiatric history . The standardized mortality ratio (the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths) for patients with epilepsy is two to three times above that of the general population . In many cases, the cause of death is related to the underlying etiology, but sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is believed to account for up to 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths . SUDEP has been defined as 'sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, non-traumatic and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, with or without evidence of a seizure, and excluding documented status epilepticus, in which postmortem examination does not reveal toxicological or anatomic cause of death' . The reported incidence of SUDEP ranges from 0.35 to 10 per 1000 patients per year . It is higher if the seizure disorder remains uncontrolled, suggesting that the majority of SUDEP is related to seizure activity . Other associated causes of death include drowning, burns, aspiration, pneumonia, status epilepticus and suicide .
Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) . Such patients often have significantly better quality of life, fewer hospital admissions (exempli gratia from dialysis-related complications), and are more likely to die finally at home rather than in hospital than patients receiving dialysis . Hemodialysis involves pumping blood from the body through an artificial kidney in which the blood is surrounded by a solution of electrolytes, called the dialysate, the concentration of which can be varied precisely . Solutes present in the blood at high concentration (exempli gratia urea, potassium, creatinine) diffuse into the dialysate and are removed (Figure 12.1) . The volume of water to be removed from the patient's blood can be controlled by altering the pressures on either side of the membrane separating the blood from the dialysate . The dialysis machine itself is simply the housing for the pumps controlling blood and dialysate flow, various safety devices (pressure sensors, air detectors), a system for maintaining blood anticoagulation in the extracorporeal circuit (usually a heparin infusion), and a screen for graphically displaying the various parameters monitored . Home hemodialysis offers patients the most autonomy, but requires a suitable house with a water supply, space (for the machine and supplies), a reasonably technically competent patient and usually a trained helper who will be present during each dialysis session . Patients dialysing at home often have the best quality of life . Some patients opt for daily hemodialysis (usually 6 days/week), which provides the best control of fluid balance and biochemistry, but is intensive . Patients can dialyse overnight while they sleep either at home or in dialysis centers . Peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneal cavity as a reservoir into which a dialysate can be infused, and the blood flowing through peritoneal capillaries as the blood source . Ultrafiltration is controlled by altering the osmolality of the dialysate solution and thus drawing water out of the patient's blood . Peritoneal dialysis is carried out by the patient at home, at work or while on holiday . The complications of peritoneal dialysis are listed in Table 12.2 . Nevertheless, there are excellent data suggesting that earlier referral for nephrological care before renal replacement therapy is required can significantly delay the need for dialysis, and reduce early morbidity and mortality . If women on dialysis do become pregnant, the outcome is usually poor with a very high risk of miscarriage, severe hypertension, small babies and prematurity . A kidney transplant provides the best long-term outcome for patients with ESKD . Patients should be aware of the risks and benefits of transplantation (Table 12.4), and require screening for occult cardiovascular disease before surgery . These drugs must be taken for life and require careful monitoring (Table 12.5) . Most patients with a transplant will die from cardiovascular disease, which should, therefore, be aggressively managed . Fertility is usually restored in women after a kidney transplant, but transplant recipients have a high risk of hypertension during pregnancy, and an increased risk of miscarriage in the first trimester and premature delivery .
The influence of social norms is also manifest in regional variations in smoking prevalence within countries . In the UK, for example, smoking prevalence increases with 'northerliness', even controlling for social class . There is a strong link between smoking and many psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, schizophrenia and substance abuse . Smoking is also prevalent among homeless people, many of whom suffer from mental health disorders . It has yet to be established why these links exist: whether smoking causes or exacerbates these conditions, whether a disorder makes it more likely that a patient will smoke and be unable to stop, or whether there is a common underlying cause . It is widely thought that smoking is particularly closely linked to schizophrenia, but in fact the dominant factors are the severity of the psychiatric disorder and whether the patient is institutionalized (Figure 3.1) . It is, however, clear that there is no evidence for deterioration overall in mental health when people with psychiatric disorders stop smoking and in some cases there may be an improvement . Smokers are particularly likely to experience problems with illicit psychoactive drugs and alcohol . The link with alcohol abuse and alcoholism is particularly strong, leading some to suggest that heavy smokers should be screened for alcoholism . A 10% increase in the price of cigarettes relative to earnings is linked, on average, to a 4% reduction in consumption by adults . In teenagers, the effect is greater, with a 10% increase in cost linked to a 10% decrease in consumption . It is important to structure it to prevent tobacco companies using pricing policies to undermine its deterrent effect . Not all of the decrease in consumption involves smokers giving up altogether; in some cases smokers merely reduce the number of cigarettes they smoke . The health benefits of this action may be undermined, however, because smokers tend to smoke each cigarette more intensively . Nevertheless, it is clear that increasing the cost of smoking is, potentially, an important public health measure . Mass media campaigns can be effective in promoting smoking cessation and reducing smoking prevalence . In many countries, including the USA, tobacco advertising is banned from television but is permitted in print media . Where there have been more comprehensive bans on promotion, there has been some evidence of an effect in reducing smoking . Several countries have implemented legislation requiring cigarette and tobacco to be sold in standard plain packages carrying graphic health warnings and the brand name in a standard font with no brand imagery . The effect is expected primarily to be on take-up of smoking - with cigarettes becoming less attractive to adolescents . Indoor smoking bans have been introduced in public indoor areas in many countries, including the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and in most jurisdictions in the USA . Although the bans were introduced to protect the health of non-smokers, there is some evidence that they might have at least a short-term effect in reducing smoking prevalence .
Anorexia nervosa is characterized by the refusal to maintain a bodyweight equal to or above a minimally normal weight for the individual's age and height . The weight loss is self-induced by several means . Individuals with anorexia exhibit an overwhelming fear of putting on weight and a distorted view of the size and shape of their body . restricting type, in which the individual does not regularly engage in binge-eating or purging behavior . binge-eating/purging type, in which the individual regularly engages in binge-eating or purging behavior . Binge-eating is characterized by eating large amounts of food in a discrete amount of time and feeling a sense of a lack of control . Purging behavior includes self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas . The specific diagnostic criteria for anorexia from the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 - Diagnosis . Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of significant binge-eating - eating large amounts of food in a discrete amount of time and feeling a sense of a lack of control - followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain . purging type, in which the individual regularly engages in purging behavior, such as self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics or enemas . non-purging type, in which the individual does not regularly engage in purging behavior, but uses other inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as fasting or excessive exercising . Those who suffer from bulimia use their binge and purge cycles to prevent weight gain and to regulate other emotional difficulties . Unlike anorexia, bulimia does not generally result in significant weight loss and in many ways is a very secretive disease . The specific DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for bulimia are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4 - Diagnosis . Definition of eating disorders not otherwise specified . DSM-IV classifies both anorexia and bulimia under a specific diagnostic category entitled 'Eating Disorders', which also includes a third classification entitled 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' ('atypical eating disorder' in the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision [ICD-10]) . This last category includes binge-eating disorder and night-eating syndrome, discussed in Chapter 9 of this book, and may be used to describe eating disorders that meet some but not all of the diagnostic criteria for anorexia or bulimia: for example, an individual with almost all of the symptoms of anorexia but who still has a normal and regular menstrual cycle and/or a normal body mass index, or cases with overevaluation of weight and shape associated with purging behaviors at least twice a week but no binge-eating episodes ('eating disorder not otherwise specified' [EDNOS] purging type) . Patients that present with subsyndromal criteria should be monitored in order to identify the development of a full-syndrome eating disorder . Primary care physicians should conduct a comprehensive assessment to uncover any significant risk factors in the patient's life that could rapidly lead to a full-syndrome eating disorder .
Worldwide, there has been a steady increase in the incidence of clinically significant prostate cancer, although in the USA the number of incidental diagnoses of prostate cancer has fallen by 28% since the US Preventive Task Force issued a draft guideline in 2011 (which became a final recommendation 2012) discouraging prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in all men (Figure 1.1) . However, prostate cancer primarily affects men over the age of 50 years, so the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer is predicted to increase substantially over the next two decades as a result of the worldwide trend towards an aging population . The incidence of prostate cancer in men who emigrate from a low- to a high-risk area increases to that of the local population within two generations . This suggests that environmental influences such as diet and lifestyle factors may have a profound effect on the development of prostate cancer and on the progression of latent to clinically detectable cancer . Epidemiology studies show that heritable factors account for a small proportion of prostate cancer risk but a higher proportion of early-onset disease . Family history is a strong risk factor for prostate cancer: the risk of a man developing prostate cancer is increased approximately 2.5-fold if he has a first-degree relative who is affected . The relative risks for developing prostate cancer based on family history are shown in Table 1.3 . Mutations in the BRCA2 breast cancer susceptibility gene are rare in men with prostate cancer but appear to be associated with earlier diagnosis and more aggressive disease, such as higher Gleason score (see pages 14 -) and higher PSA level and tumor stage and/or grade at diagnosis . In addition, men diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer often have a lower average testosterone level than men of a similar age who do not have prostate cancer . Early studies showed an increased risk of prostate cancer in obese men whereas more recent studies indicate that levels of detected prostate cancer are in fact lower in obese men . A recently published study on risk factors for prostate cancer reported that being obese was associated with a 44% increase in the risk of prostate cancer diagnosis . There is also some evidence that alpha-linoleic acid, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, increases the risk of prostate cancer and of developing advanced disease, which may be the result of oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage or the development of obesity . The risk of dying from prostate cancer is related geographically to ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and men with prostate cancer have lower levels of vitamin D . Microscopic foci of 'latent' prostate cancer are a common autopsy finding and may appear very early in life: approximately 30% of men over 50 years of age have evidence of latent disease . If the tertiary grade has a high score (4 or 5), the patient has increased risk of disease progression even if the primary and secondary grades are lower, and the tertiary rather than the secondary grade informs the score .
The characteristic history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of often insidious, yet always progressive, asymmetric weakness without prominent sensory symptoms . Individual symptoms depend on the region affected and the relative burden of upper and lower motor neuron disease . Lower motor neuron (LMN) disease causes more overt weakness, loss of muscle bulk (atrophy), muscle twitching (fasciculation) and cramps . More unusual presentations of ALS include respiratory-onset disease, with weight loss and orthopnea, and cognitive or behavioral change . Individuals with ALS may report a weak limb, hand or foot as 'dead' despite normal sensation, so it is important to clarify such language . LMN disease in the legs presents as weakness, most commonly starting in the ankle dorsiflexors . In the arms, LMN symptoms most commonly start with hand weakness, with reduced grip strength and, for example, difficulty undoing bottle tops or pinching zippers (Case report 3.1) . UMN-predominant upper-limb disease usually presents as stiffness or clumsiness with fine motor tasks, such as typing, writing or (un)fastening buttons . However, in the presence of progressive muscular weakness it is a common and important sign in ALS (see Case report 3.1) . In at least 25% of those with ALS, the onset of symptoms is in the bulbar region, a system comprising the central nuclei and motor neurons of the IXth, Xth, XIth and XIIth cranial nerves (LMN disease) or the corticobulbar tracts (UMN) . In lower motor neuron bulbar disease, the dysarthria usually involves slurring; individuals may report that they 'sound as if [they] have been drinking' . In upper motor neuron (cortico)bulbar disease, speech becomes strained and slow (Case report 3.2) . Swallowing symptoms may be similar to those reported in LMN-predominant bulbar disease, with impaired coordination of pharyngeal muscle contraction . This so-called 'split hand' in ALS is not easily explained in terms of peripheral or proximal limb innervation and may instead reflect the cortical organization associated with the uniquely opposable thumb in humans, or selective involvement of motor neuronal pools in the anterior horns of the cervical spinal cord (Figure 3.1) . Fasciculation may be missed unless the individual is undressed to expose the upper chest, back and proximal arms and legs (see Case report 3.1) . Lower motor neuron weakness in a limb characteristically affects muscles supplied by more than one peripheral nerve or nerve root . Early 'finger drop' (distal upper-limb extensor weakness) is unusual for ALS and should prompt consideration of multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (see page 62) . Upper motor neuron weakness typically affects a limb in a pyramidal pattern . Rarely, they are the presenting symptoms (approximately 3% of ALS cases are 'respiratory onset') . It is therefore important to be alert to ALS as a possible underlying cause and to examine the individual carefully for signs of motor neuron involvement (see Case report 3.3) . Individuals with respiratory-onset ALS often have associated weakness of their axial muscles . If a change in behavior or personality is raised, most usually by a family member, it is important to actively seek symptoms and signs of motor neuron involvement so that these do not go unrecognized .
Diabetic pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome for the fetus, but there is little excess mortality among diabetic women . Pregnancy may be complicated by type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and, increasingly, by type 2 diabetes . Of all pregnancies in the USA, 3-10% are complicated by diabetes (90% are cases of GDM) . There is a miscarriage rate of 9-14% among women with pre-existing diabetes . Diabetic pregnancy is linked with the development of large-for-gestational-age babies, but growth restriction in patients with pre-existing type 1 diabetes may also occur, particularly when the diabetes is associated with vascular complications . Fetal macrosomia (affecting 15-45% of babies born to diabetic women) is a frequent complication of diabetic pregnancy and increases the likelihood of birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus trauma . Metformin can be continued throughout the pregnancy by a woman with type 2 diabetes, though most women will require additional insulin . Women with type 1 diabetes should be advised of an increased risk of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness in the first trimester . The effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump therapy), particularly for those women who cannot achieve acceptable glucose control or experience troublesome hypoglycemia, is well established . Pregnancy may be hazardous to women with pre-existing complications of diabetes . The Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study in Pregnant Women (ACHOIS) has established that treatment of GDM with insulin improves pregnancy outcomes (such as birth weight, macrosomia and shoulder dystocia) . The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has attempted to achieve an international consensus on screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes . It recommends a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all women who are not known to be diabetic at 24-28 weeks . Other guidelines (for example, those from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN]) advocate a more selective approach to screening on the basis of risk factors (for example, obesity, a first-degree relative with diabetes, ethnicity, advanced maternal age, previous GDM and a previous macrosomic baby) . Those with previous GDM should start early self-monitoring of blood glucose or have a 2-hour 75 g OGTT at 16-18 weeks followed by a repeat OGTT at 28 weeks if the first test is normal . Scans to determine fetal growth and abdominal circumference help inform decisions about the need for intensive blood glucose control in GDM . The diagnosis of GDM confers the need to detect maternal hyperglycemia by intensive self-monitoring of blood glucose, preferably by postprandial testing . Women with GDM need to be informed that the condition confers an increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes and should be strongly advised to reduce this risk postnatally by reducing weight and taking regular exercise . Fasting plasma glucose should be checked at the 6-week postnatal appointment and annually thereafter to check whether the woman has progressed to type 2 diabetes . Babies born to diabetic mothers are at increased risk of developing obesity and diabetes .
. Clearly, the potential sensitivity of a given cancer to immuno-oncology therapies will depend on the ability of the tumor to trigger an immune response (immunogenicity) . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically target malignant cells are among the best characterized forms of cancer immunotherapy . Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) is a form of cell-based cancer immunotherapy in which circulating or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are collected from the patient, modified ex vivo as necessary to attack specific neoantigens, and reinfused into the patient following lymphodepletion and conditioning (Figure 3.3) . Following infusion of these cells, the patient's immune system actively surveys and engages specific cancer cells that express the antigen . Clinical trials are ongoing in patients with various hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, and an important landmark has now been reached with the first approval of a CAR-T therapy . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Kymriah™ (tisagenlecleucel, formerly CTL019) intravenous infusion for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse, based on an 82% remission rate in a multicenter Phase II registration trial . To date, Imlygic™ (T-VEC/talimogene laherparepvec) - a genetically engineered oncolytic herpes simplex viral strain that can be injected directly into locally advanced unresectable melanoma tumors - is the only oncolytic virus therapy approved by the US FDA and European Medicines Agency, based on the results of a positive Phase III randomized controlled trial . To date, only one cell-based product containing dendritic cells has been approved: Sipuleucel-T™ was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, based on a positive Phase III randomized controlled trial . With DNA-based vaccines, TAAs are encoded into a bacterial plasmid which is injected into the patient and taken up by native cells, including antigen-presenting cells (APCs); the APCs can then produce the antigen themselves to trigger an immune response . This product has been investigated in several clinical trials but the results have been conflicting: in trials that have shown clinical benefit, the vaccine was typically administered with another immuno-oncology therapy such as interleukin (IL)-2 or an immune checkpoint inhibitor . The attenuated tumor cells are then combined with an appropriate adjuvant and injected back into the patient, triggering an immune response . Of these, immune checkpoint inhibitors are currently the only agents approved for clinical use in the EU and USA, largely based on clinical benefit shown in randomized Phase II or III clinical trials . Some forms of chemo- or radiotherapy can stimulate malignant cells to express DAMPs that bind to APCs, triggering a cancer-specific immune response via a process known as immunogenic cell death (ICD) . Although this effect is not sufficient to overcome immune tolerance in cancer cells, the combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy may be beneficial . To date, however, clinical trials of this strategy have shown that such combinations are less toxic than combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies, but local and distant (abscopal) anti-tumor responses are limited .
Patients with mild acute pancreatitis (AP) (65% of cases) have an uneventful disease course, with initial severe pain that improves quickly . In contrast, patients with moderate-to-severe AP may be challenging: they may require aggressive fluid resuscitation and they have prolonged pain and sometimes intolerance to oral refeeding . Urine output is especially important for the early detection of renal failure and patients in need of aggressive fluid resuscitation . The authors suggested that hemoconcentration was the cause of pancreatic necrosis through impaired pancreatic blood flow and recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation to improve outcomes in all patients with AP . These were open-label randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a more aggressive versus a moderate fluid volume administration (10-15 vs 5-10 mL/kg/hour) and a more rapid versus a slower hemodilution (hematocrit < 35% vs >= 35% at 48 hours) in patients with severe AP according to the classic 1993 Atlanta criteria (presence of local complications and/or organ failure) . The studies had some flaws, including being open-label single-center RCTs, with suboptimal randomization, an unexpectedly high rate of sepsis in patients with aggressive resuscitation and large differences in mortality between treatment groups despite a very small sample of patients, and they require validation . A study examining goal-directed fluid resuscitation (mainly based on serum BUN) did not find an association with improved outcomes, but it was probably underpowered because to a lower than expected incidence of SIRS . In studies addressing other clinical scenarios, balanced fluids such as lactated Ringer's solution seem to be associated with a decreased need for blood products and a lower incidence of renal replacement therapy, hyperkalemia and postoperative infections when compared with normal saline . An RCT in patients with predicted mild AP showed that oral refeeding after abdominal pain has resolved is safe and shortens the duration of hospitalization compared with a more gradual reintroduction of oral feeding . Other RCTs have confirmed that early reintroduction of solid oral feeding in mild AP is safe and does not result in a higher incidence of complications or prolonged hospitalization . As intrapancreatic activation of zymogens seems to be the cornerstone of AP, and oral feeding is associated with increased secretion of enzymes, before the 1990s it was believed that 'pancreatic rest' improved outcomes in cases of moderate-to-severe AP, based mostly on basic science studies . Parenteral nutrition was associated with higher mortality, more prolonged hospital stays, a higher risk for pancreatic infections, OF and a need for surgery, so nasojejunal tube-based enteral feeding was considered as a standard of care in predicted severe disease . In 2014, the Dutch Pancreatitis Study Group published an RCT in patients with predicted severe AP which compared early (within 24 hours) nasojejunal enteral nutrition versus on-demand nasojejunal enteral nutrition (the patients tried oral refeeding on the third day and enteral nutrition was given on the fourth day only to those who could not tolerate oral feeding) . The study showed that on-demand oral feeding was not associated with worse outcomes, and only 31% of patients needed a nasojejunal tube .
In some instances, the patient may wish to start treatment after a single event because they are concerned about the potentially significant impact that recurrent seizures could have on their lifestyle, such as their ability to legally drive a car . The information should be presented to the patient in the context of what is known and what is conjecture about the risk of recurrent seizures, the chance of a successful outcome with treatment and the likelihood of remission . When prescribing an AED, the clinician must also discuss all common side effects, as well as uncommon but serious drug-related problems such as the risk of teratogenesis in women of childbearing potential . The goal of treatment should be to enable the patient to lead as normal a lifestyle as possible, which generally requires complete seizure control without, or with minimal, side effects . For these reasons, in general, serial monotherapy trials of two AEDs that are appropriate first-line treatment for the patient's seizure type(s) should be undertaken before combinations are tried (Figure 4.1) . The chance of remission is highest with the first drug - 60% of patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy achieve seizure control with the first or second AED . Substantial attention should therefore be given to choosing the most appropriate initial AED, taking into account a range of factors, including the seizure type(s) and/or epilepsy syndrome . Slow titration will help avoid concentration-dependent side effects as with carbamazepine (CBZ) or topiramate (TPM), in particular central nervous system toxicity, the presence of which is likely to discourage the patient from persevering with therapy in the long term . Measuring serum AED concentrations can help to determine the extent of compliance, assess side effects and establish the most effective dose for a seizure-free patient . If the first AED produces an idiosyncratic reaction or side effects at low or moderate doses, or fails to improve seizure control an alternative drug should be substituted . None of the newer AEDs has shown superior efficacy when tested against the established agents for the treatment of partial seizures and GTCS, but some have demonstrated better tolerability, in particular fewer neurotoxic side effects (Table 4.5) . Until definitive evidence becomes available, clinicians should also consider avoiding the use of other AEDs associated with a high risk of severe cutaneous reactions (PHT, PB, LTG and OXC) in individuals known to have the allele . As well as controlling seizures, some AEDs have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of other conditions that may coexist with epilepsy (Table 4.7) . To reduce the risk of osteoporosis, patients taking long-term AED therapy are advised to maintain the optimal level of physical activity, a balanced diet and exposure to sunshine . A small proportion of patients will become seizure free with three AEDs, but treatment with four or more is highly unlikely to be tolerated and therefore successful . If a non-epileptic cause of the symptoms is ruled out, the patient should see a neurologist or other appropriate specialist for further diagnostic studies to determine the likelihood of further seizures and to consider the need for, and choice of, AED therapy .
Given this risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage, a key aim in the treatment of ET is to prevent blood clotting and bleeding; however, it is also important to alleviate any problematic symptoms . Similarly, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations are associated with a higher risk of thrombosis than are calreticulin (CALR) mutations, and may therefore be considered an additional risk factor for thrombosis in patients with ET (Figure 4.2), although this has yet to be fully incorporated into clinical practice . In general, patients at the lowest level of risk defined by the International Prognostic Score for Essential Thrombocythemia (IPSET) scoring system (Table 3.6, page 38) - younger patients without JAK2 mutations, no cardiovascular risk factors and no history of thrombosis - can often be managed by observation only, and they may not require aspirin (yet to be validated in clinical practice) . As a general principle, all high-risk patients should be treated with aspirin (unless contraindicated) and cytoreductive therapy to reduce the platelet count . Treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk factors, and promotion of a generally healthy lifestyle, may be sufficient intervention for very-low-risk patients . There is also evidence that antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of venous thrombosis in patients with JAK2 V617F mutations and cardiovascular risk factors (arterial thrombosis) . Cytoreductive therapy does not reduce the risk of thrombosis compared with observation alone in low-risk patients with ET, and recent data from the PT-1 study have shown that early cytoreductive therapy does not reduce mortality from thrombotic events . The agents most commonly used for cytoreductive therapy in high-risk patients with ET are hydroxyurea (also known as hydroxycarbamide), interferon-(IFN)-alpha, which suppresses hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, anagrelide and busulfan (Table 4.1) . Cytoreductive treatment reduces the rate of vascular complications in high-risk patients but it is not possible to identify a specific threshold platelet count that confers optimal protection against such complications . Hydroxyurea should be considered as first-line therapy, aiming to achieve a normal platelet count . Anagrelide, IFN-alpha or busulfan may be considered for second-line treatment if the platelet count is uncontrolled with hydroxyurea . In the PT-1 study, which compared anagrelide and hydroxyurea in 809 high-risk patients with ET (defined according to the Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria), anagrelide reduced venous thrombosis rates but was associated with higher rates of arterial thrombosis, major bleeding and transformation to myelofibrosis . Furthermore, compared with hydroxyurea, anagrelide was associated with significantly higher rates of cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological and constitutional adverse events . Since the treatment of ET aims primarily to reduce the risk of thrombosis and bleeding, response criteria have traditionally focused on platelet count . Response criteria cannot be defined in low-risk patients treated with aspirin, whereas the aim of treatment in higher-risk patients receiving cytoreductive therapy is to reduce platelet counts to below 400-450 x 10 /L . In clinical practice, an inadequate response to treatment in patients with ET (or indeed PV) may be identified by various criteria, including elevated platelet or white blood cell counts, burdensome symptoms and clinical events such as thrombosis or bleeding (Table 4.2) .
Diet and lifestyle are clearly linked to the development of prostate cancer . The effects of obesity and a western-style diet as risk factors for the development of prostate cancer were mentioned in Chapter 1 . A large number of studies have evaluated the effects of dietary manipulation/supplementation in reducing the incidence of prostate cancer; the current evidence is summarized in Table 2.1 . Although randomized clinical trials have provided some indication that selenium and vitamin E have a protective effect, a large chemoprevention study (the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]), designed to determine whether they reduced the likelihood of prostate cancer when used singly or in combination, was ended prematurely because of disappointingly negative results . Cohort studies show that lycopene (in tomatoes) and isoflavonoids (found in soy products) may be associated with a decrease in the incidence of prostate cancer . A recently published but slightly dubious cohort study on risk factors for prostate cancer reported that having more than seven sexual partners increased the risk by 100%, and having more than five orgasms per month increased the risk by 59% . However, there is no evidence that reducing these factors reverses the risk! . Chemoprevention refers to the use of drugs to reduce the risk of cancer . The 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride has been shown to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer by 24.8% compared with placebo over a 7-year period, although at the cost of a small but significant increase in sexual side effects . A 2013 study reported that there was no difference in the overall survival (OS) rate, or survival after a diagnosis of prostate cancer, between the placebo-treated and finasteride-treated patients after 18 years of follow-up . Another 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, has been evaluated for its effect on the occurrence of prostate cancer in the REDUCE study (Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events) . Dutasteride resulted in a 23% reduction in the development of prostate cancer, mainly by suppressing the well-differentiated cancers, with only a slight (statistically insignificant) increase in Gleason pattern 7 or 8-10 poorly differentiated tumors . Statins have also been reported to have some chemopreventative properties although the evidence is weak and conflicting: a recent review found that only eight of 43 studies reported a positive association between statin use and a reduction in the development or progression of prostate cancer . Very few trials have investigated the effect of diet and lifestyle change on prostate cancer progression . It must be remembered that cardiovascular disease is still the primary cause of death in men, with or without prostate cancer, and heart-healthy lifestyle choices will reduce mortality in men with prostate cancer . A healthy diet and regular vigorous exercise may help protect the individual against various forms of cancer, in addition to decreasing the risk of death from cardiovascular causes . Evidence for a beneficial effect of exercise on prostate cancer-specific mortality is also increasing, and post-diagnosis recreational activity has been shown to significantly lower prostate cancer-specific mortality . The mechanism many not be merely related to decreased sedentary activity, however, as there was no association between sedentary activity and increased mortality .
The biliary and pancreatic ducts . The main pancreatic duct joins the bile duct to form the common channel or ampulla of Vater (also known as the major papilla) . In 90% of people, the embryonic dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts are fused to form this pancreatic duct, meeting in the head of the pancreas . In the other 10%, the ducts drain separately into the duodenum (pancreas divisum) and the dorsal duct (known as the accessory duct) drains through the minor papilla . Small sphincters around the ends of the main bile and pancreatic ducts control the flow of bile and pancreatic juice, respectively; the sphincter of Oddi controls the outflow from the ampulla of Vater . The gallbladder is tucked under the right liver lobe in the gallbladder fossa and is connected via the cystic duct to the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct . Bile acids, essential for the absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, are made in the liver and travel in canaliculi to reach the bile ducts . The intrahepatic bile ducts drain into the right and left hepatic ducts, which fuse to form the common hepatic duct . Epidemiology of biliary tract disease . They may cause acute biliary colic, acute cholecystitis or chronic cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis or cholangitis . Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and the most common GI cancer in Native Americans . Of the most commonly seen GI cancers in the USA, Europe and Australia, gallbladder cancer is the least common compared with other parts of the world . In most EU countries (with similar trends in the USA and Australia), mortality rates for gallbladder cancer have declined by approximately 30% among women and 10% among men, but mortality is still high in central and eastern Europe . Bile duct cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, may arise in the intra- or the extrahepatic biliary system, usually in people between 50 and 70 years of age . Sclerosing cholangitis affecting the biliary system may occur in association with diseases such as ulcerative colitis and in secondary form due to conditions such as AIDS . bicarbonate - from the duct cells (to neutralize gastric acid) . Epidemiology of pancreatic disease . In the year 2000 there were 1.15 million patients with non-malignant pancreatic disease in the USA . Each year 125 000 North Americans present with acute pancreatitis, 100 000 present with chronic pancreatitis and at least 45 000 die from diseases of the pancreas . It is estimated that about 48 960 people will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and about 40 560 people will die of pancreatic cancer in 2015 in the USA . In a study of a well-defined German population, the incidence rates for acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer per 100 000 inhabitants/year were found to be 19.7, 6.4 and 7.8 respectively . For acute pancreatitis, the highest incidence rates are in the USA and Finland . The incidence rate in Finland is 73.4 cases per 100 000 people . Similar incidence rates have been reported for Australia .
Several specific issues arise in the assessment of older brain tumor patients (Table 12.1) . The number of patients taking multiple (five or more) medications is highest among those aged 65 and older . Several studies have shown that the likelihood of receiving surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy decreases with age; however, older patients with glioblastoma can benefit from combination therapy . Surgical resection of glioblastoma may extend survival and improve quality of life in older patients who are in good health . Radiotherapy extends survival over best supportive care in older patients with glioblastoma . Several studies suggest that a shortened course of radiotherapy delivered over 2-3 weeks has efficacy similar to that of the standard 6-week regimen and this may have practical benefits for some patients . However, several studies have now shown that temozolomide is effective in older patients both in terms of tumor response and extended survival . Also, older patients receiving temozolomide during radiotherapy may have treatment-induced neurological decline . Several studies suggest that this drug may be particularly effective in older glioblastoma patients and merits further study . The current recommended standard of care for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimen followed by consolidative whole-body radiotherapy in select patients (see Chapter 10) . However, in the elderly patient, concern is often raised about the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate . Delayed neurotoxicity has been described as a consequence of whole-body radiotherapy following high-dose methotrexate, particularly in older patients, which raises a concern about appropriate use in the elderly . Assessment of renal function using creatinine clearance is a standard recommendation in geriatric oncology to guide chemotherapy dosing . Several studies have specifically looked at delivering high-dose methotrexate to elderly patients with PCNSL (Table 12.2) . Radiographic response rates of 90% or higher have been described and one study showed no difference in acute toxicity associated with methotrexate in older patients . Elderly patients with PCNSL treated with whole-body radiotherapy as consolidation following methotrexate have a significant risk of delayed neurotoxicity - estimated to be as high as 90% . Recognition of the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate and treatment-related neurotoxicity has led to the recommendation that whole-body radiotherapy should be avoided for elderly patients, and that methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone should be used as standard treatment . Older patients who are healthy with limited comorbidities and full function should be offered the standard of care . Those elderly patients who are truly frail (multiple comorbidities, complete dependence or a severe geriatric syndrome such as dementia) are most appropriately offered best supportive care . Although half of all primary and metastatic brain tumors occur in patients over the age of 65 (Figure 12.1), geriatric neuro-oncology is an area that has received limited attention . Population studies suggest that increasing age is often associated with decreasing treatment . Recent advances in the management of brain tumors raise a number of issues for older patients . Finally, the assessment of long-term toxicity associated with new therapies is often limited at the time of initial development and may present differently in older patients .
Depression and anxiety disorders frequently coexist, with community studies consistently identifying a substantial proportion of people either currently meeting the diagnostic criteria for, or having a lifetime history of, both conditions . Depression is differentiated from adjustment disorder, which is a rather broad and ill-defined category comprising the emotional or behavioral response to a stressful event, characterized by marked distress or clearly reduced social functioning . An important distinction is made between 'unipolar' forms of depression, such as major depression and persistent depressive disorder, and bipolar depression, which is the form of depression found among individuals who have had an episode of hypomania or mania . The defining characteristic of this disorder is having an episode of elevated mood and increased energy, differentiated by level of severity as either mania (bipolar I disorder) or hypomania (bipolar II disorder), as well as episodes of depression that are referred to as bipolar depression . The diagnosis of bipolar disorder is based on the person experiencing an episode of abnormally and persistently elevated or irritable mood (Table 2.4) . In the ICD-10 classification, bipolar affective disorder is diagnosed on the basis of more than a single episode of elevated mood, which is categorized as mania or the less extreme form, hypomania . 'Depression', or 'clinical depression', refers to a mood disorder that ranges in severity from mild to severe, in duration from brief to enduring, and in pattern of illness from single to recurrent episodes . Some important aspects of validity adopted from psychometric theory are relevant to considering the robustness of the concept of depression as a disorder: there is good evidence of the concurrent and predictive validity of this diagnosis; the diagnosis is associated consistently with disability, reduced quality of life and particular service needs; and there is extensive literature indicating the suffering that is associated with the condition and the natural history of the illness, its response to various treatments and its relationship to other conditions . In the DSM-5 classification, the central condition of 'depression' is 'major depressive disorder', which is experienced as a single or recurrent episode . This classification also has a number of specifiers relating to severity, remission status, pattern of illness (single or recurrent episodes, seasonality), onset (specifying a perinatal onset) and clinical features, as well as describing subtypes of depression (Figure 2.1) . A diagnosis of (major) depression is based on a person experiencing a particular group of unpleasant persistent symptoms that affect mood, thinking, motivation and physical functions and have clear effects on the person's ability to conduct normal activities . Major depression needs to be distinguished from normal bereavement where similar symptoms may occur; however, a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss may be considered . This is part of the symptom picture for around 15% of people who fulfill the criteria for a major depressive episode, providing a 0.4% lifetime risk for major depression with psychotic features . It is not considered a separate mood disorder from major depression: its symptoms are no different from depression symptoms arising at other times in life .
However, the development of diabetic neuropathy is thought to depend on many factors in addition to hyperglycemic exposure, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, increased height and alcohol . Once established, this type of neuropathy is usually resistant to treatment other than the use of drugs for symptomatic pain relief . Aside from the unpleasant symptoms, the significance of this type of neuropathy is that once severe, sensory loss - together with lower-limb ischemia - becomes a major risk factor for the development of neuropathic ulceration and a Charçot joint . Smoking and excess alcohol intake are associated with more severe symptoms in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) . Abnormal tests of autonomic function are frequently found in diabetic patients, particularly in those with clinical evidence of sensory neuropathy . However, symptoms attributable to autonomic neuropathy are uncommon and are usually seen in those patients with a history of longstanding poorly controlled type 1 diabetes . Autonomic neuropathy may cause erectile dysfunction, although failure of erection in diabetic patients is now thought largely to be due to underlying vascular disease . VEGF has been identified as having a major role in the genesis of diabetic retinopathy, and many ophthalmologists use intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF agents to treat diabetic macular edema based on their success in the treatment of age-related macular edema . Proteinuria occurs in 15-40% of patients with type 1 diabetes and rarely develops before 10 years' duration . Patients who have diabetic nephropathy usually exhibit evidence of retinopathy and neuropathy . Antihypertensive therapy irrespective of the agent used will slow the development of diabetic nephropathy; however, the use of ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure has been associated with superior clinical benefit in this context, probably because ACE inhibitors reduce intraglomerular capillary pressure, leading to a reduction in proteinuria . Treatment with ACE inhibitors also delays the development of diabetic nephropathy in patients with microalbuminuria . Around 15% of patients with diabetes will develop a foot ulcer, and this has enormous associated healthcare costs . Ulceration of the foot in diabetes almost always occurs on a background of diabetic neuropathy and medium- and small-vessel disease compounded often by abnormal foot biomechanics (Figure 9.12) . Risk factors for macrovascular disease in diabetic patients include those that apply to the background population, but hypertension and hyperlipidemia are particularly important in patients with type 2 diabetes . In the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study, intensive treatment of blood pressure to achieve a target of 140/81 mmHg was associated with a 66% reduction in mortality in people with diabetes . A number of studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors reduce urinary albumin excretion rates, delay the development of proteinuria in those with microalbuminuria and reduce the risk of dialysis, renal transplantation and death; these findings make ACE inhibitors the drugs of first choice in the treatment of hypertension in diabetic patients . However, in many studies, the use of a thiazide diuretic or a beta-blocker has been associated with an increased likelihood of developing diabetes that is not seen with ACE inhibitors .
Relapsed and refractory PTCL are associated with dismal outcomes, with median overall survival (OS) of 5.3 months reported in a population-based retrospective series of 163 patients from British Columbia . Several novel agents have recently been approved for the treatment of relapsed and refractory PTCL, and studies are defining how these agents are best used (id est as monotherapy or in combination) to improve survival outcomes . Single agents approved for relapsed or refractory PTCL include pralatrexate, romidepsin and belinostat . PROPEL was a Phase II single-arm trial of pralatrexate in 115 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL . An early trial involving 47 patients with relapsed PTCL reported an ORR of 38% (18% CR) and a median duration of response (DOR) of 8.9 months . A subsequent multicenter single-arm registration study of 130 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL (including 69 with PTCL-NOS, 27 with AITL and 21 with ALK − ALCL) reported an ORR of 25% (19% CR); the ORR was 29% in PTCL-NOS, 30% in AITL and 24% in ALK - ALCL . A Phase II study in 24 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL or CTCL demonstrated an ORR of 25%, with 8% CR . The pivotal single-arm Phase II trial of belinostat in relapsed and refractory PTCL (BELIEF) enrolled 129 patients and reported a similar ORR of 26%, with 11% CR . Notably, the response rate was higher in patients with AITL than in those with ALK − ALCL or PTCL-NOS (ORR 46%, 5% and 23%, respectively) . A Phase II registration study of brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy in 58 patients with relapsed/refractory ALCL reported an ORR of 86%, with CR in 57% of patients . In a Phase II study of 35 patients with mature T-cell lymphomas of other subtypes with variable CD30 expression, ORR was 33% for PTCL-NOS and 54% for AITL, with CR rates of 14% and 38%, respectively . The registration trial that supported approval in Japan was a multicenter Phase II study in patients with relapsed or refractory ATLL, who received mogamulizumab intravenously at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg weekly for 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks . A prospective study that compared mogamulizumab versus the investigator's choice of treatment of ATLL, conducted in the USA and Europe, reported best response rates of 28% and 8%, respectively . In a Phase I study of duvelisib, 25-100 mg daily, in patients with CTCL and PTCL (19 and 16 patients, respectively), the ORR was 50% in patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL, with 3 CR, and a median PFS of 8.3 months . A Phase II study of alisertib in 37 patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL reported an ORR of 30% . A randomized Phase III trial compared alisertib, 50 mg daily for 7 days of a 21-day cycle, versus the investigator's choice of treatment (romidepsin, pralatrexate or gemcitabine) in 271 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL . Several single-arm trials exploring lenalidomide, 25 mg per day for 21 consecutive days in 28-day cycles, reported response rates of 22-30% in heavily pretreated patients with AITL, ALCL or PTCL-NOS .
In general, however, these adjustments to hypovolemia are poorly suited to pump failure, and increases in the preload and afterload of the failing heart lead to worsening HF (Figure 2.1) . Neurohormonal pathways activated in HF include the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the natriuretic peptide (NP) system . Sympathetic activation of the adrenergic system leads to vasoconstriction, which increases the resistance to blood flow and helps to maintain arterial pressure in the early stages of HF when cardiac output is reduced . However, vasoconstriction also increases the afterload on the heart, leading to a worsening of HF (see Figure 2.1) . Angiotensin II causes systemic vasoconstriction and acts on the adrenal cortex to produce aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention . Sympathetic stimulation also releases antidiuretic hormone, which leads to retention of free water and contributes to dilutional hyponatremia . NPs, mainly BNP, lead to increased sodium excretion and vasodilation, especially in the early phases of HF . In end-stage HF, the peptides may not be released because of myocyte loss . Cytokine release is increased in HF, leading to a variety of consequences including apoptosis . Global and local responses to maladaptive stimuli lead to myocardial remodeling, namely increased myocardial volume and mass and a net loss of myocytes . This is not a response that can keep occurring indefinitely - eventually a loss of LV function will occur due to reduced interaction between contractile elements, caused by their separation . The increase of sympathetic tone associated with HF leads to disturbance of the autonomic reflexes . It contributes to the disturbance of myocyte energy metabolism, leading to the description of the failing heart as 'an engine out of fuel' . Causes of insulin resistance include the underlying etiologies of HF (central obesity, diabetes mellitus) and loss of skeletal muscle (see below) . Loss of skeletal muscle is an important manifestation of HF, reflecting inactivity, consequences of circulating substances such as tumor growth factor (TGF)-beta and reduced cardiac output . In its most advanced manifestation, loss of skeletal muscle may lead to cachexia . The consequences of this process include contributions to insulin resistance as well as loss of the skeletal muscle circulatory bed . More marked disturbances of renal function, leading to coexisting renal failure, may also occur and pose problems for volume control . The American Cardiology Association (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines divide progression of the disease into four preclinical and clinical stages (Table 2.1) . It is important to distinguish these from functional classes, as described in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system, which is based on severity of symptoms and exercise capacity and can be used to assess response to treatment (see Table 2.1) . ACC/AHA stages A and B are preclinical; these patients fall into NYHA functional class I . ACC/AHA stage C reflects patients with symptoms or signs of HF, so these patients may be classified functionally in any of the NYHA classes I to III .
Dispelling popular myths about acne can have a positive effect on a person's motivation to cope with the condition, improve adherence to treatment and stop the patient from adopting unnecessary or potentially harmful behavior (see page 17) . For moderate-to-severe disease, oral therapies (see Chapter 6) will be required for variable lengths of time; for example, a course of oral antibiotics may be given for 3 months . Treatment with oral isotretinoin may last for 6-12 months according to the severity of the disease and the clinical response of the patient . Pamphlets and online resources that summarize the cause of the disease and the principles of its treatment are available from the American Academy of Dermatology, the British Association of Dermatology, acne support groups and from some pharmaceutical companies (see Useful resources, page 100) . Early treatment of acne is likely, although not proven, to prevent or modify development of the disease; thus, early use of appropriate topical therapy in mild acne (see below) may well prevent development of moderate acne . Comedonal acne with a mild inflammatory component can be managed with topical retinoids as first-line therapy (see pages 51-3) . In general, 40-80% of patients with non-inflammatory or mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne respond to topical therapy; this minimizes potential adverse effects associated with the use of systemic agents . However, given the more significant and more diverse side-effect profiles of systemic therapies - and the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance to oral antibiotics - this requires careful patient selection and management . Resistance should be suspected if a patient's acne fails to respond, or improves then worsens after 3 months of treatment . Global overutilization of antibiotics and the resulting emergence of antibacterial resistance (see pages 91-3) have led to calls to limit the use of oral antibiotics in acne treatments . Since microcomedones are thought to be the precursor lesions of both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne, a topical retinoid regimen aimed at reducing microcomedones may be useful as maintenance therapy following treatment with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin (see below) . As with regimens containing oral antibiotics, if the patient has comedones in addition to inflammatory lesions, agents such as topical retinoids should be added to the antiacne regimen . It is strongly recommended that patients with severe inflammatory cystic acne who are at risk of complications such as these be referred to a dermatologist for treatment with isotretinoin and possibly a concomitant course of oral corticosteroids . Since its inception, the use of oral isotretinoin treatment has been responsible for a dramatic improvement in the appearance and psychological wellbeing of numerous individuals affected by moderate-to-severe acne . acnes resistance should be suspected in patients who are not responding, patients who were responding but have relapsed, and those who have had 2-3 courses of different topical and oral antibiotics . Poor adherence to treatment is the main reason for poor response, usually as a result of inadequate instructions or the failure to emphasize to the patient the need for long-term and continued therapy, provided there are no side effects and progress is adequate .
Cancers that are clearly confined to the bladder can potentially be cured if the primary tumor can be removed or ablated, through surgery, radiation therapy or multimodality approaches, and there is no metastatic disease; 5-year survival rates are about 70% . Cancers predominantly involving the bladder but where there is small-volume overt metastatic disease are unlikely to be cured with currently available modalities; treatment is therefore palliative in intent, which must be clearly understood from the outset . Five-year survival for patients with metastatic disease is approximately 5%, although this varies depending on the bulk of disease, response to therapy and patient factors, including comorbidities . The mainstay of therapy is systemic treatment to control the progression of metastatic disease although management of the primary cancer may be necessary to alleviate symptoms and to prevent future complications such as pain, intractable hematuria and upper urinary tract obstruction . Surgery or radiation therapy may therefore be necessary for management of the primary tumor, and sometimes for management of metastatic disease . Cancers where the bulk of disease is metastatic are currently incurable; the intention of treatment is therefore palliative . This chapter summarizes current clinical recommendations for the systemic therapy of loco-regional advanced or metastatic disease . The first combination chemotherapy regimen to be widely used in clinical practice was cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine (CMV), which showed an overall response rate of 56% in a small single-arm study, half of which were complete remissions (notably in the era before computed tomography) . CMV and MVAC have been the mainstay of chemotherapy for metastatic urothelial bladder cancer for many years . Unfortunately, however, both regimens are difficult to deliver safely and are associated with substantial toxicity, including bone marrow suppression, neutropenic sepsis, mucositis, neuropathy, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting, requiring frequent hospitalization, and sometimes leading to treatment-related death . The treatment of metastatic bladder cancer was transformed following publication of a randomized Phase III trial comparing MVAC versus gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) . However, GC was found to be better tolerated than MVAC and was adopted as standard of care for the treatment of metastatic disease . Chemotherapy regimens in common use for the first-line treatment of metastatic bladder cancer are summarized in Table 7.1 . The dosing and scheduling details of cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for advanced or metastatic bladder cancer are summarized in Table 7.2 . Patients with GFR of 40-60 mL/min can often be managed safely by splitting the cisplatin dose over 2 weeks (although there is little evidence to support this approach) . These points need to be considered when deciding whether cisplatin is appropriate for a specific patient, and when designing clinical trials . The general principles of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease are summarized in Table 7.3 . Active treatment may still be appropriate, particularly if symptoms are amenable to such therapies and the patient is well enough to tolerate them . It is therefore reasonable to consider surgery, radiation therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy or other active approaches within the context of supportive care and palliative intent .
Measures within the trial process must demonstrate the product's safety and efficacy to regulators before it is allowed to be labeled and marketed for use by patients . However, measurement in clinical trials does not only inform regulatory decision-making . Early in the development of a new drug or novel medical device, a company will make business decisions about whether to advance its new product for further testing . Digital measures allow for the collection of data outside of the clinic, providing a more continuous stream of data points on whether the drug or device is working or not . Additionally, measurement data from clinical trials inform reimbursement decisions, which impacts the value of the market . In countries like the US that depend on third-party (exempli gratia non-government) payers, insurance companies need evidence to decide whether to reimburse the manufacturer for their approved product and at what price . In fact, medical product manufacturers, regulators, patients and ethics review boards all worry about burdening participants with excessive tasks, activities and technologies . Traditional clinical trials collect snippets of data when a participant visits the study site and represent a tiny snapshot of patients' lived experience with a disease or condition . Digital measurements will convert that snapshot into a movie, with the ability to collect near continuous data outside the physical confines of the clinical environment, such as in a person's home, using connected products, including smartphones, wearables, implantables and ingestible devices and sensors . Digital tools enable new forms of research such as decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), which are conducted outside of the clinic to capture data about a study participant in their day-to-day life (Figure 8.2) . In newer direct-to-patient or remote trials, participant data are collected in the home or in the study participant's natural environment . In the past, most data were collected via an intermediary - someone from the team would record information in a custom software system and/or case report form . As digital tools advance, we can collect more endpoint-supporting data at home via digital surveys and sensors, and study teams can 'visit' patients at home via telemedicine conference calls . A doctor who remote teleconferences with a patient would be conducting a 'remote trial', but they might collect the data manually through a survey, so the study would not be considered a 'virtual trial' . The regulatory definition of real-world data is the data collected outside of a traditional clinical study, such as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) . In the context of a traditional RCT, if study participants contribute to some measurements at home, such as pain measurement via an electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) or step count from a wearable sensor, many often mistakenly believe this would constitute real-world data . However, these measures would not constitute real-world data because the participants have been preselected for study entry by the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a given trial . Therefore, when working with clinical research, it is important to focus on the benefits of health-related data collected in natural settings - which may not be classified as 'real world' by a strict regulatory definition .
The most essential stages in diagnosis, however, still require suspicion of lymphoma from the clinical presentation and the taking of an adequate biopsy (such as an excision node biopsy or core biopsy) with basic histology and immunohistochemistry . Although this usually provides adequate tissue for accurate diagnosis with current techniques, excisional biopsy of accessible lymph nodes is preferred . Once tissue has been obtained, it is fixed, sectioned and stained with labeled antibodies that identify particular antigens expressed on abnormal cells (see below) . The histological appearance of a tissue section obtained at biopsy is essential for lymphoma diagnosis . For example, identification of the typical Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cell in the appropriate cellular background leads to a diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (Figure 3.3), while replacement of the normal lymph-node architecture by monotypic lymphocytes arranged in follicles points to a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (Figure 3.4) . The pathological distinction between these two types of lymphoma is usually relatively straightforward, based on histology and immunophenotyping (see below) . Lymphomas can then be further subdivided into distinct entities based on the characteristic morphology, immunophenotype and cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities (Figure 3.5) . For example, Burkitt, mantle cell and follicular lymphomas have characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities . However, the technique is also increasingly used to analyze diseased lymph nodes, though the tissue must first be disrupted . Furthermore, certain subtypes of lymphoproliferative disorders are associated with specific patterns of cell surface protein expression, which can be detected by immunophenotyping . In hematologic disorders, including lymphomas, abnormalities in both the number and structure of chromosomes are associated with malignant cells . Cells for analysis are obtained from a blood sample, or a bone-marrow or lymph-node biopsy . An example is Burkitt lymphoma, which is associated in most cases with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14 . Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) is used to identify chromosomal abnormalities that are difficult to recognize by conventional cytogenetics (Figure 3.10) and can be performed on either interphase or metaphase cells . An example in mantle cell lymphoma is shown in Figure 3.11 . Although not widely used in routine clinical laboratories, PCR may be used in the future to identify very small amounts of lymphoma-associated genetic changes (such as translocations) that cannot be detected by cytogenetics or FISH . It was hypothesized that the patterns of up- and down-regulation detected by gene expression microarrays may be useful in determining new subtypes of lymphoma that have prognostic importance and may, therefore, affect treatment decisions . Expression microarray studies have identified two major groups of DLBCL, which are associated with different outcomes . Gene-expression microarrays have been applied to the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma . Studies have shown that gene-expression profiling (GEP) of cases of classic Burkitt lymphoma, diagnosed by expert hematopathologists, identifies a signature that differs from that of DLBCL . Specifically, in one study, up to one-third of cases with a Burkitt gene expression profile had been called DLBCL by the pathologist . Conversely, a few cases that were diagnosed as Burkitt lymphoma had the gene expression profile of DLBCL .
Intra-articular corticosteroids have been used in OA since the 1950s, although relatively few randomized controlled trials using these agents have been carried out . As most readers will be aware, there are a number of different corticosteroid preparations but experts have not reached consensus on what dose or which particular agent should be used for a given OA joint . In general, a greater dose of drug is given into a large joint (exempli gratia methylprednisolone, 80 mg for the knee versus 10 mg in the base of the thumb) . On balance, steroid injection studies, including a recent individual patient data meta-analysis, have shown a moderate benefit in reducing symptoms for 1-3 weeks after injection . Most studies have focused on knee OA, but a 2016 systematic review supports similar benefit in patients with hip OA . It should be noted that intra-articular injection may miss the joint, even when given by experts . The increasing use of ultrasonography may be a valuable addition to the assessment of OA joints and, more particularly, in correct placement of intra-articular therapies . In OA, intra-articular steroids may be useful in patients . Most commonly, steroid injections are administered as a pain 'circuit-breaker' to allow appropriate exercises to be performed . Although injection can be useful in patients with a large knee effusion that interferes with function, the presence of an effusion does not automatically warrant intra-articular therapy, although aspiration may be helpful . As most Baker's cysts communicate with the knee joint cavity, intra-articular steroid into the knee joint often reduces fluid production and leakage from the cyst . Intra-articular injections are usually performed using an aseptic technique . The major risk from intra-articular injection is that of septic arthritis, which is thankfully extremely uncommon when proper preparation of the site and technique are used . Certainly, prolonged repeated use of intra-articular steroid alone is not optimal management of OA and other options should be discussed with appropriate experts . Proof of concept of intra-articular dwell time was further demonstrated in a study showing no short-term blood glucose disruption after injection in diabetics with knee OA . Such extended-release formulations may change how we view the use of intra-articular steroid injections in clinical practice . In particular, HA is generally cleared from the joint within 24 hours and any mechanism of action must therefore take into account the prolonged clinical benefits reported . Many clinical trials of HA therapy, the vast majority in OA of the knee, have been conducted . On balance, these clinical trials have demonstrated, at best, a modest benefit in reducing symptoms, starting with improvements immediately after the course of injections, peaking at around 2 months, and persisting for up to 6 months . The most common side effect of these therapies is a post-injection flare up of knee pain (sometimes with florid synovitis), which is quite uncommon . As with all intra-articular therapies, there is a very small risk of infection . However, the trials were all of low to moderate quality, used a variety of different protocols and preparations of PRP, and did not assess structural benefit or harms or longer-term outcomes .
