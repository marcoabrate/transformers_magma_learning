In addition, one type of mutation that is common in leukemia is a chromosome translocation, resulting in the formation of a novel fusion gene . The importance of identifying driver mutations such as this is underlined in CML, in which tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib have revolutionized the lives of patients with this condition (Figure 2.2) . The identification of chromosomal abnormalities in leukemias has resulted in appropriate treatment stratification for patients with these conditions . In contrast, patients with a complex karyotype (a karyotype with multiple chromosomal mutations) or monosomy 5 or 7 (the presence of only one chromosome 5 or 7, rather than the normal pair) have a poor response to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and require further consolidation treatment such as allogeneic stem cell transplantation . In CLL, patients with mutations affecting the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) have a poor treatment response to conventional chemotherapy and are often managed with novel therapies, for example Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib . Characterization of the mutations found in large cohorts of patients with AML is providing insights into the molecular cooperativity between different mutations, and further studies may suggest how they interact . However, in both ALL and AML the leukemia is characterized by highly proliferative immature cells that are blocked from differentiating . For example, IDH2 inhibition can be achieved with enasidenib, resulting in differentiation of blasts and some clinically significant responses in patients with AML (see Chapter 5) . Significant numbers of patients with leukemia relapse with the same clone of cells as that identified at diagnosis, suggesting that a subpopulation within the clone has intrinsic treatment resistance . Relapse then occurs when this leukemic stem cell population is able to reconstitute the leukemia . Other workers have sought to identify the related counterpart to leukemic stem cells in normal hematopoiesis which, in both CML and AML, is likely to be an intermediate committed progenitor with aberrant self-renewal abilities (Figure 2.6) . As discussed at the start of this chapter, there are four main types of leukemia: AML, ALL, CML and CLL . The underlying pathophysiology in AML is the maturational arrest of early-stage myeloid progenitor cells as a result of chromosomal translocations and other genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities (as discussed earlier in this chapter) . The traditional morphologically based classification of AML was based on the FAB criteria, which assigned patients to one of eight groups, designated M0-M7 based on morphological and cytochemical features (Table 2.1) . The underlying pathophysiology in ALL is the maturational arrest of early-stage lymphoid progenitor cells as a result of chromosomal translocations and other genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities (as discussed earlier in this chapter) . The recognition of these different phases of disease is important as they relate to greatly differing responses to treatment (see Chapter 5), and may suggest the need for more aggressive treatment, such as stem cell transplantation .","The four main types of leukemia are acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The acute leukemias are predominantly characterized by the uncontrolled growth of immature poorly differentiated cells that are blocked from further differentiation. The chronic leukemias are characterized by maturing proliferative later-stage cells. The main reason for the development of leukemia is the accumulation of gene mutations over time. Chromosomal translocations are common. The identification of chromosomal abnormalities aids treatment stratification in patients. New-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized the discovery of mutations in leukemia. Malignant clonal subpopulations identified at diagnosis have also been identified at relapse. Prognosis depends on the genetic abnormalities involved, as well as other clinical factors."
9781908541086,ch_8,"Rapid identification of the condition and early intervention is of paramount importance given the definitive evidence that patients with a duration of illness of less than 1-2 years, particularly adolescents and those with reasonably functional families, have a higher chance of recovery . The evidence indicates that individual, familial, nutritional, medical and psychological aspects of anorexia should all be addressed using a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach . The average length of hospital stay in the USA is about 1-2 weeks, with inpatient treatment limited to brief acute weight restoration and nutritional rehabilitation (Table 6.2) . The Society of Adolescent Medicine's publication of medical treatment guidelines suggests a consistent pattern of acute hospitalization for patients with anorexia (see Table 6.1) . Because of the high cost of inpatient treatment and its disruptive effect on normal adolescent life, various outpatient approaches to individual, family and group therapy have been employed in the treatment of anorexia . The literature on the comparative efficacy of various psychological approaches in anorexia is very limited (three controlled trials) and does not demonstrate any significant difference between the therapies considered . A small controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of CBT as a post-hospitalization treatment for anorexia in adults found reduced relapse rates and improved outcomes . In randomized controlled trials in patients with anorexia, CBT was not found to be superior to other types of treatment such as psychoanalytic psychotherapy, cognitive-analytic therapy, family therapy for 1 year and low-contact routine treatment . At present, the most evidence-based approach to anorexia treatment, particularly in adolescents, is family therapy . In one of the most successful treatment model interventions, the Maudsley family therapy method, developed at the Maudsley Hospital in London, UK, the parents are encouraged to take charge of the patient's eating until weight is restored and normal eating resumed . Generally, it is recommended to wait until weight is restored before administering drug treatments because eating-disorder symptoms and associated psychopathological features (such as anxiety and depression) may remit with weight gain . As yet, however, there have been only three small controlled studies supporting the efficacy of an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine) in adults with anorexia, and only case reports and small series for adolescents with the disorder . Olanzapine can be given at 5-12.5 mg/day and is the only medication which has demonstrated an adjunctive effect for inpatient treatment of underweight women with anorexia in controlled studies; risperidone has been used at doses of 0.5-1.5 mg/day . Another study showed no benefit following weight restoration, and fluoxetine was not found to be superior to placebo for inpatients with anorexia who were also receiving behavioral therapy . Prokinetic agents (medications that improve gastric emptying), id est metoclopramide, bethanechol and domperidone, have been suggested as possible adjuvants to help patients with anorexia to eat; however, some of these drugs have a depressant effect on the central nervous system and none has been studied with a controlled design . Cyproheptadine, a serotonin and histamine antagonist that can produce weight gain in the treatment of children with asthma, has been tested for women with anorexia in two controlled studies .","Up to 40% of patients with anorexia are readmitted to the hospital at least once for weight restoration and nutritional rehabilitation; the length of stay becomes longer with each successive hospitalization. Cognitive-behavior therapy and other psychotherapeutic techniques are an integral part of most multimodal treatment programs for anorexia, for both outpatients and inpatients. Patients with anorexia can be treated with antipsychotic medication in dire situations and in crises, as these medications become effective relatively quickly. Appropriate targets are the patient's obsession regarding weight and body shape (which often resemble a delusion), extreme anxiety regarding re-feeding, and psychotic states. Some second-generation atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole have a more favorable side-effect profile than the traditional antipsychotics, including a higher ratio of serotonin-to-dopamine blockade and weight gain. Tricyclic antidepressants are not recommended for the treatment of patients with anorexia because of the potential for arrhythmia at low bodyweight, a risk of lethal overdose and concern surrounding sudden death in young people. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can target anxiety and depression if efficacy is not of immediate concern. They have a more manageable side-effect profile than the atypical antipsychotics, but treatment should be monitored carefully for suicidality, weight gain or loss, emotional activation and agitation. Further research is needed to establish the efficacy of SSRIs in preventing relapse in weight-restored individuals."
9781910797907,chp4,"The diagnosis of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency begins with an assessment of a patient's history, clinical signs/symptoms and laboratory markers of chronic hemolytic anemia . Most importantly, diagnosis is assisted by evidence of reduced PK enzyme activity together with the detection of compound heterozygous and homozygous mutations in the PKLR gene . Many different mutations in the PKLR gene have been associated with PK deficiency and about one-quarter of patients will have a novel mutation . Early onset of symptoms is usually associated with a more severe clinical course, and infants and young children can be transfusion dependent shortly after birth . As discussed in Chapter 1, anemia occasionally may be well tolerated in patients with PK deficiency because of the increased levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in a rightward shift in the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve . Hemoglobin levels in patients with PK deficiency typically range from 6-12 g/dL and increase by about 1.6 g/dL after splenectomy . In PK-deficient patients, splenectomy usually results in a conspicuous rise in the reticulocyte count . In fact, patients with only mild clinical signs may display severely reduced PK activity and vice versa . Other factors that may give rise to false-normal levels of PK activity in PK-deficient patients include incomplete platelet and leukocyte removal during preparation of a sample for testing, compensatory expression of the PK-M2 isoenzyme (see page 14) and recent transfusions . Therefore, genotyping of the PKLR gene is strongly recommended to confirm a diagnosis of PK deficiency, particularly before splenectomy, which is contraindicated in some forms of chronic hemolytic anemia, such as hereditary stomatocytosis . With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques for diagnostic purposes, PKLR is typically included in gene panels designed for the diagnosis of hereditary hemolytic anemias . In fact, there are patients who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for PKLR mutations who show normal PK activity . At present, most reference centers screen for PK deficiency by measuring PK enzymatic activity and then confirm suspected PK deficiency by DNA sequence analysis of the PKLR gene . In a few centers, screening for PK deficiency is initially performed by NGS panels and then (in the case of an identified novel mutation) confirmed by PK enzymatic activity . The severe phenotype was commonly associated with disruptive mutations (id est stop codon, frameshift, splicing and large deletions) and with missense mutations directly involving the active site or affecting protein stability . The very few patients with homozygous 'null' mutations (resulting in the absence of a functional protein) displayed intrauterine growth retardation, severe anemia at birth, transfusion dependence and, in rare cases, intrauterine death or death in the first days of life . As shown in Table 2.1, the most frequent mutation associated with the moderate phenotype is 1529GàA (commonly found in white American and northern European populations and resulting in the production of glutamine instead of arginine) in either homozygous or compound heterozygous presentations . The NM/NM group had a more severe phenotype, with earlier diagnosis, more severe anemia, a higher rate of splenectomy, a greater need for transfusion and higher ferritin levels .","Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency should be considered in patients with signs/symptoms and laboratory findings of chronic hemolytic anemia (including those with mild anemia), reticulocytosis, jaundice, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, gallstones and splenomegaly. The diagnosis of PK deficiency is made by measuring PK enzymatic activity in red blood cell lysates by spectrophotometric assay. The diagnosis should be confirmed by the demonstration of known causative PKLR mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous presentations."
9781910797907,chp1,"Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency affecting the glycolytic pathway used by red blood cells (RBCs) to generate energy . Mature RBCs lack a nucleus, ribosomes and mitochondria: as a result, they are incapable of cell division and protein synthesis, and are unable to generate energy through oxidative phosphorylation, as occurs in other cell types . Under normal conditions, approximately 90% of glucose metabolism in RBCs occurs via the glycolytic pathway, with 5-10% metabolized via the HMP shunt . The key product of the HMP shunt is NADPH, the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate . The HMP shunt is the only source of NADPH in RBCs, and under conditions of increased oxidative stress the amount of glucose entering the shunt can rise significantly . The most common enzyme disorder of RBCs in humans is glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency . This X-linked disorder affects more than 400 million people globally and disrupts the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate in the HMP shunt (see Figure 1.1) . In contrast to G6PD deficiency, hemolytic anemias resulting from disorders of glycolytic enzymes are relatively rare, affecting only a few thousand individuals worldwide . While abnormalities in virtually every enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway have been described, PK deficiency is the most common associated with hemolysis, accounting for more than 90% of cases . Pyruvate kinase deficiency impairs normal glucose metabolism, resulting in inadequate ATP (energy) production by RBCs . In severely affected RBCs, the reduced levels of ATP lead to cell injury, a loss of membrane plasticity and the formation of rigid RBCs, which are destroyed in the spleen and liver . In some PK-deficient patients with high reticulocyte counts, ATP levels may be normal or even elevated . Since reticulocytes retain mitochondria, PK-deficient reticulocytes are able to generate ATP by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation rather than relying solely on the glycolytic pathway . The availability of oxygen and glucose within the spleen is limited, restricting the ability of PK-deficient reticulocytes to produce ATP via oxidative phosphorylation . PK deficiency also results in a build-up of 2,3-DPG, an intermediate product of the glycolytic pathway (see Figure 1.1) . Consequently, patients with PK deficiency anemia may tolerate lower levels of hemoglobin than people with other forms of anemia in which 2,3-DPG is not elevated . Most glycolytic enzyme disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (the exception is phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, which is an X-linked disorder) . Individuals who are heterozygous for a mutation almost always show no hematologic abnormalities, although the level of enzyme activity within their RBCs is reduced . Instead, most individuals with hemolytic anemia due to a deficiency in a glycolytic enzyme are heterozygous for two different enzyme variants . More generally, the hemolysis resulting from an enzyme deficiency can manifest as chronic anemia of varying severity, reticulocytosis and some degree of indirect hyperbilirubinemia . PK deficiency was originally thought to result from decreased production of a structurally normal enzyme . In one severe form of PK deficiency (PK Beppu), the PK-M2 isozyme persists in mature erythrocytes .","Normal mature red blood cells (RBCs) rely on the breakdown of glucose via the glycolytic pathway to produce energy. The hexose monophosphate shunt protects RBCs from oxidant damage. Pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency affects the penultimate step of the glycolytic pathway, impairing the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and reducing the amount of energy produced by RBCs. PK deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is the most common glycolytic defect associated with hemolysis."
9781908541963,chapter5,"primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which affects the microscopic bile ducts . primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which can involve any elements of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system . AIH and PBC are predominantly autoimmune diseases, but the categorization is less clear-cut with PSC . Some diagnostic confusion can occur because of the existence of 'overlap syndromes' or histological progression from apparent AIH to either PBC or PSC . AIH is a chronic inflammatory liver disease of at least 6 months' duration . The classic finding on liver histology is portal inflammation, with plasma cells and lymphocytes spilling over into the lobule in a pattern called interface hepatitis (Figure 5.1) . AIH can present as an acute hepatitis-like illness, with jaundice and a laboratory profile showing hyperbilirubinemia and a marked elevation in serum aminotransferases (transaminases) . Alternatively, patients may present with established cirrhosis in the absence of any previous episode of jaundice or other symptoms alerting to the presence of chronic hepatitis . These patients may present with liver failure or complications of portal hypertension . However, the intensity of necro-inflammatory activity may be understated by the serum aminotransferase levels, and repeat biopsy is recommended to confirm disease remission or if withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy is being considered . Flares in disease activity occur in patients on stable long-term therapy and after reductions in drug dose . Liver transplantation is an effective therapy for advanced disease . However, a liver biopsy may be of value in staging the severity of the disease . The cause of the itch is unclear, but it responds in many cases to therapies that deplete bile salts (exempli gratia colestyramine [cholestyramine]) . Hypothyroidism develops in up to 20% of patients with PBC, so it is important to screen regularly for this as a cause of the lethargy . Encephalopathy is less common than in other causes of end-stage chronic liver disease . Liver transplantation is still the only effective treatment for advanced PBC . There is evidence that PBC recurs in the transplanted liver, but this phenomenon appears to be of little clinical relevance in the first 10-15 years after transplantation . The diagnosis of PSC may be suggested by the detection of elevated cholestatic enzymes, particularly alkaline phosphatase, on routine screening of patients with inflammatory bowel disease . Screening for malignant transformation is not effective in detecting early disease, and progression to cholangiocarcinoma is generally regarded as a contraindication to liver transplantation . This ameliorates pruritus, improves the liver biochemistry and histology and may alter the natural history of the disease . Liver transplantation is used widely for advanced disease . Diagnostic confusion may arise in some patients who manifest features of more than one autoimmune disease . Patients with early PBC may have florid interface hepatitis on liver biopsy, but this should not be confused with AIH . Other patients have features of AIH and a cholangiopathy, and these are considered to have an 'overlap syndrome' or autoimmune cholangiopathy . These patients are managed as if they had both diseases (id est with corticosteroids and UDCA) .","Autoimmune liver disease can target the hepatocyte or any element of the bile duct system. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is potentially treatable if diagnosed before the development of cirrhosis. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease, with a presymptomatic period of up to 20 years. Liver transplantation is an excellent treatment for end-stage AIH and PBC. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and is unpredictable; late disease can be managed effectively with liver transplantation unless complicated by cholangiocarcinoma."
9781910797273,chp9,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) can almost span a lifetime: average time from disease onset to death is 48 years . Use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs; see Chapter 5) may reduce time to secondary progression, and there is soft evidence of a positive effect on all-cause mortality from the long-term (21-year) follow up of patients randomized to interferon beta (IFNbeta)-1b in the pivotal Phase III trial of that therapy . Death is usually caused by a complication rather than as a direct result of a MS exacerbation (Table 9.1) . However, secondary progression ensues in up to 75% of patients with relapsing remitting disease and is marked by inexorable decline that is unaffected by current approved treatments . Some medications under review may decrease disease progression, potentially reducing long-term disability and mortality risk . A cohesive multidisciplinary team (see Chapter 8) is important to effectively manage this phase of the disease . Neuropsychiatric complications, including depression and cognitive impairment, can limit or impede interactions with healthcare services . Early intervention from the palliative care team can be highly beneficial to the patient's quality of life . As far as possible, control over the effects of the disease process should remain with the patient . The World Health Organization states that palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems - physical, psychosocial and spiritual . Palliative care is commonly perceived as a type of care only available at the end stages of a disease, usually cancer . Aspects of MS that may benefit from the input of the palliative care team are shown in Table 9.2 . People with MS who are no longer mobile are at risk of developing pressure sores . Multidisciplinary management should involve the nutritionist, to ensure the provision of adequate nutrition to maintain healthy skin, and the tissue viability specialist team who will advise on mattresses, cushions and appropriate dressings to help minimize the risk of pressure sore development . When dysphagia, apathy from depression or cognitive impairment develops, people with MS may not be able to maintain their nutritional intake . However, the decision to proceed with PEG feeding is complex and reflects the individual's experience and quality of life . This decision is often included in an advance directive (see below) . As individuals may reach a point where they are no longer deemed to have the capacity to make decisions about their own care, these decisions clearly need to be made in advance . The legal power of these documents varies from one jurisdiction to another, but advance directives are a vital part of the decision-making process (Table 9.3) . Lasting (UK), enduring (Australia) or durable (USA) power of attorney is an alternative to an advance directive, whereby a person with MS can appoint a person to make decisions regarding their care once they are no longer able to .","Natural history studies suggest that life expectancy of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is reduced by 6-7 years compared with unaffected individuals, and comorbidities further increase the risk of mortality in people with MS. The average time from disease onset to mortality is 48 years. Early introduction of disease-modifying therapy may positively affect long-term mortality. Palliative care offers patients improved quality of life in the later stages of the disease. Advance planning can help people with MS achieve the control they need in late disease."
9781910797587,chp04,"In more recent studies, using weight-bearing radiographic protocols, two quite potent risk factors for progression have been identified - limb malalignment and the MRI feature of bone-marrow lesions . It demonstrated that, at a molecular genetic level, OA risk is not the same at different joint sites, id est a polymorphism can be associated with hip OA but not knee OA . Epigenetics has also developed as a new and important area of OA research over the past decade, with studies mainly focusing on microRNAs and DNA methylation levels for genes implicated in OA in articular cartilage, primary chondrocytes and transformed chondrogenic cell lines . A number of studies have demonstrated an association between increased bodyweight and OA of the knee (clinical and structural), but the association with hip OA is weaker; surprisingly, an association with hand OA may also exist, albeit less robust, suggesting systemic factors other than mechanical loading may be important . Obesity is associated with increased levels of adipokines (cytokines derived from adipose tissue), which may confer an inflammatory risk factor on synovial joints . Studies have suggested a generalized increase in bone mass in women with OA of the hands, adding to theories on the role of subchondral bone in the pathogenesis of OA . Lower levels of vitamin D (an essential component of normal bone biology) have been associated with a greater risk of knee OA progression in some studies, but the association remains controversial . There is good epidemiological evidence, including some longitudinal studies, of association between certain occupations and OA incidence, especially of the hip, knee and hands . The knee joint has probably been best studied in this regard, especially in athletes in whom repetitive high-weight loading is associated with increased rates of OA . A history of joint injury is the most significant risk factor for the later development of OA of the knee and also of the hip . Although there are few good longitudinal studies in this area, it appears that for certain high-impact sports (exempli gratia football) at the elite level (id est national/international competition) there is an associated increased risk of OA after adjusting for injury . Several studies suggest that recreational physical and athletic activity (not at the elite level) does not increase the risk of developing knee OA in a healthy joint . Clinical studies in women with OA of the hands have looked at bone taken from non-weight-bearing sites distant from the involved joints and have demonstrated a generalized increase in bone mass . Other studies have confirmed increased BMD in patients with generalized OA, and demonstrated quantitative and qualitative changes in the degree of mineralization and growth factor content of bone . Traditional research into structure-pain associations relied on the conventional radiograph, which predominantly images only bone and a surrogate measure of cartilage (the joint space) . MRI studies have shown the following abnormalities to be related to knee pain, though it should be noted that even these pathologies have only weak pain associations .","The osteoarthritis (OA) phenotype represents a common endpoint of multiple insults that result in failure of the joint. The findings of genome-wide association studies and research into the epigenetics of OA have the potential to identify new etiologic pathways and OA phenotypes, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The risk factors differ for incidence and progression. There are multiple potential peripheral sources of pain in the pathological OA joint, but the role of spinal and central pain pathways has not been well explored."
9781908541680,ch_11,"A plethora of online tools, publications and weight-loss programs are available for the management of obesity at both an individual level in clinical practice and on a larger scale within the community, and evidence of their effectiveness is beginning to emerge . org) is a community multidisciplinary program for overweight and obese children and their families, currently in use in the USA . It places equal emphasis on (M)ind, (E)xercise, (N)utrition and (D)iet (although the 'D' now stands for 'do it!'), combining all the elements known to be vital in treating and preventing overweight or obesity in children, including family involvement, practical education in nutrition and diet, increasing physical activity and behavioral change . There are a variety of 10-week programs aimed at different age groups (2-4, 5-7, 7-13 and teens) comprising either one or two sessions a week in which participants learn about, for example, portion sizes, nutrition and healthy eating alongside enjoyable active play .

Rather than using a linear approach, the OBEMAN program allows management to start at any point (diet, physical activity, education, etc . org) is an evidence-based weight management program for use in primary care . The model is based on weight management advisers: dietitians specializing in obesity management who train and support primary practice staff to incorporate the program into existing healthcare services . The objective of the Counterweight program is to achieve and maintain a medically valuable weight loss of 5-10% for as many people as possible, starting with lifestyle intervention . Although developed for implementation in primary care trusts, Counterweight can be adapted for use in other settings - in Scotland there is some interest in providing the service through community pharmacy . Counterweight Plus was developed as a non-surgical weight management program for individuals with greater weight loss needs, commencing with a total diet replacement of 810 kcal followed by stepped food reintroduction and weight loss maintenance . In total, 62% of patients with an initial BMI of > 40kg/m completed the liquid diet phase and achieved a mean weight loss of 17.4 kg . EPODE is an obesity prevention program that aims to integrate healthier lifestyles into daily life . The integration of nutritional education into the school curriculum, for example, can change the dietary behavior of children and their families . For example, if you have children at school join the Parent Teacher Association and ensure that the school has a healthy food and drink environment, provides plenty of opportunities for physical activity, and includes education on health and nutrition and the importance of physical activity on the curriculum .","There are successful models for every stage of obesity, including prevention, childhood obesity and the treatment and management of adult obesity. There is robust evidence indicating the effectiveness of the MEND program for children and the Counterweight program for adults. The obesity prevention program EPODE has had proven success with a whole-community approach to the integration of healthier lifestyles into daily life, including the addition of nutritional education to school curriculums. Since water is the appropriate drink for hydration, a tax on all sugar-containing/carbonated drinks is probably the most logical fiscal measure that governments could implement to tackle obesity. Health professionals have an ethical and moral obligation, and the opportunity, to promote public health as well as taking care of individual patients."
9781912776238,ch9,"This and the following chapter summarize the important special issues that arose in approving these biosimilars, as discussed in European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) briefings and discussions . The need for epoetin biosimilars is underlined by forecasts suggesting that the increasing incidence of cancer, chronic kidney disease, and anemia associated with HIV will drive annual growth of 11.5% . Outbreaks of epoetin-associated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA; Table 9.2) followed formulation changes to reference epoetin alfa in Europe (Eprex) . The US FDA issued a Public Health Advisory and a clinical alert over the use of epoetins in cancer patients following a higher proportion of deaths in the epoetin arms of trials looking to expand the label into prevention of anemia associated with chemotherapy (which differs from treatment of established anemia) and as a sensitizer for curative radiation therapy . As a result, the label for treating anemia associated with cancer chemotherapy was 'black boxed' in the USA, and the EMA issued a drug alert and mandated a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) . Process changes to darbepoetin (hyperglycosylated long-acting epoetin alfa) resulted in analytic differences between what the EMA called 'darbepoetin alfa RB' and 'darbepoetin alfa HT' that required Phase I pharmacokinetics, Phase III efficacy/safety and Phase IV clinical confirmatory studies for continuing European approval . The immunogenicity of biosimilar epoetin was assessed for comparability in analytics and clinical confirmatory studies . An updated meta-analysis of more than 60 randomized trials assessed for the REMS program showed that the association of poorer outcomes with epoetin was confined to off-label trials looking to extend approved indications rather than the core indication of treatment of symptomatic chemotherapy-induced anemia and avoidance of transfusion . As a result, biosimilar epoetin alfa Retacrit was approved by 14 votes to 1 and the FDA closed the REMS program for treating patients with anemia related to associated myelosuppressive chemotherapy . The probability of discovering a clinically meaningful difference between reference and biosimilar brands is likely to be greater in volunteers with normal bone marrow function than in cancer patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy - this was seriously proposed as the confirmatory clinical study for a pegfilgrastim biosimilar to the US regulator by one biosimilar maker . A month prior to the meeting, Pioneer trial data released at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) showed no loss of efficacy when six sequential brand switches were applied to G-CSF-Zarxio and reference Neupogen during docetaxel (Taxotere), adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) chemotherapy in 218 patients with breast cancer . The third comparison is between the 96 patients in arms 1 and 4 who remain on the same brand of filgrastim through chemotherapy and the 96 patients in arms 2 and 3, who switch brands on each alternate chemotherapy cycle; this explores whether brand switching leads to loss of efficacy or increased toxicity (especially immunogenicity), and anticipated the US regulator's requirement for clinical data to support a further label as an 'interchangeable biosimilar' .","No biosimilar has been approved for which comparable immunogenicity in regulatory studies has not predicted real-world outcomes in more than 10 years of European experience. For epoetin, comparable composite outcomes were found in more than 13 000 patients treated with reference or biosimilar epoetins and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, which reassured the regulator about the safety of biosimilar epoetin for symptomatic chemotherapy-induced anemia. The design of the four-arm Pioneer study allowed data collection for participants who switched from originator to biosimilar filgrastim or vice versa on each round of chemotherapy, in anticipation of regulatory requirements to demonstrate interchangeability."
9781908541062,ch_8,"First, which patients with inflammatory synovitis of recent onset will develop chronic and progressive, as opposed to mild and self-limiting, disease? The 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria have been developed to help predict the development of chronic and damaging synovitis in individuals with recent-onset inflammatory arthritis (see Chapter 5) . For example, a swollen-joint count and a measure of the acute-phase response provide useful objective measures . At this stage of the disease, it usually reflects the degree of joint inflammation, although later the cumulative effects of damage to tendons, ligaments, cartilage and bone contribute more (Figure 7.1) . Therefore, in accordance with the variable manifestations and outcomes of RA, composite assessment criteria have been devised, although debate continues regarding the 'minimal data set' needed to provide a reliable picture of the individual patient . The ACR response criteria were designed for assessing outcomes in the clinical trials setting . These measure changes from baseline in the number of tender and swollen joints, acute-phase response, a functional measure (exempli gratia HAQ score), visual analog scale for pain, and global assessment of disease by patient and physician, also on a visual analog scale . In contrast, the disease activity score (DAS; Figure 7.3) provides a continuous variable which does not require reference to a baseline . The DAS is a complex measure that was derived by studying a number of disease activity criteria in patients with variable disease activity, and applying assorted statistical measures, including discriminant analysis and multiple regression analysis . The former is a simple numerical sum of joint counts, patient and clinician global assessments and C-reactive protein (CRP); the latter removes CRP from the calculation, providing a 'bedside' composite score . Many patients can also reliably perform their own joint counts, providing further self-assessment information . Functional impairment in chronic RA is influenced by the amount of joint damage (see Figure 7.1) . In essence, these quantify radiographic change in a number of prespecified joints of the hands (and the feet in the modified Sharp score) to provide a single score . The rate of progression and severity of joint damage are both relevant to functional impairment . Some of these assays are starting to provide useful information in the clinical trial setting, when applied to groups of patients receiving different treatments . Currently, however, none has sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be applied routinely in the clinic to provide an index of tissue damage for the individual patient . Thus, synovitis may be present on MRI or HRUS in the absence of clinically detectable inflammation, and may underlie the progression of joint damage in some patients during apparent clinical 'remission' . RA can still result in severe disability and a dependent existence, but increasingly effective drugs and management strategies have improved the outlook for the majority of patients . It is not possible to provide a completely accurate picture for each patient, but a number of prognostic factors have now been defined .","Rheumatoid arthritis can be assessed using objective clinical scores such as swollen-joint counts, biochemical and radiological parameters such as acute-phase response and joint X-rays, and subjective measures of pain, function and participation. Most information is captured in composite scores such as the disease activity score (DAS). Quality of life is of overriding importance to the patient, and should always be considered during routine assessments. A number of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are being developed that quantify symptoms such as fatigue and sleep."
9781908541420,ch_6,"They include anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, sodium cromoglicate, nedocromil sodium and leukotriene modifiers, and long-acting bronchodilators such as long-acting beta -agonists (LABAs), omalizumab and sustained-release theophylline . Inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclometasone (beclomethasone) dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone, fluticasone furoate and ciclesonide, are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents currently available for asthma management . Inhaled corticosteroids are also useful in the treatment of persistent asthma because they reduce the need for oral corticosteroids and have fewer systemic adverse effects . Leukotriene modifiers can be used to treat mild persistent asthma, especially in children for whom the use of inhaled corticosteroids is limited because of concerns regarding the effects on growth . Long-term treatment with inhaled preparations of LABAs improves symptoms and lung function, relieves nocturnal asthma and reduces the need for short-acting beta -agonists (SABAs) . Currently, omalizumab is listed as appropriate for Step 5 asthma treatment (from GINA guidelines, see Figure 4.6): that is, for patients who have poorly controlled asthma despite maximal doses of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs . They are certainly the best drugs for relieving acute bronchospasm and associated symptoms, but their increased use by a patient is a sign of worsening asthma and the need for greater use of controller (preventer) drugs . Some trials indicate that this approach can be effective in preventing exacerbations as patients will receive increased inhaled corticosteroid as well as bronchodilator therapy at the first sign of worsening symptoms as they use their reliever medications . Currently, the only single inhaler approach to demonstrate effective regular preventer and as-needed reliever therapy in clinical studies is the budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler as formoterol (unlike salmeterol) has a rapid onset of action, enabling its use as a reliever medication in a single-inhaler treatment plan . It involves the regular use of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid medication (Table 4.6) in addition to a rapidly acting beta -agonist for symptom relief as needed . While the best available evidence supports inhaled corticosteroids for asthma treatment at this level for prevention of exacerbations and symptom control, leukotriene modifiers are an alternative at this treatment step . Patients who still have symptoms of uncontrolled asthma despite using a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, or those with more severe symptoms without treatment, should progress to step 3 . This involves the addition of a LABA to regularly administered low-dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy and as-needed short-acting reliever therapy . The available evidence suggests that use of a LABA at this level provides symptom control superior to that from increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids . This relies on the use of a rapid- and long-acting beta -agonist (formoterol) in combination with a low-dose formulation of inhaled corticosteroid (usually budesonide, 200-400 µg twice daily) to be used as both controller and reliever therapy . Patients with more severe asthma and persistent symptoms despite step 3 treatment should be treated with escalating doses of inhaled corticosteroid and LABA therapy in addition to a SABA . The highest level of treatment, step 5, involves the addition of oral corticosteroid treatment and/or anti-IgE therapy for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of high-dose controller inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs .","Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks. Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy. Increased use of relievers (short-acting beta -agonists) indicates inadequate disease control. Asthma therapy should be tailored to disease severity; current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment. Any exacerbation should prompt a review of maintenance medications. All patients with asthma should have a written asthma action plan. If recommended treatment fails, adherence and diagnosis should be re-examined before treatment is escalated."
9781912776276,chp4,"This is achieved by recognizing well-characterized clinical characteristics not shared by other psychotic syndromes, understanding the timing of onset and duration of PDP symptoms, and excluding differential diagnoses (Figure 4.1) . The most common psychotic symptoms in PDP are hallucinations, illusions, delusions and delusional misidentification (see page 7) . Other psychotic manifestations, as are commonly present in primary psychiatric disorders, such as disorganized thinking, word salad, thought broadcasting, command hallucinations and passivity phenomena, with rare exception, do not occur . While additions to drug treatment are a frequent cause of psychotic symptoms, PDP may develop 'out of the blue', in the absence of any medication change for months or even years . Hallucinations are usually visual, occurring in about 90% of people with PDP . Visual hallucinations may look real or distorted, and generally have no emotional content . Visual hallucinations mostly occur in a low-stimulus environment (exempli gratia a patient sitting alone watching TV, most often in the evening or at night) . Patients may recognize these phenomena as hallucinations and not be bothered by them, especially if they occur only occasionally and for short durations . Patients usually have insight into the fantastic nature of the hallucinations, recognizing them as medication side effects, but may be unsure because the hallucinations seem so real . Delusions are usually serious problems as they tend to be paranoid in nature and cause difficulties both for the patient and the caregivers . In the context of DLB, other delusional misidentification symptoms are common, such as misidentifying TV images, photographs or reflections in the mirror as real people . Since visual hallucinations are the most common psychotic symptom, the differential diagnosis may include Charles Bonnet syndrome, a disorder in which patients with severely impaired vision have visual hallucinations . Auditory 'release' hallucinations associated with hearing loss are less common but do occur . Psychotic symptoms associated with primary psychiatric disorders . Distinguishing the psychotic symptoms associated with, for example, depression, bipolar disease or schizophrenia, from those caused by PD rests on recognizing the symptoms typical of PDP and atypical for the primary psychiatric disorder (Case report 4.1) . The delusions in PDP, while paranoid, generally do not involve complex schemes, thought broadcasting, feelings that people are talking about them, aliens or fantastic possibilities, like being the reincarnation of Napoleon . Hallucinations in PDP are primarily visual, benign and with no emotional content, whereas those experienced as part of a primary psychiatric disorder are usually auditory and egosyntonic, id est they reinforce the mood that the patient is in . Patients with PDP who have loose associations, as are typical in schizophrenia, are almost always demented or delirious . Patients with PDP commonly experience other psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety, depression, irritability, agitation and aggression . PDP primarily consists of visual hallucinations, whereas those in schizophrenia are primarily auditory . The CGIS makes no distinctions between the presence of hallucinations and delusions, or the duration of the problem, but simply ascribes a single digit to how severely the disorder affects the patient .","Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) typically manifests as visual hallucinations. Auditory, tactile and olfactory hallucinations are less common. Psychotic symptoms may be present as part of a delirium. Behaviors associated with sleep may be difficult to distinguish from psychotic symptoms. Vivid dreams may be perceived as real, and brief episodes of dream continuation on awakening cannot always be distinguished from PDP. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disease or major depression may have psychotic symptoms from these disorders rather than PDP. Comorbid psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety work synergistically with the psychosis, each making the other worse. The Clinical Global Impressions Scale is a simple short tool for assessing PDP in clinical practice; it reflects the actual clinical evaluation."
9781908541796,chapter9,"For many years, the nature of the disease was unclear because of some very unusual features of the malignant cell - the Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cell . It does deserve its own category of disease, however, as the pathology, clinical course, response to treatment and prognosis are different from all other lymphoma subtypes . Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is very different from cHL in that the malignant cell is called a lymphocytic and histiocytic (LandH) or 'popcorn' cell . Around 1800 new cases of Hodgkin lymphoma are diagnosed every year in the UK, with young people aged 15-35 years usually affected . Bone marrow biopsies are rarely necessary in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma as PET scanning is better than marrow biopsy at picking up marrow disease, and data show that in this context the results of bone-marrow biopsy are very unlikely to affect management . Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma is much less common than its classic counterpart and behaves very differently . Presentation is nearly always with a single enlarged lymph node and disease is usually at a very early stage . Most centers now treat favorable disease with two to four cycles of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD), followed by radiotherapy to only those areas directly affected by the disease (involved-field or involved-site radiotherapy) . Trials are ongoing as to whether it is safe to omit the radiotherapy entirely in patients who respond very well to chemotherapy as judged by a negative PET scan after two or three courses of ABVD . If indicated, further treatment may include radiotherapy alone or rituximab (as most cases are CD20+), while combination chemotherapy is reserved for more widespread disease or transformation . Most centers treat late-stage disease with six to eight cycles of combination chemotherapy, usually ABVD, together with radiotherapy to sites of bulky disease . There is evidence that the more intensive escalated BEACOPP regimen cures a higher proportion of patients but is associated with higher rates of toxicity, including reduced fertility . It is unclear whether this regimen results in better overall survival rates, as patients relapsing after ABVD can often be successfully treated . In view of this, several studies are investigating the role of 'intensifying' chemotherapy in patients whose PET scans are positive after two to three cycles of ABVD and of de-escalating treatment (for example, by omitting bleomycin) in those who are negative at this point . In view of the fact that HRS cells express CD30, the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin has been evaluated in patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and has been shown to produce high response rates . As the prognosis for young patients with Hodgkin lymphoma improves, concern is now shifting to the long-term toxicities associated with treatment . More modern chemotherapy regimens are expected to reduce these late effects, but concern remains that a significant proportion of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma may be being overtreated . Although studies often implicate radiotherapy as being particularly associated with late toxicity, the higher-dose chemotherapy regimens (exempli gratia escalated BEACOPP) may carry a significant risk of myelodysplasia .","Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively common form of lymphoma that predominantly affects young people and is curable. There are two main types with distinct immunophenotypes and clinical pictures: classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (nLPHL). Diagnosis is by biopsy and identification of Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells in cHL, or lymphocytic and histiocytic cells (LandH) in nLPHL. HRS cells are typically CD15+ and CD30+; LandH cells have a characteristic B-cell phenotype. Treatment of early-stage cHL involves two to four courses of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD), often with involved-field radiotherapy. Treatment of late-stage cHL involves six to eight courses of combination chemotherapy (usually ABVD). The cure rate is 90-95% for early-stage disease and 75-80% for late-stage disease. Because of the high cure rates, a major aim of future treatment strategies is to reduce the long-term effects of treatment, such as secondary cancers and heart disease."
9781910797853,chp1,"It begins with the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from the major arteries of a developing embryo, which eventually seed the bone marrow . After birth, a steady 'pool' of HSCs, from which all blood cells arise, is maintained in the bone marrow by the carefully orchestrated regulation of HSC self-renewal and differentiation . HSCs in the bone marrow subsequently develop into other terminally differentiated cells such as erythrocytes, granulocytes and monocytes (Figure 1.1) . HSCs give rise to both myeloid and lymphoid lineages of blood cells . The second fundamental attribute of HSCs is the ability to self-renew to provide a continuous source of blood cells throughout the human lifespan . One way in which this is regulated is through the loss of self-renewal properties in differentiated cells such as neutrophils and monocytes . The precursors of fully differentiated neutrophils and erythrocytes bear intermediate properties between the final cells and the HSCs . For example, when common lymphoid progenitors are transplanted into irradiated mice, they give rise only to lymphocytes (Figure 1.2a) . These studies have further revised the models of hematopoiesis, with some suggesting that hematopoietic development is a continuous process rather than one involving sequential subpopulations with increasingly restricted lineage potential . Regulation of normal blood cell development . Cytokines provide a signal to cells to proliferate and differentiate . For example, dormant HSCs can be stimulated by the cytokine interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) to produce more proliferative oligopotent stem cells that can differentiate into other cells such as neutrophils . Other cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), drive differentiation of progenitor cells into neutrophils and monocytes . This suggests that the role of cytokines is to allow the survival of HSCs, which enables them to fully differentiate . In one study, the exogenous expression of specific cytokine receptors (interleukin-2 and GM-CSF) in progenitor cells that had already commenced lymphoid development enabled transdifferentiation of the cells into myeloid development . This study suggests that cytokine signaling can regulate cell-fate decisions . For example, although knockout of the erythropoietin receptor results in the absence of mature erythrocytes, early erythroid progenitors can still persist, in part because of the likely compensatory effect of thrombopoietin signaling, which normally regulates platelet production . Transcription factors are vital in the regulation of hematopoiesis . For example, a simple twofold increase in the levels of the transcription factor GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) blocks differentiation of hematopoietic cells in mice . Powerful experimental data also show the ability of ectopically expressed transcription factors to transdifferentiate committed hematopoietic cells into different lineages (Figure 1.3) . Mice with a knockout of the CEBPA gene lack mature neutrophils, suggesting that this gene is vital for their development . The importance of transcription factors in hematopoiesis is underlined by the ability of C/EBPalpha to transdifferentiate cells into neutrophils (see Figure 1.3) . Using retroviral vectors, overexpression of CEBPA can rapidly force lymphoid progenitors, lymphocytes and even AML cells into mature myeloid cells such as neutrophils .",Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop into terminally differentiated myeloid and lymphoid cells through intermediate progenitor cells. The lineage of hematopoietic cells has been extensively studied using flow cytometry and traditional transplantation techniques. The precursors of fully differentiated blood cells have intermediate properties between the final cells and the HSCs. Developmental potential becomes increasingly restricted. The self-renewal of HSCs is a highly regulated process that provides a continuous source of blood cells in adult humans. Cytokines such as interferon-alpha and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor provide signals to HSCs to proliferate and differentiate. Transcription factors are also vital in the regulation of hematopoiesis.

Verification and validation (VandV) are two processes that, together, indicate whether a digital measurement tool is fit for purpose . Once you have arrived at a construct to measure and you have some ideas about the way a digital tool could be used to measure it, there are a number of ways to assure yourself and others that the tool generates high-quality, meaningful and trustworthy data . By undertaking verification assessments, the investigator can also be assured that the relevant firmware/software that generates processed data is also accurate, precise, consistent and uniform . Verification answers the question 'did I make the tool right?' Verification is an engineering assessment, and it is entirely separate from data collection from humans . Validation is the process of ensuring that the digital measurement tool is meeting its intended use by generating objective data that accurately represent the concept of interest - the specific way in which the patient feels, functions or survives - that it purports to be measuring . For example, is the algorithm accurately processing raw accelerometry data to calculate gait speed in a particular patient population? Is the measurement of interest reflecting the concept of interest - the specific way in which the patient feels, functions or survives? For example, is gait speed a meaningful measure that reflects how a particular patient population feels, functions or survives? . To answer whether the technology is measuring what it is intended to measure (clinical validation) and is correct (analytic validation), developers should work with researchers to ensure that validation studies are well designed .

For the DMD example, a more inclusive digital measurement could be of upper limb mobility, which can be applied to a much broader population of DMD patients . However, there would be little utility in trying to tether this new digital measure against the legacy standard of a 6-minute walk test . The Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), a public private partnership co-founded by Duke University and the FDA, has developed comprehensive recommendations and resources on developing digital measurement tools for use as clinical trial endpoints . This may be a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand the body of evidence that is required to support the use of a digital medicine tool in a clinical trial . But that is changing: many clinically validated endpoints used in research will likely transition into clinical care . A number of companies are working toward a universal vision of human digital measurement across the continuum of research and clinical care . Similarly, a number of big tech companies are also developing digital measures for clinical settings .","Verification evaluates the capture and transference of a sensor-generated signal into collected data.

9781908541406,ch_10,"Although hemophilia A and B are the most common severe coagulation disorders, congenital and acquired deficiencies of all the other clotting factors occur and can lead to a range of bleeding states that may cause diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties . Most of these disorders have autosomal-recessive traits; heterozygote individuals are asymptomatic, with clotting factor levels of about 50% . The severe form of all clotting factor deficiencies, with the exception of FXIII, is detected by the routine screening tests for coagulation (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], prothrombin time [PT] and fibrinogen) . As well as congenital disorders, acquired clotting factor deficiencies can result from their increased consumption (in association with massive hemorrhage or major surgery) or the presence of an autoantibody against a single clotting factor . Venous thromboembolism, which is observed in over half of individuals, occurs in association with pregnancy and surgery, or following infusions of fibrinogen-containing concentrates . Treatment or prevention of bleeding is with a virally inactivated plasma-derived fibrinogen concentrate . Individuals with a moderate FVII deficiency (2-10% factor levels) often bleed from mucous membranes and have epistaxis, bleeding gums and menorrhagia, as well as perioperative hemorrhage . In patients with severe FVII deficiency (< 2% levels) bleeding into the CNS very early in life leads to a high morbidity and mortality . Congenital FVII deficiency is usually suspected in patients without liver disease who have an isolated prolonged PT but normal aPTT and fibrinogen level . Treatment of choice is recombinant human FVIIa concentrate, but virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma or a plasma-derived FVII concentrate can be used to treat acute bleeds or to cover surgery . Congenital FX deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder; many patients with symptomatic bleeding are homozygous, though a few double heterozygotes have been reported . The differential diagnosis includes acquired FX deficiency resulting from either warfarin therapy or liver disease when it is accompanied by a reduction in the level of other clotting factors . Virally inactivated fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate, which contains FX as well as other vitamin-K-dependent proteins, should be given as an FX replacement . FXI deficiency usually leads to excessive hemorrhage after surgery or trauma; spontaneous bleeds are rare and hemorrhages into joints and muscles are uncommon . The management of bleeding and surgery in patients with FXI deficiency is not straightforward due to the lack of correlation between hemorrhagic potential and plasma FXI level, and the lack of an effective and entirely safe FXI concentrate . Before surgery the postoperative bleeding risk should be assessed based on the patient's hemorrhagic history after previous surgery, FXI level and severity of the impending operation . Treatment with oral vitamin K increases the plasma level of these clotting factors, and fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate are effective for acute bleeds . The severity of the bleeding state is related to the FXIII plasma levels . For surgery the level should be kept above 30%, and this can be accomplished with a virally inactivated plasma-derived FXIII concentrate .","Fibrinogen deficiency Congenital hypofibrinogenemia predisposes to venous thromboembolism, postoperative and postpartum hemorrhage and placental abruption. As fibrinogen has a long half-life of 5 days, effective prophylaxis can be readily achieved for surgery and throughout pregnancy. Factor VII deficiency Bleeding is uncommon in factor (F)VII heterozygotes. Individuals with severe FVII deficiency are usually homozygous and originate from consanguineous marriages. Bleeding is common in patients with severe FVII deficiency; it can be severe, and can include intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment with recombinant human FVIIa is effective and should be given prophylactically. FXI deficiency Family members should be fully investigated for both FXI clotting activity and the mutation(s) in the gene, because compound heterozygotes are common. Unlike hemophilia A, the level of FXI is not a good predictor of bleeding risk. FXI concentrates should be used with caution, because they predispose to arterial and venous thromboembolism. Fresh frozen plasma is often effective therapy, but exposure to normal FXI in plasma or concentrates carries a risk of inhibitor development in those with type 2 disease."
9781910797181,ch01,"Cigarettes as a nicotine delivery system . A puff on a cigarette results in rapid absorption of nicotine into the bloodstream and delivery of a high-concentration 'bolus' of nicotine to the brain by the arterial circulation (Figure 1.1); this process is repeated with every puff . In the UK and the USA, smokers absorb an average 1-2 mg of nicotine from each cigarette . As a drug delivery system, cigarettes are very flexible because smokers can control the intensity and frequency of puffing . This 'fingertip control' of the nicotine dose allows smokers to meet their current need while avoiding the acute adverse effects of too much nicotine . In fact, such reports are misleading: the data are based on artificial measurements by smoking machines and do not mirror the actual delivery to a smoker . It is possible to extract as much tar and nicotine from these cigarettes as from higher-tar brands by more intensive puffing and by blocking the ventilation holes in the filter that would otherwise dilute the smoke - and that is exactly what smokers usually do . Each smoker appears to have a preferred level of nicotine intake and will adjust the way he or she smokes to achieve that level . It also appears that if cigarette consumption drops below a threshold (perhaps around 5 cigarettes per day), or if the cigarettes are designed to limit the potential for compensation (exempli gratia novel cigarettes in which the tobacco actually contains less nicotine), compensation is very limited . Some people think that this must therefore be the period when smokers experience withdrawal symptoms (see Chapter 5) . However, the duration of withdrawal symptoms has nothing to do with this; it is related to how long it takes the body to get used to not having nicotine in the system . Nicotine concentrations in the blood could conceptually be a useful index of dependence, but its short half-life means that a single measure does not give a particularly accurate picture of total intake over a day . Cotinine has a half-life of 14-20 hours, so its concentration in the blood is more stable than that of nicotine and it can be easily measured in saliva, urine or even hair . A daily nicotine intake of 16 mg (approximately 16 cigarettes/day, or one every hour) corresponds on average to a saliva cotinine concentration of 200 ng/mL; a daily nicotine intake of 10 mg generates a saliva cotinine concentration of about 125 ng/mL . These estimations are not the same for urine or blood measurements . Monoamine oxidase inhibitors in cigarette smoke . There is evidence that cigarette smoke contains other psychoactive compounds which some now believe may contribute to its addictive properties . MAOIs reduce the rate at which monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine are broken down and have been found to reduce depressive symptoms . Research is in its early days, but if MAOIs play a role in cigarette addiction, pure nicotine delivery systems may be less addictive, even if they deliver nicotine as rapidly as cigarettes .","Cigarettes deliver a 'bolus' of nicotine to the brain within seconds of each puff. Smokers absorb an average 1-2 mg of nicotine per cigarette (more when cigarettes are smoked more intensively). Cigarettes also deliver tar, containing potent carcinogens, and carbon monoxide. Smokers' intake of tar and nicotine from so-called 'low-tar' cigarettes is not substantially lower than the intake from higher-tar cigarettes. Nicotine is rapidly metabolized and excreted; its concentration in the blood halves every 90-120 minutes. Almost all the nicotine is cleared over a day of abstinence. The nicotine metabolite cotinine is eliminated much more slowly and is present in all body fluids, including saliva and urine; measurement of saliva or urine cotinine content is therefore a useful means of assessing total nicotine intake over the past few days."
9781910797853,chp7,"However, at diagnosis and relapse, patients often present with urgent complications secondary to bone marrow failure or as a result of the treatment of these complications, which require emergency care . As discussed in Chapter 6, patients with leukemia are at high risk of infection as a result of the immune dysfunction caused by the disease itself and cytotoxic treatments . Tumor lysis syndrome may arise spontaneously as a result of the rapid turnover of leukemic cells, but it occurs more frequently in the first few days after chemotherapy is initiated . Tumor lysis syndrome is potentially life-threatening because it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or acute renal failure, and patients may require organ support in an intensive therapy unit . They defined laboratory tumor lysis syndrome as the presence of two or more abnormalities in potassium, phosphate, uric acid or calcium levels . Clinical tumor lysis syndrome is present when patients have one of the laboratory criteria and at least one of the following: seizure, acute renal failure, elevated creatinine levels, cardiac arrhythmia or death . The risk of tumor lysis syndrome is dependent on patient factors as well as disease factors (Table 7.2) . For example, elderly patients with pre-existing renal impairment are at an increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome . With specific regard to leukemia, acute leukemias with high white blood cell (WBC) counts (exempli gratia > 100 x10 /L) are at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome when treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy because of the tumor bulk and rate of turnover . The approach to managing tumor lysis syndrome can be divided into prophylaxis and treatment . As a universal measure, all patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome should be given at least 3 liters of fluid intravenously over 24 hours to maintain good diuresis . The choice of pharmaceutical prophylaxis depends on the patient's risk of tumor lysis syndrome . Tumor lysis syndrome is primarily an issue in patients with acute leukemias . However, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) receiving the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax are also at risk and need careful monitoring when starting this agent . Hyperleukocytosis - a marked elevation in leukemic cells in the peripheral blood - is a frequent finding in patients with both chronic and acute leukemias . In AML, hyperleukocytosis is arbitrarily defined as leukemia cell counts greater than 100 x 10 /L; and it is more common in patients with monocytic subtypes . However, concomitant chemotherapy is required to maintain depletion of the leukemic cells, especially in patients with acute leukemias in whom the blasts reaccumulate in a short time . The use of ATRA and arsenic trioxide in the treatment of APML has been associated with the development of differentiation syndrome, a potentially severe complication that can affect approximately 25% of patients during the induction phase of treatment . Although there is little evidence to support it, prophylactic corticosteroid treatment is commonly used, especially in patients at high risk of differentiation syndrome .","Sepsis should be treated immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics; intravenous fluids and oxygen should be given as needed. The high risk of bleeding in uncontrolled acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) represents a medical emergency. To prevent coagulopathy, anti-leukemic therapy should be initiated as soon as possible alongside meticulous supportive care. Tumor lysis syndrome may arise spontaneously but is more frequent in the early days of chemotherapy, when massive numbers of tumor cells are being destroyed. All patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome should be given intravenous fluids to maintain good diuresis. Both allopurinol and rasburicase can be used as prophylaxis in tumor lysis syndrome depending on the patient's risk level. However, they should not be used together. Hyperleukocytosis is a frequent finding in both chronic and acute leukemias, but leukostasis tends to be more common in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Rapid reductions in white blood cell counts can be achieved with leukapheresis, but concomitant chemotherapy is needed to maintain leukodepletion. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide has led to impressive improvements in survival rates in APML, but their use may be associated with the development of differentiation syndrome. This can be managed with intravenous dexamethasone, 10 mg twice a day. An increased incidence of thromboses in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is probably linked to treatment with regimens containing L -asparaginase. To help reduce the incidence of thromboses, placement of central venous catheters should be avoided during the induction phase of treatment with these regimens."
9781910797495,chp5,"The abnormal innervation and excitation by sympathetic stimulation provide a possible explanation for the abnormal discharges in peripheral nerves that are observed following nerve damage as well as the reactivity of pain to psychological distress . However, all of the above peripheral processes do not explain more central phenomena, such as motor abnormalities in the brain, or response to spinal cord stimulation and epidural clonidine (see pages 88 and) . Sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) refers to a subset of CRPS patients whose pain is relieved (at least on a temporary basis) by a correctly applied sympatholytic intervention . The pain-relieving effects of sympathetic blocks in patients with SMP outlast the conduction block of sympathetic neurons - in a small number of cases producing permanent relief if applied early in the course of CRPS . There is general agreement that CRPS is associated with emotional and behavioral distress, as might be expected when a person suffers from an extremely painful and often disabling condition with an uncertain prospect for helpful treatment, and often stigmatization . As with most patients with neuropathic pain conditions, psychological distress activates the sympathetic system, and this accounts for the worsening of CRPS pain . In the authors' experience, CBT, which helps patients develop coping skills for managing stress in CRPS pain, is a crucial component of treatment and is essential in CRPS of long duration . Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the benefits of calcitonin in patients with CRPS have shown a small effect at best . Two small single-blind RCTs reported a decrease in pain in patients with acute CRPS after treatment with corticosteroids . Three double-blind RCTs reported that patients treated with alendronate intravenously (7.5 mg/day for 3 days) or orally (40 mg/day) had less pain, tenderness and swelling, and improved motion than those receiving placebo; however, the very small sample sizes (n = 20-32) in these studies preclude any firm conclusion that bisphosphonates are useful therapies . Although antidepressants are known to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, only one trial has been conducted in patients with CRPS . In a retrospective case series of patients with severe CRPS who were referred to a tertiary care pain center and were unresponsive to oral pharmacological regimens combined with physical and behavioral strategies, the addition of monitored lidocaine infusions benefited about 40% of cases . A qualitative systematic review of observational studies of this therapy suggests that less than one-third of patients treated by local anesthetic sympathetic blockade obtain full pain relief . Nevertheless, in severe and refractory cases of CRPS a trial of SCS may be reasonable, particularly if any pain relief is paired with behavioral and physical therapies targeted at improving function and potentially reversing neuroplastic and behavioral changes associated with CRPS . Dorsal root ganglion stimulation shows great promise for CRPS in view of its high level of efficacy for pain relief, its ability to target sympathetic and motor affects, and its particular potency in reaching dermatomal areas that are otherwise difficult to reach .","Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) involves abnormalities in sensation, motor and sympathetic function, as well as edema and abnormal sweating, with possible trophic changes. The involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in CRPS is likely, but detailed mechanisms differ among patients and remain unclear. Diagnosis requires the presence of a number of symptoms and signs in the areas of sensory, motor and sympathetic function in the absence of any other condition that might account for the symptoms. Intravenous regional sympathetic blockade with guanethidine or systemic phentolamine lack efficacy. Local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic chain is a default clinical treatment for acute CRPS, but the scarcity of data from randomized controlled trials precludes any firm conclusion regarding its effectiveness. Sympathectomy by surgical division, chemical neurolysis or radiofrequency lesioning should be avoided. Pharmacotherapy largely relies on studies of treatment of other types of neuropathic pain. CRPS warrants a cognitive behavioral and rehabilitation treatment program to improve coping and function. Severe CRPS may benefit from a trial of spinal cord stimulation or lidocaine (lignocaine) infusions and/or dorsal rate ganglion stimulation. New strategies in 'reprogramming the brain' may be able to address the neuroplastic changes that occur with CRPS."
9781908541468,ch_4,"Plasma electrolyte and acid-base disturbances are common clinical problems . Mild hyponatremia (plasma sodium 130-135 mmol/L) is common and affects approximately 15-20% of hospitalized patients . More severe hyponatremia (plasma sodium < 130 mmol/L) is rarer and occurs in less than 1-4% of patients (Table 2.1) . Hyponatremia in conjunction with hypo-osmolality (as is common) causes clinical problems, especially when the plasma sodium concentration falls below 120 mmol/L, and patients usually complain of nausea and malaise . Diagnosis of hypo-osmolar hyponatremia requires careful assessment of extracellular volume and measurement of urinary sodium to determine whether total body sodium is low, normal or high . Particular care must be taken when correcting hyponatremia in premenopausal women, children and those with very low plasma sodium levels (< 120 mmol/L) . A more aggressive correction rate of 2.0 mmol/L/hour may be considered in patients with seizures or severe neurological symptoms attributable to hyponatremia . Hypernatremia (plasma sodium concentration >= 145 mmol/L) is common among hospitalized patients, particularly the elderly . Mild hypernatremia (plasma sodium 150-155 mmol/L) is usually associated with nausea, vomiting, irritability and a depressed sensorium . More severe hypernatremia (plasma sodium > 160 mmol/L) may result in seizures, focal neurological defects, stupor and coma . Hypokalemia (plasma potassium <= 3.5 mmol/L) is one of the most common electrolyte abnormalities in hospitalized patients (Table 2.5) . Severe hypokalemia (plasma potassium < 2.0 mmol/L) can lead to paralysis . Hypokalemia due to excessive loss is the most common cause; renal losses usually occur with the use of diuretics, metabolic acidosis and alkalosis . Treatment of hypokalemia depends on its severity and duration, and the underlying clinical context . Treatment is recommended for patients with a plasma potassium level below 3 mmol/L, regardless of the duration and the clinical context . In normal individuals, mild hypokalemia (plasma potassium 3.0-3.5 mmol/L), particularly if chronic, may not need treatment . Hyperkalemia (plasma potassium > 5.0 mmol/L) is common (see Table 2.5) . The most common renal cause of hyperkalemia is chronic kidney disease (CKD), but this hyperkalemia usually only occurs when the GFR has fallen to less than 10 mL/minute . Immediate treatment with intravenous calcium chloride or calcium gluconate as a cardioprotective agent should be given, followed by steps to reduce the plasma potassium level either by inducing a transcellular shift of potassium from the extracellular to intracellular compartment (insulin/dextrose, salbutamol and treatment of acidosis if present) or by increasing potassium excretion (loop diuretics, sodium polystyrene or calcium resonium, or dialysis) . Since 70% of serum calcium is bound to albumin, the most common cause of hypocalcemia is a low plasma albumin concentration . In general, patients with a calcium level corrected to below 1.75 mmol/L (7 mg/dL) or those with tetany, seizures and/or ECG abnormalities should be treated . Symptomatic patients with a serum calcium level of 3.25 mmol/L (13 mg/dL) or more require urgent treatment, initially hydration with normal saline and diuretic therapy with furosemide . The treatment of metabolic acidosis depends on the underlying cause and the severity of manifestations .","Electrolyte disturbances are very common and often iatrogenic. All electrolye disturbances require an accurate assessment of fluid balance. Intake and excretion of solutes, and drugs, must be considered when trying to identify causes. Correction should generally be cautious."
9781908541468,ch_11,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the presence of bacteria and white cells in the urine, together with symptoms; significant bacteriuria is defined as a urine culture yielding more than 10 colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria per mL of urine . Other risk factors include bladder outlet obstruction (exempli gratia from kidney stones or benign prostatic hypertrophy), conditions that cause incomplete bladder emptying (exempli gratia spinal cord injury) and congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract (exempli gratia vesicoureteral reflux) . The diagnosis of UTI requires a good history, urinalysis (with a Gram stain if indicated) and a clean-catch urine specimen for culture and sensitivity testing (Table 9.3) . Complicated UTI occurs because of the presence of an underlying anatomic, functional or pharmacological factor that predisposes to persistent or recurrent infection, or treatment failure (Table 9.4) . While traditionally the diagnosis of UTI is based on the presence of significant bacteriuria, one-third or more of symptomatic women with uncomplicated cystitis have less than 10 CFU/mL of urine, and a convincing history with pyuria by dipstick has a high predictive value without the need for urine culture . Up to 20% of young women with acute cystitis develop recurrent UTIs . In contrast, infections caused by different organisms are generally not associated with underlying anatomic abnormalities and do not require further investigation of the genitourinary tract . Women who have more than three recurrences of UTI documented by urine culture within 1 year can be managed by either self-treatment of the acute episode, postcoital prophylaxis (if an association with sexual intercourse is established) or continuous daily prophylaxis (see Table 9.5) . The commonest urologic abnormalities that predispose to UTI are prostatic disease and outlet obstruction (see Chapter 11) and urinary tract instrumentation . A diagnosis of UTI can be made with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity if the patient has symptoms of UTI and bacteriuria of more than 10 CFU/mL of urine . Urethral syndrome occurs in women complaining of recurrent dysuria and frequency, but with sterile urine or low bacterial counts that have not responded to antibiotics . In men, pyelonephritis does not usually occur in the absence of underlying urologic abnormalities, whereas in women it may occur in association with, or as a consequence of, acute cystitis even in the absence of predisposing factors . For patients with more severe symptoms or with evidence of bacteremia, empiric parenteral antibiotic therapy is recommended for at least the first 1-3 days: a third-generation cephalosporin, aztreonam, a broad-spectrum penicillin, a quinolone, an aminoglycoside or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, followed by oral therapy; in this case, treatment should be given for a minimum of 2 weeks . Pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria should be treated with a 3-7-day course of antibiotics (see Table 9.5), and the urine should subsequently be cultured to ensure cure and to avoid relapse . Catheter-associated UTIs account for 40% of all nosocomial infections and are the most common source of Gram-negative bacteremia in hospitalized patients . Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens (see Table 9.5) .","Uncomplicated cystitis in women, diagnosed by history and pyuria, can be treated empirically with short courses of antibiotics. Recurrent cystitis in women may require longer courses of, or prophylactic, antibiotics. Cystitis in men generally requires a formal urologic assessment. Pyelonephritis usually requires intravenous antibiotics as initial treatment."
9781908541796,chapter11,"It can be defined as treatment aimed at alleviating symptoms and complications caused by the underlying cancer (Table 11.1) or its management (see Chapter 10) . Pain can be managed by treating the cause and by using analgesic drugs (Figure 11.1) . Treating lymphoma with chemotherapy may improve pain . Nausea is one of the most debilitating symptoms associated with the treatment of lymphoma with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Treatment of nausea and vomiting includes both drug and non-drug interventions . Non-drug interventions include simple measures, such as avoiding nausea-inducing stimuli (exempli gratia smell of a fungating tumor or certain types of food) . Various classes of drugs have an antiemetic action and some drugs are particularly useful for certain causes of nausea (Table 11.3) . Patients should be reassured that this effect will improve at the end of their treatment although it may take weeks or months . The most common cause of anemia in lymphoma patients is bone-marrow suppression caused by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . However, there is little evidence to support the use of a cut-off and it may be more appropriate to transfuse only when the patient becomes symptomatic . Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) is administered as a subcutaneous injection and directly stimulates the red cell precursors in the bone marrow . It has been shown to reduce red cell requirements and improve quality of life in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . These concluded that for both outpatient chemotherapy and high-dose inpatient regimens, prophylactic oral levofloxacin resulted in a reduction in fever and antibiotic use . Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has also been shown to reduce the incidence of fever, the use of antibiotics and the length of hospital stay during chemotherapy regimens associated with a greater than 20% risk of febrile neutropenia . In addition, G-CSF is an integral part of some chemotherapy regimens such as CHOP-14, which could not be administered without growth factor support . If the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable (high pulse rate, low blood pressure, falling urine output), administer fluid resuscitation and possibly inotropic support, and obtain advice from the intensive care team . The most feared complications of tumor lysis syndrome are abnormal, potentially fatal, cardiac rhythm disturbances due to the high potassium, renal failure due to the deposition of uric acid in the kidneys and convulsions due to abnormal electrolytes . The key to managing tumor lysis syndrome is to recognize patients who are at risk (Table 11.5) and to institute effective preventive measures as follows . For patients at low risk, allopurinol may be given orally; this prevents uric acid production but may increase deposition of other compounds . For patients at high risk, intravenous rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase, which breaks down uric acid into highly soluble products) should be administered to prevent deposition of uric acid in the kidneys . Treatment of established tumor lysis syndrome is aimed at treating the effects of the metabolic derangements . Care needs to be taken if calcium levels are low because administering calcium may lead to increased calcium phosphate deposition, which may worsen renal failure .","Supportive care is aimed at managing the complications of treatment for lymphoma or of the lymphoma itself. Effective supportive care involves a multidisciplinary and holistic approach, with consideration of psychosocial and physical factors. Effective analgesia and antiemesis has revolutionized supportive care, but fatigue remains debilitating, common and hard to manage. Bone-marrow suppression is a common complication of lymphoma therapy and results in anemia, a low platelet count with bleeding, and a low white cell count and infection risk. Anemia may be treated with recombinant human erythropoietin or blood transfusions. If sufficiently severe, a low platelet count may be treated with platelet transfusions. The treatment of neutropenic sepsis is a medical emergency and requires prompt assessment by a medical team with rapid administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Tumor lysis syndrome is a serious complication of aggressive lymphomas. Recognizing patients at high risk and implementing effective preventive measures is the mainstay of treatment."
9781910797273,chp7,"Previous reports of postpartum deterioration in MS have not been seen in robust studies, and pregnancy does not appear to affect disease progression . Although there is limited information on the effect of steroid therapy in pregnancy, steroids are generally considered to be relatively safe . While there are limited data, pregnancy registers do not suggest a teratogenic effect or increased rate of spontaneous abortion with interferon beta (IFNbeta) in humans . Similarly, limited data suggest neither an increased risk of spontaneous abortion nor a teratogenic effect of glatiramer acetate . In patients with active relapsing MS, maintenance of glatiramer acetate through pregnancy has been advocated by some groups; the risk-benefit analysis should be assessed and discussed with the individual patient . Prospective follow-up of the small number of patients with MS exposed to the drug during pregnancy has not revealed any significant increase in teratogenicity and the propensity to relapse after cessation of natalizumab increases substantially beyond 3 months . This needs to be discussed with women considering future pregnancies before they start disease-modifying treatment (DMT) . Azathioprine is considered relatively safe in pregnancy, but methotrexate is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion and should be avoided . In patients with clinically or radiologically active disease in the postpartum period, consideration should be given to cessation of breast-feeding and re-institution of DMT . In this regard, it is important to recognize the long period between the first and second episode of MS that is often seen in children who are under 10 years of age at the time of symptom onset . This unique presentation now requires a second relapse or dissemination in space and time (DIS and DIT) to confirm the diagnosis of MS (Table 7.3) . It is important that there is an understanding of the course of the disease, and that children are able to recognize the symptoms of relapse from an early age . Conventional DMTs (IFNbeta and glatiramer acetate) are reported, in small open-label studies, to confer a similar benefit on relapse rate to that observed in adults (see pages 80 -) . Similar side effects are also observed in many of the DMTs as compared with adult-onset MS, although liver dysfunction related to the use of IFNbeta may be more common in children . As in adults, glatiramer acetate can cause self-limiting episodes of flushing and tachycardia in some children, and the patient and their family should be aware of this benign though often frightening side effect . Natalizumab has been reported to be highly effective in small case series of children with aggressive relapsing MS, although in some countries it is not licensed for use in individuals under 18 years of age . Aging also widens the list of differential diagnoses, and the presence of comorbid illnesses in this group affects disability and medical options for treatment . Patients in this age group are rarely considered for clinical trials, so there is sparse evidence available, but the DMTs offered to elderly persons with relapsing MS do not differ substantially from those offered to younger adults with the condition .","Multiple sclerosis does not affect fertility. The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) does not affect MS, and MS does not affect the efficacy of the OCP. Ideally, pregnancy in patients with MS should be planned and managed with both obstetric and neurological input. Pregnancy may result in reduced relapse risk, especially in the third trimester, but does not affect the overall progression of MS. Relapses during pregnancy should be treated on a case-by-case basis with specialist input. Although data are limited, there is no evidence of teratogenicity with interferon beta (IFNbeta), glatiramer acetate or natalizumab therapy. In general, IFNbeta and glatiramer acetate therapy should be stopped before pregnancy is confirmed. In patients with highly active MS, an argument can be made to maintain glatiramer acetate provided the patient is cognizant of the potential risks. Methotrexate and teriflunomide must not be used before conception in male or female patients. Teriflunomide has a long half-life and must be appropriately 'washed out' before conception. There are insufficient data regarding fingolimod and dimethyl fumarate in pregnancy; however, cessation of these therapies before conception is recommended. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in patients with MS who have significant immobility. The ability to breast-feed is not affected unless the patient has significant motor impairment. Disease-modifying therapies should in general not be used when breast-feeding."
9781908541703,ch_8,"On the basis of several carefully controlled studies, including randomized trials in Europe and North America, it is now appreciated that most local or distant metastases present between the routine follow-up intervals . The patient's perceived need for follow-up may mean that visiting her doctor regularly for reassurance (even if it is sometimes proven false) will improve her personal well-being . As neither of these possible benefits has been tested in randomized trials, it would be prudent to explain to the patient that regular follow-up, though offered, is not necessarily of proven value . In fact, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended that follow-up for breast cancer patients should stop after 3 years in England and Wales . From a different perspective, because our understanding of breast cancer is continually changing, it may be important to follow up patients for a long time, not only to continue treatment such as extended adjuvant hormone therapy (see Chapter 6), but to assess and treat the long-term side effects of therapy such as osteoporosis and cognitive dysfunction, and the late side effects of radiotherapy . Clinicians and patients alike need to be reassured that the risk of local relapse within the retained breast is similar to the risk of a contralateral breast cancer, which is about 4% over 10 years . The relative risk of dying from a contralateral breast cancer depends on the recurrence risk associated with the original tumor . Magnetic resonance imaging is often used in the follow-up period for patients whose cancer was initially mammographically occult or for whom the risk of a relapse or new cancer is considered high . The routine use of tumor markers or imaging tests in the search for distant metastases is not recommended . Patients undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer require rehabilitation to address the physical and psychological consequences of surgery . Breast prostheses are an important aspect of physical rehabilitation after mastectomy, and can also strongly influence psychological rehabilitation . Many hospitals have a nurse or physiotherapist trained in the use of breast prostheses . This initial reaction is, however, transient, and many women experience a period of shock and denial followed by anxiety about 2-3 months after surgery . Approximately 20-30% of women, however, have persistent psychological or sexual problems 1-2 years after surgery, compared with 10% of age-matched women without breast cancer . Patients may also experience anxiety or depression in association with follow-up visits to the clinic, because of the fear that the cancer might recur . If recurrent disease is detected, the patient must again come to terms with the risk of death and the need for further treatment; major depression may occur in up to 50% of women with recurrent disease . Specialist nurse counselors can offer advice and emotional support throughout the processes of diagnosis and treatment, and can identify patients with psychological problems requiring treatment . Volunteer groups, composed of women who have had breast cancer themselves, self-help groups and national cancer charities can also offer valuable help and advice to breast cancer patients and their families (see Useful resources) .","Conventional belief in the need for intensive follow-up after treatment for primary breast cancer is being challenged, but it may have non-measurable benefits to the patient and their doctors and nurses. Attention must be paid to both physical and psychological rehabilitation. Simple physical exercises, initiated early, accelerate and improve rehabilitation. Short- and long-term emotional and spiritual support should not be overlooked."
9781912776207,ch5,"Progress in developing specific treatments for PTCL has been hampered by the rarity of the diseases, the substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity of the subtypes, compounded by insufficient understanding of the molecular pathobiology, and a lack of the definitive clinical trial data from comparative studies that is needed to change practice . CHOP chemotherapy (Table 5.1) became the backbone of treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the basis of large Phase III trials that confirmed activity and survival benefit compared with historic regimens . However, these trials mostly included patients with aggressive B-cell malignancies, and the superiority of CHOP over alternative chemotherapy regimens in PTCL has never been demonstrated prospectively . In fact, retrospective analysis of cases from the international T-cell Lymphoma Project did not show any survival benefit with anthracycline-based chemotherapy in patients with PTCL . Outcomes with CHOP are unsatisfactory for patients with PTCL: whilst initial complete responses are seen in 40-70% of patients, most develop refractory or relapsed disease, typically within 1-2 years of diagnosis . The only randomized Phase III trial comparing CHOP with an intensive regimen of VIP combined with the ABVD backbone in 88 patients did not show any improvement in survival (5-year event-free survival [EFS]: 32.5% vs 32%) . Retrospective analysis of patients with PTCL treated with several high-grade lymphoma trial protocols found that, in younger patients (< 60 years) with normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, the addition of etoposide, 100 mg/m intravenously on days 1-3, to CHOP (CHOEP) significantly improved EFS (75.4% vs 51%; p = 0.003) . MegaCHOEP (high-dose CHOP and etoposide) did not prevent early progression in a small cohort of younger, fit patients with PTCL treated in German clinical trials, with a complete response rate similar to that reported with standard CHOP, and a 3-year EFS of only 26% . A large randomized Phase III trial (ECHELON-2) in patients with CD30 + PTCL (>= 10%, as assessed by local centers) recently evaluated the benefit of replacing the vincristine in CHOP with brentuximab vedotin, 1.8 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 of each 15-day cycle . CHP + A is likely to become a new standard of care as first-line therapy for this PTCL subgroup but the study was not powered to detect differences in outcome in non-ALCL subtypes . Data suggest that, with the exception of ALK + ALCL, limited-stage PTCL is associated with worse outcomes than limited-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . Outcomes with CHOP chemotherapy are significantly better in ALK + ALCL than in other PTCL subtypes and are akin to those seen in DLBCL . Intensified strategies and consolidation autologous stem cell transplantation are generally reserved for relapsed/refractory disease given potentially favorable clinical outcomes with CHOP-based chemotherapy . EATL and MEITL are both highly aggressive, with very low response rates to CHOP-like chemotherapy - fewer than 10% of patients achieve long-term survival (id est 5 years) . Clinical outcomes were improved compared with historic controls treated with CHOP-like treatment, and this regimen has been adopted by many centers internationally .","Insufficient understanding of the pathology of this heterogeneous group of rare diseases, together with a lack of randomized clinical trial data, has hindered progress in the treatment of PTCL, resulting in wide variation in practice. The use of intensive treatment strategies for nodal PTCL does not appear to improve outcomes. Improved survival with brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP chemotherapy in the ECHELON-2 trial heralded a new treatment standard in ALCL; however, the benefit in other PTCL subtypes is unclear. Extranodal PTCL has a dismal outcome with CHOP-based chemotherapy; alternative therapeutic chemotherapy strategies focused on distinct subtypes are therefore required."
9781910797631,chp3,"Some of these risk factors may be modifiable (exempli gratia social support, employment, abuse, relationships, substance misuse), while others are not (exempli gratia sex, ethnic group, age), and these can affect vulnerability to depression in the light of potentially precipitating events (such as negative life events) . For instance, the World Mental Health (WMH) series of surveys have involved representative samples of people in more than 30 countries; these indicate an average lifetime prevalence for depressive disorder of 10-15% . It appears likely that there may have been increases in the middle years of the 20th century, but detailed reviews conducted for the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project indicate a relatively stable prevalence of depression over the years 1990 to 2010 . Population aging and the increased likelihood of people experiencing chronic medical conditions (which are strongly associated with depression) has affected the proportion of disability attributable to depression, leading to its rising rank as a cause of global disease burden . Studies in Western countries indicate that although older people are more likely to have physical disorders with associated disability, and are more likely to face the loss of partners, friends and family, this age group suffers less from depression than younger people . This sex difference in prevalence is evident across cultures and appears to be independent of marital or employment status; it seems to be related to biological sex differences, to different responses to depression triggers (compared with men, women appear to be more sensitive to interpersonal stressors than to external, goal-oriented factors), and to differing propensities to internalizing disorders (such as anxiety and depression) rather than externalizing disorders (such as substance misuse and antisocial personality) . The most recent UK surveys found higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders in South Asian women, and the greatest sex differential in the prevalence of common mental disorder was in this ethnic group, with a threefold increased risk in women . Population studies in the USA have generally found that non-Hispanic white people have an elevated prevalence of depression compared with African-American and Hispanic people, after controlling for the array of confounding and potentially interacting factors that are linked to ethnic grouping, such as unemployment, income and social class, lone parent status, health insurance coverage, carer roles, chronic disease and disability, and perceived and actual social support . Experiencing subthreshold symptoms of depression also increases the risk of developing depression that meets full diagnostic criteria, although cohort studies have indicated that the risk of progression to major depression is highest among people who have persistent depressive disorder . A high level of concurrence of these disorders has been consistently identified by surveys in many countries, with combined mood and anxiety conditions often more prevalent than 'pure' mood disorder in community samples of working age and older people . Subthreshold depression as well as major depression is associated with functional impairment and increased mortality, and together with the risk of suicide - which is highest among older people - underlines the fact that mood disorders are potentially fatal diseases .","Depression is a common mental disorder, affecting around 5% of the population over a 12-month period, with 10-15% of people likely to experience depression over the course of their lifetime. Women are nearly twice as likely to experience depression as men, and depression more commonly affects people who are divorced or separated, or who have experienced violence or abuse, as well as those experiencing socioeconomic adversity. In high- and middle-income countries, depression is the leading cause of disability and, primarily due to changes in demographic and disease distribution patterns, its contribution to global disability is projected to increase over future decades. Depression is related to a range of biological, sociocultural and psychological factors, and although there are strong links between adversity and its onset, these factors are not necessarily predictive of depression for individuals. At least half of all people affected by depression experience more than a single episode, and the risk of recurrence increases with each successive episode."
9781908541468,ch_13,"Urinary tract obstruction and tumors . Urinary tract obstruction is a relatively common cause of community-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI) (10% of cases) with an incidence of 23 cases per million population . Urinary tract obstruction has a bimodal age distribution, and is common in children and the elderly (> 60 years of age) . In children, congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract are particularly common, and include pelviureteric junction obstruction and vesicoureteric junction obstruction, such as an ectopic ureter, ureterocele or posterior urethral valves . Urinary tract obstruction can be classified according to cause (congenital versus acquired), duration (acute versus chronic), degree (partial versus complete) and location (upper versus lower urinary tract) . Three main points of physiological narrowing of the urinary tract present a high risk for obstruction: the pelviureteric junction, the crossing of the ureter over the common iliac vessels at the pelvic brim and the vesicoureteric junction (Figure 11.1) . Short-term complete infravesical obstruction is invariably associated with AKI together with an enlarged bladder, hydroureter and hydronephrosis . Long-term complete infravesical obstruction may result in AKI or subacute kidney failure coupled with structural changes that are often irreversible . The level of obstruction and its duration governs the clinical presentation of urinary tract obstruction (Table 11.2) . If the obstruction is complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI) then symptoms associated with the infection are also usually present (see Chapter 9) . Urinary tract obstruction should be sought in any individual who presents with kidney failure of unknown cause . Sudden onset of complete anuria is highly suggestive of urinary tract obstruction, and ultrasound examination is the preferred diagnostic investigation . A large postvoid bladder indicates urinary retention, often as a result of prostatic enlargement, whereas an empty bladder with dilatation of the distal ureters suggests obstruction at the bladder inlet . Therefore, it is essential to examine the entire urinary tract when hydronephrosis is present . Tumors of the urinary tract can involve the kidney, ureters, bladder, prostate or urethra . There are broadly four categories of benign kidney tumor: mesenchymal, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal, renal cell, and metanephric (Table 11.4) . Nearly 80% of patients with tuberous sclerosis will ultimately develop AMLs; these are typically multicentric and usually affect both kidneys . Solitary AMLs may become very large and lead to pain, progressive kidney failure and hemorrhage within the tumor mass . Oncocytomas account for approximately 5% of all adult primary renal epithelial neoplasms and 5-15% of surgically resected renal tumors . Papillary adenomas are the most common renal epithelial tumor, often incidentally discovered at postmortem examination . Papillary adenomas are commonly found in elderly patients with acquired renal cystic disease, in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis and in children with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome . Risk factors for renal cell carcinoma include smoking, obesity, acetaminophen (paracetamol) use, gasoline exposure, kidney stones and von Hippel-Lindau disease (approximately 30-50% of all patients) . These tumors present early with hematuria or obstruction, and are often associated with similar tumors in the ureters and bladder .","Urinary tract obstruction is common and can lead to irreversible kidney failure if not recognized. An infected obstructed urinary system is a urologic emergency. Renal cell carcinoma often presents late, while transitional cell carcinoma of the kidney pelvis causes obstruction and presents early. Targeted therapies are expanding the treatment options for both benign and malignant kidney tumors."

As the field of digital medicine, and indeed medicine as a whole, advances a process for the creation and promotion of policies, we need standards to ensure that people are protected from known and unknown harms due to myriad computational and human factors, including both failures of knowledge and failures of intent on the part of developers . Healthcare has seen a proliferation of vulnerabilities, particularly in connected technologies, many of which are life-critical: for example, Johnson and Johnson's insulin pumps, St Jude Medical's implantable cardiac devices, and the WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected 200 000 computers, many of which were part of a critical hospital . White hat hackers, also referred to as security researchers, perform a style of ethical hacking on mission-critical networks and will employ the policies of coordinated disclosure to the network owner if vulnerabilities are found . For instance, MITRE, a non-profit that operates research and development centers sponsored by the federal government, created the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, to identify and catalog vulnerabilities in software or firmware into a free 'dictionary' for organizations to improve their security . Major agencies that are addressing healthcare cybersecurity include the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which has published a number of well-documented methods for quantitatively and qualitatively assessing cyber risks, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has released a number of both premarket and postmarket guidances on cybersecurity best practices . Researchers and developers should not count on others to implement critical basic protections; they should have knowledge of their organization's policies and important contacts, such as the chief information security officer (CISO) . The FDA has been investing more time and guidance around sharing SBOMs in both pre- and postmarket settings, and so have medical device makers like Philips and Siemens, and healthcare providers like NY Presbyterian and the Mayo Clinic . As connected tools increasingly augment clinicians, a critical question emerges: should the manufacturers and adopters of these connected technologies be governed by the symbolic spirit of the Hippocratic Oath? . Inspired by this idea, a number of security researchers from I Am The Cavalry, a grassroots organization with ties to DEF CON, an underground hacking conference, drafted 'The Hippocratic Oath for Connected Medical Devices' (HOCMD) . 24 The FDA has supported further collaboration between security researchers and connected device manufacturers through the agency-led #WeHeartHackers initiative, which launched in early 2019 . Many government agencies support initiatives to improve security for medical connected technologies and healthcare delivery organizations . The mission of the HSCC CWG is to collaborate with HHS and other federal agencies by crafting and promoting the adoption of recommendations and guidance for policy, regulatory and market-driven strategies to facilitate collective mitigation of cybersecurity threats to the sector that affect patient safety, security and privacy and consequently national confidence in the healthcare system .","As advances in technology enable digital tools to gather ever larger amounts of high-resolution personal health information, core principles of medical and research ethics must be integrated at every step, beginning in the design phase.

9781905832729,ch_9,"Nocturnal enuresis is the involuntary passage of urine during sleep in children aged 5 years old and above . Primary nocturnal enuresis is urinary incontinence that occurs during sleep in a child who has never regularly been dry at night . It is often referred to as 'bed-wetting' and is a common condition that can cause difficulty for both child and family . Nocturnal enuresis has a number of different etiologies (Table 8.1) . If nocturnal enuresis persists beyond 9 years of age, the child should undergo an evaluation . The specific gravity of an early-morning urine sample should be measured to identify those who may benefit from antidiuretic hormone (ADH; desmopressin) treatment . vi and Figure 2.3) is one of the most important tools in the investigation and management of primary nocturnal enuresis . It will provide detailed information about fluid intake and voided volumes during the day and episodes of bed-wetting during the night . Urodynamic studies should be reserved for the child with diurnal symptoms that fail to respond to conventional treatments . Many different treatments have been tried for nocturnal enuresis, with varying degrees of success . However, most parents and children ask for treatment because of the inconvenience and social difficulty that bed-wetting causes . If the child wets the bed at a particular time of night, a waking regimen may be of benefit . Behavioral therapy and biofeedback are useful non-pharmacological treatments . ADH (desmopressin) will reduce nocturnal urine output and provide dry nights, but is not recommended for continuous long-term use because of alterations in serum electrolytes, specifically hyponatremia . Only 1% of adolescents (by age 15 years) still experience nocturnal enuresis, and 15% of these become dry with each subsequent year . After the age of 18 years, patients with persistent enuresis due to detrusor overactivity that does not respond to non-surgical treatment could be offered treatment with botulinum toxin or bladder augmentation (see 4 . Nocturia may be associated with the following negative impacts: reduced quality of life and productivity; increased incidence of falls and fractures (particularly among the elderly); mood disturbances; increased daytime fatigue; and decreased alertness . Nocturnal polyuria is a contributory factor in up to 83% of patients with nocturia . vi and Figure 2.3) is the most useful tool for investigating nocturia: it will provide information about the number of night-time voids and fluid intake, particularly in the evening and night . Treatment of nocturia should be on the basis of identified underlying causes . Treatment of sleep apnea can improve nocturia . ADH (desmopressin) has been used successfully to reduce nocturnal urine output . However, it can cause hyponatremia, and there is a risk of exacerbating congestive cardiac failure, particularly in the elderly; some therefore consider it not generally suitable for patients over 65 years of age . A trial of antimuscarinic agent (see Table 4.3) is likely to be beneficial only if the nocturia is associated with significant nocturnal detrusor overactivity .","Primary nocturnal enuresis is urinary incontinence that occurs at night in a child who has never been regularly dry at night. It is a relatively common condition, but generally resolves spontaneously and rarely persists into adolescence. The frequency/volume bladder record is the most useful investigative tool for primary nocturnal enuresis and also helps in monitoring treatment. Treatment of primary nocturnal enuresis is rarely required, but can include modification of fluid intake, behavioral treatments and occasional use of ADH (desmopressin). Nocturia - defined as waking from sleep to void - has a significant impact on quality of life and is a major cause of falls in the elderly. Treatment of nocturia is largely on the basis of the underlying cause. Loop diuretics in the afternoon may be useful if nocturia is related to congestive heart failure. ADH should be used with caution, as it can cause rapid hyponatremia. Antimuscarinics may prove useful only in patients with severe nocturnal detrusor overactivity."
9781912776276,chp3,"In a review of PD non-motor symptoms, an expert panel provided the following list of risk factors for hallucinations only: excessive daytime somnolence, older age at onset of PD, PD duration, depression, PD medications, female sex, dyskinesias and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder . Although hearing loss is common in the age group of most patients with PD, there have been no reports of an association with auditory hallucinations . Of greater interest is the low level of olfactory hallucinations in PDP, since olfactory loss is an early feature of PD; by the time of diagnosis most patients with PD have objectively confirmed reductions in olfaction . The peculiar feature of this risk association is that RBD may pre-date the development of PD motor features by decades, without the development of any psychotic symptoms, hence its presence is likely to signify other parallel processes . Psychotic symptoms, both hallucinations and delusions, are an uncommon side effect of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN), which is seen more often in older patients . In a study of 236 Ashkenazi Jewish patients with PD, evaluated for non-motor symptoms including psychosis, 66 had LRRK2 mutations only, 78 had GBA mutations only, and 12 had both GBA and LRRK2 mutations . Heterozygous mutations in the GBA gene, which encodes the protein beta-glucocerebrosidase, are a major genetic risk factor for PD and DLB . While the precise mechanisms that increase susceptibility to neurodegeneration in GBA carriers are not known, evidence of greater cortical Lewy body pathology, reduced patterns of cortical activation, greater cholinergic deficits and increased synaptic loss in animal models suggest there are potentially important biological pathways linking GBA mutations to changes that may lead to both cognitive impairment and psychosis . Several rare gene mutations have been identified in patients with PD, some of which have been associated with psychotic syndromes . SNCA mutations are associated with a greater prevalence of psychotic symptoms than in non-genetic PD . Cases of psychosis in patients with PD who have PINK1 mutations are rarely reported . One preliminary study in people with DLB or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) with the 5HTTLPR transporter polymorphism suggested an increased risk for delusions but not hallucinations . Other case reports also describe patients with young-onset PD and psychosis with this genetic abnormality, which is usually associated with neuroaxonal dystrophy . This is counterintuitive given that the gene is associated with Alzheimer's disease, which is often concomitant with PDD and DLB, and the dementia confers increased risk of psychotic symptoms . All the medications that treat the motor symptoms of PD are associated with hallucinations, delusions and delirium . Although there are reports of hallucinations in patients with PD before the development of levodopa treatment, it is unclear whether these individuals had postencephalitic parkinsonism or PD, so it is difficult to determine how often psychotic symptoms developed in PD in the pre-levodopa era, or whether they were related to dementia, depression or the use of anticholinergic agents . Anticholinergics, amantadine, levodopa and dopamine agonists may cause PDP when used alone and are thought to be associated with increased risk when used in combination .","The medications commonly prescribed to people with PD can exacerbate or trigger psychosis, particularly visual hallucinations. For this reason, medications should always be reviewed in people developing PD psychosis (PDP). Cumulative anticholinergic load may be important in people on multiple medications. Impaired visual acuity or concurrent eye conditions may increase the risk of visual hallucinations and should be addressed. The study of genetic relationships with PDP is in its infancy and most genetic associations are not yet known. LRRK2, the most common monogenic cause of PD, generally confers a more benign prognosis than GBA -associated PD. People with PD and GBA mutations are at increased risk of dementia and psychosis."
9781912776153,chp8,"Atrial flutter is usually defined as a macro-entrant atrial rhythm (id est a circuit that covers a large area of the atrial myocardium), rotating counterclockwise, occasionally clockwise, within the right atrium (see Figure 1.9) . Typical atrial flutter is defined as cavotricuspid isthmus- (CTI) dependent, whereas atypical flutter includes all other atrial flutters . Typical atrial flutter is a circuit confined to the anterior portion of the right atrium with a 2:1 atrioventricular block (an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute [bpm] and a regular ventricular response of 150 bpm related directly to the atrial rate), and characteristic flutter waves showing a saw-tooth aspect in the inferior leads, and a positive P wave in V1 . The diagnosis of typical or atypical atrial flutter is usually made by reviewing the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing the flutter waves . Patients who have AF may initially present with typical atrial flutter, and only later develop AF . In typical atrial flutter, the circuit is critically dependent on the CTI, an area of slow conduction in the right atrium (see Figure 1.9) . Other types of atrial flutter, referred to as atypical atrial flutter, occur mostly in patients with scarring in the atrium (exempli gratia after radiofrequency ablation or previous heart surgery, or those with structural heart disease) . Atrial flutter characteristically has a saw-tooth appearance of flutter waves on the baseline in the 12-lead ECG (see Figure 1.9) . In common counterclockwise atrial flutter the P waves are inverted in the inferior ECG leads II, III and aVF . Atypical atrial flutter includes all other types of atrial flutter on the 12-lead ECG . A class Ic antiarrhythmic agent such as flecainide or propafenone is generally contraindicated in patients with atrial flutter because of concern about slowing the atrial rate with these potent Ic agents, which slow conduction, and, paradoxically, may allow the ventricular rate to increase . Direct-current cardioversion is highly effective for atrial flutter, requiring generally lower energies than for AF . The same safety features for performing cardioversion for AF apply equally to atrial flutter, mainly consisting of patients being anticoagulated before cardioversion, as well as properly synchronizing the direct-current shock to the R wave . A transesophageal echocardiogram may be required to exclude a left atrial thrombus in cases of non-compliance with a direct oral anticoagulant, or where serial measurements of the international normalized ratio have been subtherapeutic or absent . Radiofrequency (catheter) ablation is recommended as the treatment of choice for CTI-dependent atrial flutter . Radiofrequency ablation creates a line of block in the isthmus region of the right atrium (Figure 8.1) . The procedure can be performed during constant atrial flutter or in sinus rhythm with pacing from the atrium or coronary sinus . After ablation, the prognosis for patients with typical CTI-dependent atrial flutter is excellent . In patients with atypical atrial flutter, recurrences are more common because of scarring of the atria . Up to 30% of patients with either type of atrial flutter develop AF late after a successful flutter ablation and may require further treatment; atrial flutter and AF often coexist .","Ablation for typical atrial flutter is highly successful and low risk, and should be considered first-line treatment. The risk of systemic embolization in atrial flutter should be considered similar to that for atrial fibrillation (AF). Atypical atrial flutter usually includes right atrial flutter circling around regions of scarring, or left atrial flutter following ablation of AF."

Biliary cysts are associated with an increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma . The classic triad of pain, jaundice and an abdominal mass is seen in only 10% of patients and is most common in infants, who may also present with raised bilirubin or failure to thrive . Common symptoms in adults include chronic intermittent abdominal pain, intermittent jaundice and acute cholangitis . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) allows non-invasive preoperative evaluation of the biliary tree . Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is useful for extrahepatic biliary cysts, to delineate the anatomy and to rule out stones or a mass within the dilated duct . Type I/II choledochal cysts are treated with cholecystectomy, resection of the extrahepatic biliary duct and hepaticojejunostomy . Caroli's disease is a congenital condition characterized by multiple segmental dilations of the intrahepatic bile duct . Transabdominal ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or MRCP may be useful in demonstrating the ductal dilations of the intrahepatic biliary system . Oriental cholangiohepatitis, also called recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, is a disease of the biliary tree with multiple pigmented stones, biliary strictures and multiple bouts of cholangitis . The formation of multiple pigmented stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts proximal to biliary strictures results in recurrent cholangitis . Recurrent cholangitis occurs in 44% of patients, abdominal pain in 32% and pancreatitis (due to passage of a common bile duct stone) in 17% . Liver abscess, cirrhosis and rupture of biliary ducts, with fistula formation, may also occur . Surgery may involve cholecystectomy with common bile duct exploration; in a minority of patients (usually those with left hepatic disease), partial hepatic resection may be feasible . AIDS cholangiopathy is a disease syndrome in patients with AIDS that is characterized by biliary obstruction due to strictures caused by opportunistic infections . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography has not been widely evaluated in patients with AIDS cholangiopathy, but may be useful as a diagnostic test . Sphincterotomy may be performed in patients with papillary stenosis and abdominal pain or jaundice . It provides pain relief for 23-70% of patients, but does not change strictures in the biliary tree . In primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), fibrotic strictures occur in the intra- and extrahepatic biliary system with no obvious cause . Patients with PSC have an increased risk for cholangiocarcinoma, estimated at 1% per year . The mean age of presentation is between 40 and 50 years and the disease is more common in men than women . Patients may present with symptoms and signs of end-stage liver disease and portal hypertension . Surgical resection may be an option in patients with significant hepatic fibrosis without cirrhosis; it may involve resection of the extrahepatic biliary tree and hepaticojejunostomy . Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with PSC and end-stage liver disease . In patients without cirrhosis, 5-year survival is longer with surgical treatment (approximately 80%) than with non-surgical endoscopic treatment with sphincterotomy and balloon dilation of strictures (approximately 40%) .","More than 70% of patients with choledochal cysts have an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction.

9781912776818,hh-3,"It has been estimated that the incidence of immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) and cTTP is 2-6 per million, with cTTP accounting for 2-10% of cases in international registries . Immune-mediated TTP . Individuals with iTTP tend to be young women; the median age is 43 years and there is a female predominance of 73% . The major ethnic groups affected by TTP in the UK are white (64%) and African-Caribbean (27%) . The etiology of most iTTP is primarily idiopathic (76%); secondary precipitants include infection, associated autoimmune disease, pregnancy, HIV and, rarely, drugs . Congenital TTP is also an ultra-rare disorder with, in the last 15 years, 73 confirmed cases described in the UK TTP Registry . An additional 123 cases have been identified in the international Hereditary TTP Registry . Individuals from Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa have been enrolled in the international Hereditary TTP Registry, with first disease recognition recorded between birth and 70 years . The Registry has detected 98 different ADAMTS13 mutations (see below) . Immune-mediated TTP results from an acquired deficiency of a cleaving protease for von Willebrand factor (VWF),, now identified as ADAMTS13 . This severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 function can result in the accumulation of ultra-large VWF (UL-VWF) in the plasma, which tethers platelets and results in platelet-rich thrombi within the endothelial surface of the microcirculation (Figure 1.2) . The mechanism of ADAMTS13 deficiency is autoimmune, with autoantibodies (typically immunoglobulin [Ig]G) targeting ADAMTS13 . Antibodies can target different domains of ADAMTS13, but most people have antibodies that bind epitopes in the N-terminal domain . The main mechanism by which autoantibodies contribute to ADAMTS13 deficiency is thought to be direct inhibition of ADAMTS13, but increased clearance of ADAMTS13 also contributes . Congenital TTP . In contrast to iTTP, the mechanism of ADAMTS13 deficiency in cTTP is through mutations within the ADAMTS13 gene itself . ADAMTS13 is located on chromosome 9q34, containing 29 exons and encompassing 1427 amino acids . The mutations are autosomal recessive, with individuals being either homozygous for a mutation (36%) or a compound heterozygote (64%); the main disease-causing mutations are frameshift, missense and nonsense . Mutations have been reported throughout the ADAMTS13 gene . Importantly, in cTTP there is no functional inhibitor of the ADAMTS13 protease . There are typically two peaks seen in clinical presentation: one in childhood, with a median age of 3.5 years; and one in adulthood, which is typically related to pregnancy (median age 31 years) - in individuals who present in adulthood, 69% of cases are associated with pregnancy . The type of mutation identified has been shown to differ between age groups, with pre-spacer domain mutations (see Figure 1.1) leading to earlier symptom development in childhood . The most commonly reported mutation in the UK is rs142572218 (exon 24 R1060W missense mutation), which typically has a later onset of presentation . The international Hereditary TTP Registry found the most common mutation to be rs387906343 (exon 29, c.4143_4144dupA, p . Glu1382ArgfsTer6) have overt disease before 3 months of age compared with carriers of homozygous mutations .","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) exists as immune-mediated (autoimmune) and congenital forms. TTP is mediated by a deficiency of ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor, causing multisystem microthrombi. Congenital TTP has two incidence peaks, first in childhood and then in adulthood, typically in pregnancy."
9781908541703,ch_4,"Although it is possible to make broad generalizations about risk, natural history and clinical pattern, the future for any individual woman (and the occasional man) who develops breast cancer is highly unpredictable . Breast cancer stage appears to be a biological property of the tumor rather than simply an expression of anatomic spread . The natural history of breast cancer is determined by the stage at diagnosis; thus, the risk of recurrence of a stage II tumor is inherently higher than that of a stage I tumor . Although highly aggressive surgical procedures are no better than limited excision for local and systemic management of breast cancer, there is a clear link between local control and overall survival . The subsequent emergence of the ability of the tumor to cross the basement membrane, apparently characterized by the production of specific gene products such as hyaluronidase, heralds invasion and increased risk of systemic disease . The incidence of breast cancer is age related perhaps because multiple defects are involved; the clinical stage and pattern of disease are functions of these defects . More than 95% of breast cancers are epithelial tumors, arising from either the milk-producing glands (lobular carcinomas) or the draining ducts (ductal carcinomas) . As an endocrine-related tumor, breast cancer shares with prostate, thyroid and other rarer epithelial malignancies an enigmatic time-variable history quite distinct from other common epithelial tumors, such as those derived from the colon and lung, with characteristic patterns of long disease-free intervals followed by cyclic recurrence and remission . The treatment guidelines presented in Fast Facts: Breast Cancer have been derived from a classic model of the disease, which is now evolving rapidly . As breast cancer is more fully understood as a systemic regulatory disease with events at the time of surgery critical for outcome, treatment strategies will change, and perhaps the enigma will begin to dissipate . Excision is considered appropriate in older women to avoid the risk of overlooking breast cancer, unless the diagnosis has been confirmed by image-guided core biopsy . Histologically, breast cancers are characterized by groups of abnormal cells in a matrix of normal fibrous tissue . At one extreme, albeit rare, women may present with massive involvement of the axillary nodes or even bone-marrow infiltration and a virtually undetectable primary tumor, and die of breast cancer before the primary disease is clinically apparent . Of particular note is the aggressive nature of breast cancer in very young women; for those under the age of 34 years at diagnosis, fewer than half can be expected to survive 5 years, with most relapsing within the first 3 years after treatment . Accurate clinical staging for breast cancer has always been considered essential as a guide to prognosis and treatment . The individual groups in many staging systems often include too wide a variety of tumors and do not take into account the biology of the tumor (exempli gratia ER, PgR, HER2 receptors or the grade), which appears to have a significant bearing on prognosis and treatment decisions .","Breast cancer is becoming understood as a constantly evolving series of defects in cellular regulation and control. Growth, invasion and metastasis are related but distinct regulatory processes. The mix determines the clinical course in an individual. Most breast lumps are benign, especially those in women younger than 50 years of age. Staging of breast cancer, including examination of lymph nodes, is a prognosis-estimating procedure. Axillary surgery is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic as it achieves local control. New evidence is emerging that the systemic response to the trauma of surgery may induce angiogenesis at the site of latent/occult distant metastases. This may well be amenable to perioperative manipulation of the tumor microenvironment. Gene array techniques are bringing modern molecular biology into the clinic."
9783318068207,hh-3,"A codon is a sequence of three DNA or RNA nucleotides that matches a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis . DNA and RNA molecules are written in a language of four nucleotides; meanwhile, the language of proteins includes 20 amino acids . A gene is a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the creation of a gene product, either RNA or protein . Although non-coding DNA does not provide instructions for making proteins, it is essential to the function of cells, particularly the control of gene activity . Such elements provide sites for specialized proteins called transcription factors to bind and either activate or repress the process by which the information from genes is turned into proteins during transcription . Non-coding DNA contains many types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers and insulators (Figure 1.4) . Other regions of non-coding DNA encode specific types of RNA molecules . Other specialized RNA molecules include microRNAs (miRNAs), short lengths of RNA that block the process of protein production, and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are more extended lengths of RNA that have various regulatory functions in gene activity . The remaining genes provide instructions for the development of tRNA and rRNA, which primarily help assemble amino acids into functioning proteins . Mutations range in size and can affect a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome that comprises multiple genes . A missense mutation is a change in one DNA base pair that results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein made by the gene . Instead of substituting one amino acid for another, the altered DNA sequence prematurely signals the cell to stop building a protein - this type of mutation results in a shortened protein that may function wrongly or not at all . A frameshift mutation occurs when the addition or loss of DNA bases changes a gene's reading frame . This type of mutation may alter the function of the resulting protein . A point mutation or substitution is a genetic mutation in which a single nucleotide base is changed, inserted or deleted from a sequence of DNA or RNA . This tumor suppressor protein is a transcription factor that inhibits cell division or survival in response to several stresses . Tumor protein p53 regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair and metabolism changes . RB is a transcriptional regulatory protein encoded by a tumor suppressor gene that was originally recognized by the genetic analysis of retinoblastoma . Activation of the MAPK pathway leads to the transcription of genes that encode proteins involved in regulating essential cellular functions, such as cell growth, proliferation and differentiation . The activation of these transcription factors by ERK leads to the expression of genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation and survival . Tumor-agnostic therapy uses the same drug to treat all cancer types that have the genetic mutation or a specific biomarker that is targeted by a particular drug .","DNA carries the genetic code in the form of sequences of codons; each codon codes for a specific amino acid or a stop signal. Non-coding DNA, which is much more abundant than coding DNA (99% versus 1%), has important functional roles; promoters, silencers, enhancers and insulators are examples of regulatory elements of non-coding DNA. Different types of genetic mutation occur. A mutation may result in the production of a protein with altered functional ability, or it may prevent the protein from being produced. The most frequent genetic alterations associated with cancer include: base substitutions, indels, copy number alterations, and rearrangements. TP53 mutations are the most frequent mutations in patients with cancer. Mutations affect the ability of cellular tumor protein p53 to regulate cell division and survival. Mutations affecting the MAPK signaling pathway are also implicated in cancers. Dysregulation of the pathway results in increased cell division and survival."
9781908541468,ch_10,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is a common inherited multisystem disease in which patients develop multiple bilateral kidney cysts, cysts in other organs and non-cystic renal manifestations (Figure 8.1) . Most patients (85-90%) have a mutation in the PKD1 gene, which encodes the protein polycystin . Mutations in a second gene, PKD2, can also cause APKD . APKD affects about 1 in 1000 people, making it one of the commonest inherited diseases . It is a common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD); however, progression is slow in most patients, and not inevitable . The absence of cysts in young people does not exclude the diagnosis, because they can form late in life, and screening of asymptomatic individuals is therefore not recommended before the age of 20 years . Genetic diagnosis by mutation analysis or linkage analysis is possible, but not always available, and may require blood samples from family members . Hereditary nephritis is a group of rare genetic disorders that affects 2 in 100 000 people, and accounts for 3% of children and 0.2% of adults with ESKD in developed countries . It is caused by mutations in type IV collagen, which result in structurally defective glomerular (and other) basement membranes . Hereditary nephritis presents with hematuria and proteinuria, causes deafness and ocular changes, and in some individuals progresses to chronic kidney failure (CKD), but with a wide variation in phenotype . mutations in the COL4A5 gene causing X-linked Alport's syndrome (80% of patients) . mutations in either COL4A3 or COL4A4 causing autosomal-recessive disease (15% of patients) . mutations causing autosomal-dominant inheritance (5% of cases) . Males invariably progress to ESKD, while females, despite hematuria, generally maintain kidney function (15% may have CKD) . The absence of hematuria during the first 10 years of life makes it likely that a child will not be affected . About 50% of patients are deaf, males being more commonly affected than females . The differential diagnosis of hereditary nephritis includes various primary and secondary glomerular diseases causing hematuria, especially thin basement membrane disease and immunoglobulin (Ig)A nephropathy, and abnormalities of the urinary tract . The definitive diagnostic test is kidney biopsy with electron microscopy, and immunohistology showing the absence of specific collagen proteins . Genetic analysis is the only reliable way to diagnose the carrier state in asymptomatic female members of affected families and to establish a prenatal diagnosis . Thus, the most common approach still focuses on making a histological diagnosis, followed by screening family members by urinalysis and genetic counseling . Recent work shows that some patients with thin basement membrane lesions have a heterozygous deficiency of either alpha3 or alpha4 type IV collagen chains . Although usually benign, some families show slow progression to CKD . Ultimately, many patients progress to ESKD, requiring dialysis or transplantation . Anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis involving the kidney allograft may occur in a recipient with hereditary nephritis, because an immune response develops to a hitherto unseen type IV collagen antigen; however, this is rare and affects only 3-4% of male transplant recipients .","Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease is a common inherited disease. Liver cysts are the most common extrarenal manifestation. Progression to end-stage kidney disease is slow, and does not occur in all patients. Alport's syndrome is an important but rare cause of hematuria. Deafness and eye abnormalities are common in men with Alport's syndrome."
9781912776207,ch2,"To date, the classification of T-cell lymphomas has been based largely on morphologic assessment, which contrasts with the B-cell lymphomas, for which certain entities are defined by distinct immunophenotypic profiles corresponding to specific maturation stages and recurrent chromosomal translocations . The classification of PTCLs is complicated by the diversity of the entities, a relative lack of pathognomonic molecular markers, and overlapping clinical and pathological features . Significant sinusoidal infiltration in the liver, spleen and bone marrow with medium-sized cytotoxic T cells is a typical feature (Figure 2.8) . CD25 is usually strongly expressed whereas neoplastic cells are negative for ALK and cytotoxic markers . The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of hematopoietic and lymphoid tumors divides PTCLs into nodal, extranodal and leukemic types, each with multiple disease entities (Table 2.1) . PTCL-NOS are predominantly considered to be nodal lymphomas, although extranodal involvement at presentation or relapse is common . The cytology in PTCL-NOS is often pleomorphic (Figure 2.1) - most cases comprise a mixed population of medium to large cells with a high proliferation rate . The expression of pan T-cell antigens (id est those found on all T cells) by malignant cells is highly variable in PTCL-NOS, with reduced or no expression of CD5 and CD7 in up to 80% of cases . The expression of CD52 varies widely (35-100%), and 32-58% of PTCL-NOS cases express CD30 (an activation marker for B and T cells) . Histologically, ALCL is characterized by sheets of pleomorphic cells, typically large anaplastic cells with abundant cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin and variably prominent nucleoli (Figure 2.2) . ALCL is a CD4 + T-cell lymphoma (although rare CD8 + cases have been reported), characterized by strong and robust expression of CD30 in the cell membrane and Golgi bodies, particularly in the larger cells . Cytotoxic markers and CD43 are expressed in most cases but may be absent from ALK − ALCL with DUSP22-IRF4 rearrangement . The malignant T cells in AITL typically express normal Tfh cell markers (CD10, BCL6, PD1, ICOS, CXCL13) and can be highlighted in tissue biopsies using immunohistochemistry antibodies . Recent studies have shown that other PTCL subtypes are also derived from Tfh cells (Figure 2.5) . The molecular signature of Tfh cells is found in about 20% of PTCL-NOS cases, suggesting an overlapping relationship with AITL . Although these cases do not meet the full clinicopathological criteria of AITL, they have some histological findings in common with AITL, express Tfh cell markers and have a similar mutational profile to AITL . Follicular PTCL is a rare subtype with a follicular infiltrate of malignant T cells (Figure 2.6) . Previously considered a morphologic variant of PTCL-NOS, follicular PTCL is now understood to derive from Tfh cells based on a similar gene expression profile . It usually expresses CD8, although CD4 and NK cell markers may be seen rarely . The evolving lymphoma classification systems did not include extranodal natural killer/T cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) as a distinct entity because of early challenges in morphologic and phenotypic characterization .","The PTCLs are a group of highly heterogeneous aggressive malignancies that arise from the transformation of mature post-thymic T cells and natural killer cells. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies PTCLs into nodal, extranodal and leukemia types, each with multiple disease entities. PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) is the most common subtype, reflecting the need for more precise characterization of these lymphomas. Genetic analyses are helping to refine this category further. The primary nodal PTCLs are anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), which may be positive or negative for the fusion protein anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK + /ALK − ), and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Extranodal PTCLs are less common than nodal PTCLs and include enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) and hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL). Classification has been largely based on morphologic assessment, although the 2016 update to the WHO classification incorporated recent advances in the understanding of the cell of origin and the molecular signatures of particular types of PTCL. Genetic lesions are also being identified but few are entity-defining markers."
9781910797631,chp5,"As discussed in Chapter 3, depression is about twice as common among women than men, because of a combination of sociocultural, psychological and biological factors . Without doubt, some women will experience some mood changes in conjunction with the changing hormonal levels of the menstrual cycle (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) and the perimenopause (perimenopausal depression) but such mood changes do not explain the higher prevalence of depression among women; sociocultural and psychological factors are of more relevance in this regard . The status of women in society, their social roles and the economic disparity between women and men are the main sociocultural factors that contribute to the higher rate of depression among women . At a personal level, women are more likely to respond to adversity with depressive symptoms, whereas men are more likely to use 'externalizing' behaviors, such as risk-taking or alcohol or substance misuse . The assessment of depression in women needs to take into account the sociocultural and personal factors that may be contributing to the onset, and more importantly the maintenance, of depression . It is a time when women are at particular risk of developing depression and also experience a high risk (30-40%) of having a postpartum relapse of bipolar disorder . The perinatal period is a time in which women are exposed to a range of biopsychosocial stresses (Table 5.2) that may be sufficient to trigger an episode of depression among vulnerable individuals . Notwithstanding this, it is important that women with depression in pregnancy receive appropriate treatment, as antenatal depression is a predictor of subsequent postnatal depression and can lead to the previously noted poor obstetric outcomes . Many women can have transient symptoms of depression over the perinatal period and overpathologizing them can be as harmful as missing a diagnosis of depression, as it may lead to the application of unnecessary interventions . Non-pharmacological interventions such as cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and interpersonal psychotherapy would be the next step to use, with antidepressants confined to those with moderate to severe depression . However, care needs to be taken if antidepressant medication is indicated, as the risks to the developing fetus need to be balanced against the benefits of treating the depression appropriately (Table 5.3) . Women often do not recognize that they are depressed and may consider difficulties in coping as 'normal', thinking that fatigue, irritability and trouble sleeping are part of being a new mother . This is an ideal opportunity to use the 'Whooley' questions to identify women with postnatal depression (see Table 4.2) . Non-directive counseling, allowing the woman to talk about the problems she may be experiencing, is a recognized and effective first-line treatment approach for postnatal depression . Pharmacological treatment can be considered for women with more severe postnatal depression . Some women with severe postnatal depression, especially if they are agitated or have psychotic symptoms, may require ECT . Depressive symptoms can be distressing, even if they do not reach the criteria for major depression, and non-pharmacological interventions may be of benefit, especially if they also help women to cope with role transitions .","Depression is about twice as common among women as men as a result of sociocultural, psychological and biological factors. Women are at particular risk of developing depression during the perinatal period - the time from conception through to the end of the first postnatal year. Antenatal depression is a predictor of subsequent postnatal depression. There are risks associated with the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy. Only small amounts of the SSRIs pass into breast milk, and breastfeeding is considered safe. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder affects up to 5% of women; its assessment requires the presence of symptoms over a number of menstrual cycles. Some women do not respond to antidepressants during the perimenopause, and the addition of hormone replacement therapy to an antidepressant may help."
9781908541727,ch06,"Gritty, itchy or watery eyes are very common complaints, and in general are annoying to the patient rather than dangerous . Routine referral is appropriate for patients with gritty, itchy or watery eyes if their discomfort persists or worsens . Causes of a gritty eye include a corneal or conjunctival foreign body, corneal ulcers (infective and non-infective corneal ulcers, such as marginal keratitis), corneal abrasions, dry eye, blepharitis, inturned eyelashes, ectropion and entropion . The most common causes of gritty sore eyes are dry eye and blepharitis or a combination of the two . If a patient complains 'there is something in my eye' (foreign body sensation), they may well have a foreign body on the cornea (see Chapter 11) or conjunctiva, or between the upper or lower eyelid and the eyeball . Be aware that a dendritic corneal ulcer, which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), may present as a gritty eye rather than a red painful eye, because the virus makes the cornea partially numb . However, the patient will often complain of blurred vision and will have mildly reduced visual acuity; corneal examination with fluorescein and blue light will usually reveal the typical branch-like ulcer . Dry eye may cause a slightly red eye, or the patient may have normal-looking eyes . Corneal abnormalities caused by dry eye are only visible on slit-lamp examination . Blepharitis is a chronic inflammation of the eyelid margins (often with crusting at the base of the lashes and redness of the lid margins) that can occur at any age . Patients commonly complain of chronic eye irritation, grittiness and itching . Patients with blepharitis are also predisposed to the development of chalazia (eyelid lumps caused by inflammation of the oil glands; see page 85) and marginal keratitis (small peripheral corneal ulcers) . Tears comprise a mucous layer (from the goblet cells of the conjunctiva) that acts as a wetting agent and allows the main watery or aqueous component (from the lacrimal glands) to stick to the surface of the eye . In addition, a superficial oil layer (from the meibomian glands that have openings all along the lid margins behind the lashes) floats on the watery layer and stops it from evaporating . This poor oil layer allows the watery component to evaporate, resulting in a dry eye . This is why patients can sometimes have watery eyes even though the problem is one of dry eye from blepharitis - the poor oil layer allows the watery layer to evaporate quickly, which stimulates excess lacrimal secretions and more aqueous production and hence the watery eye . Eye irritation occurs in ectropion because the outward drooping lid exposes the eye and can also cause watering, while in entropion the inturned lid's lashes abrade the cornea . Eye itch without redness is most commonly due to allergic conjunctivitis; however, mild itching may also be caused by dry eye or blepharitis . Refer routinely if the eye drops don't alleviate the symptoms . The patient complains of constant or intermittent 'tears in the eyes', which sometimes stream down the cheeks and require frequent eye wiping, without eye redness, pain or irritation .","Most patients with gritty, itchy or watery eyes do not need urgent referral, unless serious abnormalities are found when taking a history or on examination. You can treat many patients with these conditions yourself, as described in the chapter. It is important to use a blue light and fluorescein drops to examine the cornea to exclude a corneal ulcer. Occasionally a viral dendritic corneal ulcer will present with a gritty or irritated eye (no pain is felt because the virus makes the eye numb). Always refer these patients urgently to an ophthalmologist and do not prescribe steroid eye drops. Remember to evert the upper eyelid in patients complaining of a 'gritty' feeling or foreign body sensation, to look for a foreign body under the lid."
9781908541468,ch_12,"Kidney stones are a common cause of morbidity in the Western world, affecting 10-20% of the population during their lifetime and leading to hospitalization for 1 in 1000 of the general population each year . The peak age of onset for kidney stone formation is 20-30 years, and the recurrence rate is high - up to 50% within 5 years . Magnesium ammonium phosphate stones (struvite stones) mostly occur in association with an underlying urease-splitting bacterial infection of the urinary tract (exempli gratia Proteus) . Pure uric acid stones usually occur in the context of hyperuricemia among patients with a gouty diathesis or a hematologic malignancy . Uric acid stones have a high recurrence rate . Cystine stones are extremely rare and occur in patients with cystinuria, which is an autosomal defect in the transport of the amino acids cystine, ornithine, lysine and arginine in the kidney and intestine . The most important risk factors for kidney stones are the supersaturation of urine with calcium oxalate and/or uric acid, and the pH of the urine (Table 10.2); however, other underlying risk factors are not completely understood . Urinary infection with a urease-splitting organism is a key factor in struvite stone formation . The major cause of calcium stone formation is excessive urinary excretion of calcium (hypercalciuria), with or without hypercalcemia . Hypercalciuria without hypercalcemia is observed in 60% of patients with calcium stones . The most common type of non-calcareous stones are struvite stones, which are also termed 'infection' stones, because they are usually associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) by a urea-splitting organism . Uric acid stone formation is also critically dependent on the urinary pH . A urinary pH lower than the dissociation constant for uric acid (pH 5.5) and/or the presence of hyperuricosuria play major roles in uric acid stone formation . Chronic diarrheal syndromes, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and jejunoileal bypass surgery are associated with reduced urinary pH and thus a greater propensity for uric acid stone formation . Clinical presentation varies depending on the location, size and number of stones . The most common presentation is renal colic, which is the sudden onset of severe pain caused by the presence of an obstructing kidney or ureteral stone . On the other hand, larger stones may present with painless obstruction or back pain . Stones that reach the ureterovesical junction often present with renal colic accompanied by urgency and frequency . Stones located in the kidney calyces may be completely asymptomatic . Initially, management is directed towards optimal pain control, hydration and urologic consultation for potential removal of an obstructing stone, and subsequently to the underlying predisposing factors and prevention of further episodes . Medical management of a non-obstructing stone requires increasing fluid intake to generate a urine output of more than 2 liters/day, dietary modification and treatment targeted at changing urinary pH (Tables 10.4 and 10.5) . Surgical management depends on the size, location and number of stones (Table 10.6) .","Kidney stones are common and are most often associated with hypercalciuria. Stones can be asymptomatic or cause a variety of clinical problems. Stones may require surgical intervention, but recurrence after surgery is common. High fluid intake and a low-salt and low-oxalate diet are the mainstays of management. Low-calcium diets should be avoided. Thiazide diuretics and potassium citrate are used in some patients."
9781910797495,chp12,"All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and discarded before considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition . As emotional factors often trigger tension or migraine headache, psychosocial assessment for the relationship of stressful events to headache onset and extant stressors or psychiatric comorbidities will be important for risk management and treatment planning . However, it is useful to consider migraine headache and tension headache differently for therapeutic reasons . Further activation of the trigeminal nucleus leads to the characteristic signs of central sensitization usually associated with the clinical picture of full-blown migraine, during which almost any sensory stimulus will worsen the headache . These signs and symptoms include allodynia over the face and head, photophobia and sensitivity to noise or movement, causing patients to want to lie down in a dark, completely quiet room until the headache passes . Tension headache, thought to be due to myofascial pain in the muscles of the head and neck, may be activated by stress and postural factors, or by neural stimuli from an old injury and/or cervical spine disease . Transform headache, often called rebound headache, is caused when the pain-suppressing effects of a short-acting sedative, anxiolytic and/or analgesic wear off so that the manifestations of the sensitized state of the central nervous system (CNS) resumes, often leading to daily headache . Stress is the most common trigger of both migraine ( around 75%) and tension headache, and like all persistent or recurrent pain, the headaches themselves and their effects on function and quality of life can be stressful to patients, their families and their associates . For example, palpation over the occipital nerve can precipitate the pain of occipital neuralgia and trigger points in the neck and trapezius can radiate rostrally causing headache . Signs and symptoms of cervical spine pathology, such as tenderness over upper cervical facet joints may point to a need for imaging of the cervical spine and possible diagnostic medial branch blocks; this could lead to a diagnosis of 'cervicogenic headache' . As emotional factors often trigger tension or migraine headaches, psychosocial assessment for stressors or psychiatric comorbidity is important . Diagnostic testing, particularly brain imaging, may be appropriate to rule out intracerebral causes . It is important to avoid frequent regular dosing (more than twice weekly) of short-acting analgesics or sedatives such as compounds containing butalbital (a short-acting barbiturate often compounded with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or paracetamol [acetaminophen]), to reduce the incidence of transform (rebound) daily headaches . For stress-induced headache, a stress management program, usually delivered in CBT, that trains the patient to avoid and/or manage precipitating stressors and to relax and stretch at onset of headache . Regular and frequent use (more than two to three times weekly) of these and other short-acting sedatives and anxiolytics as well as opioids should be avoided because of the potential for developing transform (rebound) headache, medication dependency or even addiction .","In patients without history of chronic headaches, determine whether an acute new headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition. In chronic headache:- use a headache diary to differentiate headache type and establish pattern of triggers to enable self-management strategies- institute preventive measures such as trigger avoidance, stress control and medication- institute abortive regimen appropriate for headache type- migraine: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress control, triptans- tension/myofascial: NSAIDs, stress control, icing, stretching- avoid regular frequent analgesic use to reduce incidence of transform (rebound) headache physical dependency."
9781908541666,ch_12,"Most commonly seen in young adults, it is the main cause of death in type 1 diabetic patients under the age of 20 years . When DKA occurs in type 2 diabetes, it is the physiological stress caused by the underlying illness that precipitates the acute metabolic decompensation . DKA may occasionally be the presenting manifestation of type 1 diabetes or, more often in patients with established diabetes, it is the consequence of many precipitating factors, of which the most common is infection (accounting for 30-50% of cases; Table 11.1) . DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and metabolic acidosis, which occur as a consequence of insulin deficiency or ineffectiveness, accompanied by increased circulating concentrations of counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon and catecholamines) (Figure 11.1) . Symptoms of DKA develop rapidly, usually within 24 hours, and consist of nausea and vomiting (induced by ketones and contributing to fluid and electrolyte disturbance), thirst and polyuria (Table 11.2) . In all cases the underlying cause of DKA should be sought, with tests that may include, for example, chest radiography, electrocardiography and cultures of blood and urine . Until recently, standard management of DKA focused on reducing blood glucose levels with insulin and intravenous fluids . Once the blood glucose has fallen to about 14 mmol/L (252 mg/dL), saline should be replaced with 5% dextrose (or an infusion of 10% glucose given at 125 mL/hour started alongside the infusion of normal saline to correct circulatory volume) to allow continued insulin administration to suppress ketogenesis while avoiding hypoglycemia . Formerly insulin was infused at a rate of 5-10 units/hour to produce steady-state insulin levels, to inhibit lipolysis and hence ketogenesis and to inhibit hepatic glucose production and enhance disposal of glucose and ketone bodies by peripheral tissues . Insulin therapy and correction of acidosis decreases potassium levels, and most patients will require intravenous potassium supplementation to prevent hypokalemia and replace total body potassium deficit . Once ketoacidosis is resolved, hyperglycemia has been corrected and the patient has improved clinically and is eating and drinking, subcutaneous insulin administration can resume . When a patient presents with DKA, every effort should be made to identify the cause where possible in order to establish strategies to prevent a recurrence . HHS is characterized by severe hyperglycemia, dehydration and hyperosmolarity in the absence of ketonemia/ketonuria and acidosis (Table 11.4) . HHS usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (often undiagnosed) . The absence of ketoacidosis in HHS is not fully explained but may be because such individuals have insulin levels low enough to cause hyperglycemia but adequate to inhibit lipolysis and ketogenesis because of the differential effect of insulin on lipolysis and glucose uptake . HHS occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes in the presence of a concomitant illness that leads to reduced fluid intake . Patients are clinically severely volume-depleted and often there are signs of infection when this is the precipitating cause . Treatment of HHS by fluid, electrolyte and insulin replacement is as for DKA (fluid deficits may be large [exempli gratia 10 L or more]) .","Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes. DKA is characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia and acidosis. Infection is the most common precipitating factor in DKA. Treatment of DKA is by fluid and electrolyte replacement, intravenous insulin and treatment of the underlying cause, when known. The overall mortality of DKA is 3-4%. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) occurs in older patients with type 2 diabetes. HHS is similar to DKA, but without ketosis and acidosis. Treatment of HHS is similar to the treatment of DKA."
9781912776818,hh-6,"TTP was originally characterized by a pentad of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, fluctuating neurological signs, renal impairment and fever . TTP is now defined by MAHA with moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia and associated organ dysfunction (neurological, cardiac, gastrointestinal and renal involvement) without an alternative explanation . The diagnosis is confirmed by an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL . Acute renal failure (requiring hemodialysis) is rare in immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), with a median creatinine level at presentation of 90 µmol/L (1.0 mg/dL) . Significant renal impairment usually points to a diagnosis of HUS . It is a sign of poor prognosis, being associated with a sevenfold increase in mortality rate compared with TTP patients with normal troponin levels . A stool culture can rule out an important differential diagnosis, infection-associated HUS, which is typically associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and may present with bloody diarrhea, TMA and marked renal impairment . A virology screen should be undertaken prior to exposure to plasma products, to exclude HIV and other viral-associated TTP . Once a diagnosis of TTP is suspected, treatment with plasma exchange should be initiated without delay . ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL confirms the diagnosis of TTP . Samples taken immediately following plasma therapy may give a falsely elevated ADAMTS13 activity . However, it has been shown that in more than 78% of cases, samples taken after 3 days of plasma exchange still had an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL . The presence of an inhibitor on mixing studies or anti-ADAMTS13 IgG may help to confirm the diagnosis of iTTP in these situations . A persistent deficiency (< 10 IU/dL) of ADAMTS13 activity, with no evidence of inhibitory autoantibodies, suggests a diagnosis of cTTP . The remainder are secondary TTPs, of which the commonest causes are autoimmune disorders, infection, pregnancy, HIV and drugs (Table 4.2) . Treatment of secondary iTTP can be tailored toward the underlying precipitant: for example, discontinuation of the implicated drug or highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) in HIV-associated TTP . A number of scoring systems have been developed to help predict the likelihood of severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity and differentiate TTP from other TMAs . In conjunction with clinical assessment, it calculates the risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and therefore allows early rapid screening of patients who can benefit from plasma-based therapy . 0-4: low risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . 5: intermediate risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . 6-7: high risk of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency . Internal validation of the scoring system demonstrated that when all three criteria were present, specificity was 98.1% and positive predictive value was 98.7%, minimizing the number of false-positive diagnoses . Although a creatinine level above 150-200 µmol/L (1.70-2.25 mg/dL) and a platelet count above 30 x 10 /L usually exclude a diagnosis of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency,, there are a minority of people with TTP who present with platelet counts above 30 x 10 /L or marked renal impairment . Therefore, the diagnosis of TTP should be definitively confirmed by analysis of ADAMTS13 activity .","Untreated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is associated with a high mortality rate; TTP should be treated as a medical emergency. Plasma exchange should be started without delay in an individual presenting with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in the absence of any other identifiable cause. Immune-mediated TTP is often associated with organ involvement, typically neurological and cardiac. Both are markers of poor prognosis and may identify higher-risk patients. Precipitating factors, such as HIV, autoimmune disease, drugs and pregnancy, should be excluded. Treatment should be tailored toward the underlying cause. Pretreatment samples should be sent for ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels. Plasma exchange should be started immediately afterward. Diagnosis of TTP is defined by an ADAMTS13 activity level below 10 IU/dL. A level of 10 IU/dL or higher is in keeping with atypical (complement-mediated) hemolytic uremic syndrome and other thrombotic microangiopathies. Immune-mediated TTP is confirmed with elevated anti-ADAMTS13 IgG, whereas these antibodies are absent in congenital TTP. Scoring systems such as PLASMIC can be a useful tool for predicting the likelihood of severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity, especially in settings where ADAMTS13 assays are not readily available. However, wherever possible, definitive confirmation of TTP should be based on analysis of ADAMTS13 activity."
9781908541420,ch_7,"Current therapies, particularly inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators, have excellent efficacy in controlling symptoms and preventing asthma exacerbations in nearly all people with asthma . In studies of asthma in the community, asthma symptoms are frequently poorly controlled, but this is most usually due to lack of availability of, or failure to take, recommended asthma controller therapies . For instance in a dose-escalation study using fluticasone dipropionate and salmeterol, only 72% of individuals achieved complete control of symptoms with high-dose inhaled therapy, although most of these had partially controlled asthma symptoms . However, some individuals with asthma suffer from severe symptoms or may have progressive loss of lung function, together with frequent exacerbations despite optimal inhaled therapy . In considering whether a patient has 'refractory asthma' it is important not to escalate treatment without careful consideration of whether it is warranted . The degree to which a patient takes a medication as prescribed is termed 'adherence' and is an important goal of treatment for chronic diseases . Patients perform a 'cost-benefit' analysis as to whether to take prescribed medication, an analysis that includes their beliefs about the benefits of the treatment, its cost to them and the likely outcome of their asthma, and their fears about side effects (Figure 5.1) . For example, mental health issues and homelessness, where access to medication may be difficult and the lifestyle chaotic, will not be conducive to regular treatment use . Once medication is prescribed and acquired, patients then need to use their device effectively . A major part of consultation with a patient who is not successful in achieving good asthma control should be a review of inhaler use and technique, as this can be a significant barrier to effective treatment . So the first step in uncontrolled or poorly controlled asthma is the assessment of medication use and adherence . In some instances measurement of blood corticosteroid levels can be performed, or dose counters used to formally assess adherence to medications where this is in doubt . Any patient who does not respond to moderate doses of inhaled medication should undergo lung function testing to confirm a diagnosis of asthma . For children too young to perform spirometry reliably (usually under 7 years of age), a specialist opinion should be sought if the diagnosis is uncertain, as in children the consequences of unnecessary inhalation of corticosteroids (> 200 µg of HFA-beclometasone or equivalent per day) can be significant . . A very few patients have severe asthma that continues to be unstable despite demonstrated reliable medication use . These patients will often have abnormal lung function and also suffer from frequent exacerbations . In this instance frequent continuous use of oral corticosteroids may be employed to achieve and maintain asthma control . For patients with refractory asthma who have an allergic phenotype the drug omalizumab can be effective in reducing exacerbations and enabling a reduction in corticosteroid dose . Treatment algorithms that use measures of airway inflammation suggest that there are some patients with high symptom burden but little evidence of inflammation: a dose reduction of anti-inflammatory therapies may be considered in this group (Figure 5.2) .",Refractory asthma is characterized by uncontrolled symptoms and/or frequent exacerbations despite maximal inhaled medication including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Refractory asthma is present in less than 5% of people with asthma. The first step in assessing refractory asthma is to assess adherence to current treatment. Before making a diagnosis of refractory asthma other conditions such as COPD and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis should be excluded. Assessment of airway inflammation is a very useful step for guiding treatment in refractory asthma.
9781910797457,chp3,"Historically, most men with clinically significant disease presented with a combination of weight loss, bone pain, lethargy and bladder outflow obstruction, attributable to locally advanced or metastatic disease . More commonly today, early disease is detected incidentally from measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in younger, asymptomatic men; occasionally it is an incidental histological finding following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign obstructive symptoms . Measurement of serum PSA is still the most effective single screening test for early detection of prostate cancer; in fact, it can detect more than twice as many prostate cancers as DRE, and the predictive value is increased further if the measurement is combined (as it always should be) with DRE . A study of prostate cancer prevention, in which all men in the placebo group underwent biopsy, reported a significant incidence of prostate cancer in men with PSA levels between 0.5 and 4 ng/mL and normal DRE (Table 3.4) . As shown by the data in Table 3.4, a significant percentage of men with PSA values below the 95th percentile will harbor prostate cancer . All of these have been proposed in attempts to improve the utility of PSA in the detection of early prostate cancer at a curable stage and to reduce the number of negative transrectal biopsies . Studies have shown that age-specific median PSA values may be more useful than age-specific cut-offs, as young men with a PSA above their age-specific median value but below a biopsy threshold of 2.5 ng/mL have an 8-14-fold increased risk of developing prostate cancer . The use of PCA3 in this setting has a negative predictive value of 90% and has been shown to help reduce the number of biopsies performed in men who have persistently elevated PSA after a first biopsy . The value of PSA screening in men who are asymptomatic for prostate cancer is still highly controversial (Table 3.6) . Non-randomized data show that, since the advent of PSA screening in the USA and Europe, the proportion of men presenting with advanced prostate cancer has decreased, as has prostate cancer mortality . In one randomized study, men with clinically significant prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy had a 56% reduction in the risk of premature death from prostate cancer compared with conservative management . A report on a subset of men in this trial from Gothenburg, Sweden, with a median 14-year follow-up, showed a higher cumulative incidence of prostate cancer among the screened population (Figure 3.6) . A recently updated Cochrane meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials concluded that screening did not result in a statistically significant reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality when all populations of all studies were included (risk ratio 1.0 [0.86-1.17]) (Figure 3.7) . Men with a PSA above 1.0 ng/mL in this age group have also been found to be at higher risk of developing metastatic prostate cancer and it has been suggested that they should be invited for regular PSA tests .","Increasingly, prostate cancer is being diagnosed on the basis of a raised prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and subsequent investigation. PSA-based screening of asymptomatic men is controversial. A baseline PSA at age 40-55 years may assess a man's future risk of developing prostate cancer. More advanced disease can present with symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction, hematuria or ureteric obstruction. Bone metastases may cause bone pain or pathological fracture."
9781908541420,ch_9,"Effective prevention involves identifying and avoiding risk factors and asthma triggers, together with effective patient education and adherence to a medication regimen . Included in the goals of good asthma management is the need to meet patients' goals and expectations as well as those of the health practitioners . Good asthma management means that a partnership should be established between the patient and health professional, with shared treatment goals noted in a jointly written and agreed self-management plan . Identifying the risk factors that trigger asthma attacks and removing the appropriate allergens and irritants from the patient's environment can reduce the frequency of symptoms and hospitalizations for asthma, and the need for medication . Patients with a true allergy will have both a history of symptoms on exposure to an allergen and immunologic evidence of sensitivity, for example a positive skin-prick test or blood-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E test . A pet in the home to which the patient with asthma is allergic is a major risk factor for current asthma symptoms . Early identification of occupational sensitizers and removal of the patient from further exposure are important elements in the management of occupational asthma . It is increasingly evident that effective treatment of rhinitis can assist in the management of asthma . Allergen immunotherapy can also be an effective treatment for severe or refractory allergic rhinitis, and an associated improvement in asthma outcomes has been shown . Specific immunotherapy, aimed at treating the underlying allergy, has been shown to be effective in patients with asthma caused by house dust mite, grass or other pollens, and animal dander . Such treatment may be useful in patients for whom allergen avoidance is not possible or whose symptoms are poorly controlled by conventional medication, or where a single allergen is especially problematic . There is some evidence that immunotherapy can prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis to asthma . This involves the preparation of a detailed management plan (Table 7.2), which is agreed between the patient and the physician, and is tailored to the needs and circumstances of the individual patient . Plans based on symptoms or on measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) have been shown to be equally effective . A zone system, which classifies the level of asthma control according to symptoms and PEF (if available), is a useful feature of management plans . Patients' asthma will not be controlled effectively if they do not adhere to their medication and management plan, yet adherence studies reveal that fewer than 50% of patients take their medication as prescribed . Regular consultations are necessary to give patients an opportunity to talk about their concerns, needs and expectations in relation to their asthma and its treatment . adherence to, and concerns about, medication and the management plan . Once control has been achieved, regular follow-up every 1-6 months is necessary to assess whether the management plan is meeting its objectives . Trained asthma educators may also be used to help patients acquire knowledge about their asthma and to address concerns that prevent use of controller medications .","Preventing asthma attacks is the most effective means of controlling asthma. Identifying risk factors that trigger asthma attacks and removing allergens and irritants from the patient's environment can reduce the frequency of symptoms and hospitalizations for asthma, and decrease the need for medication. Immunotherapy is helpful in some patients when one of the following applies: - specific allergens can be shown to be causative - allergen avoidance is not possible - symptoms are not controlled by conventional medication. A written self-management plan empowers patients to manage their asthma optimally. Failure to respond to treatment may result from non-adherence to the prescribed treatment. Attention must be paid to the patient's ability to take their inhaled therapy correctly. Identifying problems surrounding care and creating a patient partnership with agreed treatment goals can facilitate adherence."
9781908541420,ch_4,"In this study, the prevalence of asthma in populations of children aged 13-14 years and 6-7 years is, on average, 13.7% and 11.6%, respectively . However, in some nations, particularly in high-income countries, prevalence in the 13-14 years age group exceeds 20%, indicating very large regional differences in asthma prevalence (Figure 2.1) . Studies of asthma deaths during this time suggested that a majority were preventable with the best available current treatment, and that factors such as poor access to healthcare may have been partly responsible . Thus, the findings of increased numbers of mast cells and eosinophils in the lavage fluid of children with asthma aged 3-5 years suggest that all the necessary cell and mediator pathways are already in place to express the full disease . Despite several recent large intervention studies, such as the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) and START (Inhaled Steroid Treatment as Regular Therapy in Early Asthma), it is still not clear that early introduction of inhaled corticosteroids at the onset of asthma influences the natural history of the disease or airway remodeling . This T cell defect in the origins of asthma also aligns with the deficiency of primary interferons in the epithelium in response to viral infections and increased risk of atopic sensitization . Wheezing is common in the early years of life and recent studies have enabled the identification of several distinct phenotypes . Viral infections are important triggers of exacerbations in children with atopic asthma and may cooperate with allergen sensitization in the origins of asthma . By the age of 8 years, a significant proportion of children develop bronchial hyperresponsiveness and symptoms of moderate-to-severe asthma, whereas others continue to show mild intermittent asthma . Furthermore, lung function often remains impaired even when clinical signs of asthma have disappeared, and 5-10% of children with mild asthma develop severe asthma later in life . In general, children with mild asthma are likely to have a good prognosis, but those with moderate or severe asthma are more likely to show some degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and to be at risk for the persistence of asthma and progressive decline in lung function throughout life . Although counterintuitive based on the inflammatory concept of asthma, there is no evidence that regular use of powerful inhaled corticosteroids in early life alters the natural history of asthma even though these drugs are highly effective in disease control, and reduce the burden of symptoms and exacerbations . There is evidence that eczema is a major risk for the persistence of childhood asthma into adult life . Prevalence studies reveal that asthma is generally more common in boys until puberty, when more girls develop asthma and the predominance reverses . As the prevalence of asthma in adults is generally lower than in children, it is evident that many children grow out of childhood asthma . It is not known what proportion of patients who develop asthma in adulthood actually had a history of childhood asthma - abnormal lung function or bronchial hyperresponsiveness persists in many patients whose symptoms disappear during childhood .","Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. The highest prevalence is seen in affluent westernized populations. In many countries asthma, along with other allergic disorders, continues to increase in prevalence, especially in children and young adults. Death from asthma reflects poor access to healthcare in many countries. Asthma can occur at any time in life, although it most commonly develops in infancy and childhood. There is evidence that early life events, including those that occur in the womb, may be important in the initiation of childhood asthma in those genetically at risk. Although asthma disappears in 30-50% of children during puberty, it often recurs in adulthood. There is no evidence that regular use of corticosteroids in early life alters the natural history of asthma, though these medications are highly effective in disease control."
9781910797082,ch07,"Patient education is also important before embarking on any form of systemic therapy, particularly as all available treatments are associated with potential short- and long-term side effects . When the decision has been taken to initiate therapy and baseline studies have been completed, many centers give a single 5-mg test dose of methotrexate as a precaution to reduce the risk (albeit very small) of idiosyncratic bone-marrow suppression . In the UK, methotrexate is nearly always given as a single weekly dose; if it proves necessary to split the dose (exempli gratia because of nausea), patients receive two divided doses 12 hours apart . Usual practice is initially to increase the dose by 5 mg weekly, or by 2.5 mg a week in elderly patients or those with relevant pre-existing disease . In patients responsive to methotrexate (up to 50%), an initial improvement is often noted after 4 weeks of therapy, with continued gradual improvement over the next 8-12 weeks . are considering conception, because this drug is a teratogen (men and women should be counseled to avoid conception for at least 3 months after discontinuation of methotrexate therapy) . As with methotrexate therapy, when a reasonable improvement has been achieved, the dose can be reduced slowly . Careful management is required, including dose reduction, specific diet and, if necessary, appropriate drug therapy . This is perhaps of particular concern given recent epidemiological evidence that patients with severe psoriasis are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease . Less dramatic results are seen in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, who often require 4 months of therapy for optimal improvement . If patients remain normotensive and serum creatinine does not increase above 30% of baseline, ciclosporin may be continued effectively for a year or more . Hydroxycarbamide is considered to be a second-line therapy for psoriasis, as improvement is slower than with methotrexate, systemic retinoids or ciclosporin . Provided that the white cell count does not fall below 3 x 10 /mL and the hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelet count are not significantly reduced, the drug may be used as long-term therapy with minimal effects on other blood parameters . Bone-marrow suppression is the most important adverse effect, and regular blood monitoring is essential, particularly given hydroxycarbamide's narrow therapeutic index . This should include baseline measurement of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), as a minority of patients have a low level of this enzyme and should not be treated with 6-tioguanine because of the risk of bone-marrow suppression . Randomized controlled trials have shown fumaric acid therapy to be as effective as methotrexate in chronic plaque psoriasis with a reported mean reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) of 50% over 4 months of treatment, and a 70% reduction in PASI score in 57% of patients who tolerate treatment . While standard systemic therapies (phototherapy, ciclosporin, acitretin and methotrexate) remain first-line treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe disease, the arrival of the biological therapies, either as monotherapy or in combination with standard systemic therapies, has reduced the role of less effective (unlicensed) therapies such as 6-tioguanine and hydroxycarbamide, and combination therapy .","Conventional systemic therapies can be extremely helpful in the short- and long-term management of psoriasis. Side effects of systemic therapies for psoriasis include myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Teratogenicity limits the use of methotrexate and acitretin. Close monitoring and adherence to guidelines are key to minimizing toxicity."
9781912776696,hh-8,"Stopping a Phase III trial early based on the evidence for the primary endpoint may limit the amount of data collected from secondary endpoints and safety, which ultimately may delay, or even prevent, approval for the new treatment . Interim analyses for efficacy have stopping rules that trigger a conclusion of overwhelming efficacy for the experimental treatment . At each interim analysis, a p -value calculation compares the treatment groups for the primary endpoint . This is an example of multiplicity in which repeated significance tests, id est interim analyses in addition to the primary analysis at the end of the study, have the potential to inflate the type I error and thus increase the chances of a false-positive claim (see Chapter 4) . For example, there may be three p -value calculations for two interim analyses and a final analysis, each of which has the potential to be a false positive . O'Brien-Fleming, which is the most common scheme applied to interim analyses, recognizes two key issues . If the p -value in the second interim analysis in Example 5.1 had been 0.02 it would have been statistically significant at a conventional significance level of 0.05 . Another common scheme is Haybittle-Peto, which adjusts the significance levels to 0.001 at each of the interim analyses, again leaving most of the 0.05 for the final analysis . Under this scheme, after two interim analyses the final analysis would be conducted at alpha = 0.049 . Schemes such as the O'Brien-Fleming split result in the correct adjusted significance levels for a predetermined number of sequential analyses that are equally spaced (in Example 5.1, the analyses were planned to take place after the primary endpoint had been reported for 200, 400 and 600 patients) . However, the trial design may be organized in such a way that the analyses are not equally spaced, in which case the adjusted significance levels change . The objective here is to stop the study because it has no real chance of achieving the required level of statistical significance for the primary endpoint(s) if it were to run to completion . The most common approach to futility utilizes the concept of conditional power, id est the probability that the final analysis will be statistically significant given the data observed in the interim analysis . The data are nowhere near the anticipated treatment difference (HR = 0.75), and if this trend were to continue a significant p -value at the end of the trial would be highly unlikely . If conditional power under the current trend is, for example, < 20%, and if the observed trend in each treatment arm continues for the remainder of the study, it can be argued that the trial is not worth continuing as there is such a small probability of a statistically significant result at trial completion . Futility rules based on conditional power are the most common, but there are other approaches . Some trials with low conditional power have been stopped prematurely . It is vitally important that interim analyses for efficacy and/or futility do not cause bias .","Interim analyses assess the data for efficacy or for futility (or both) while the trial is ongoing and data are still accumulating. Interim analyses have predefined stopping rules for overwhelming efficacy of the experimental treatment, or futility if the experimental treatment does not appear to offer any efficacy advantage over the existing treatment (or against placebo). Multiple analyses have the potential to inflate the type I probability error (multiplicity), increasing the chances of false-positive results. The type I error rate (alpha = 0.05) must therefore be divided across the interim analyses for efficacy. In most schemes to divide the alpha, a substantial amount of the 0.05 is left for the final analysis, with the interim analyses for efficacy having very stringent significance levels. There is usually only one interim analysis for futility, relatively early in the trial. The conditional power recalculates the power of the study based on the interim data under either the current trend or the original assumption. The former assumes the data in the interim analysis reflect the truth, whereas the latter assumes the original assumption about the data is correct."
9781910797556,chp1,"There is no standard definition of refractory myasthenia gravis (MG), but studies have generally utilized the criteria shown in Table 1.1 . Several epidemiological studies examining the incidence and prevalence of generalized MG have been performed worldwide over the past few decades, most of which have been conducted in Europe . These studies have reported a wide range in incidence rates (IR) and prevalence rates (PR) . This is most likely attributable to greater awareness and accurate diagnosis of the disease, improvements in diagnostic testing (exempli gratia antibody testing), epidemiological methodology and more effective treatment of the disorder, leading to better long-term survival . These patients, who continue to have symptoms and are at continuing risk of crisis and exacerbation because of an inadequate response to appropriate immunosuppressive therapy, are often referred to as having treatment-refractory MG . The exact prevalence of refractory myasthenia is unknown, but it is estimated to occur in approximately 10-15% of patients with generalized disease . of 128 sequential patients seen in a large tertiary referral center, 19 (14.8%) patients were found to be treatment-refractory . The definition of refractory included those patients who could not lower their immunotherapy without clinical relapse, were not clinically controlled on their immunotherapy regimen, or experienced severe side effects from immunotherapy . This study may have overestimated the true incidence of refractory MG as it was conducted at a large tertiary clinic, where the referral population comprised patients with more active disease . 76 of 512 patients (14.8%) in referral centers in India were classified as having refractory MG - exactly the same incidence as in the study discussed above . Juvenile MG is defined as disease with onset before the age of 18 years and accounts for roughly 10% of all cases of MG . study discussed above, the median age of the refractory group was 36 years versus 60 years in the non-refractory group . Refractory patients were more likely to be female (14 of 19) . study, the age of disease onset in the refractory MG group was significantly lower than in the non-refractory group (median age of 36 years versus 61 years) . While all races and ethnicities are affected by MG, people of African descent have a slightly higher prevalence of the disease, which is particularly true in muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive disease . MuSK antibody-positive disease is also more commonly reported in geographic locations closer to the equator . found that 47% of treatment-refractory patients were MuSK-antibody positive, compared with 2% of non-refractory patients . Despite the high percentage of patients with MuSK antibodies in the refractory group, they were also more likely to have undergone thymectomy and to have had thymoma . found that 36 (47.36%) of the refractory patients had MuSK antibodies . Patients in the refractory group were also more likely to have thymoma, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia . The high incidence of diabetes and dyslipidemia was thought to be secondary to the higher doses of corticosteroids used in the refractory group and highlights some of the risks associated with long-term corticosteroid treatment .","Treatment-refractory MG is defined as disease that inadequately responds, or results in unacceptable adverse reactions, to conventional immunosuppressive treatments, or requires excessive amounts of potentially harmful agents or repeated rescue therapy. Patients with comorbidities that preclude the use of conventional treatments and/or who have frequent myasthenic crises are also considered to have refractory MG. Treatment-refractory myasthenia gravis (MG) is estimated to occur in approximately 10-15% of patients with generalized MG. Compared with non-refractory patients, treatment-refractory patients are more likely to be younger at disease onset, female, thymomatous and muscle receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK)-antibody positive."
9781912776153,chp7,"Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a general term describing any rapid heart rate that originates above the ventricles . Although this can include atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter, as electrophysiology has improved our knowledge of mechanisms, it is now generally accepted that SVTs refer to a reciprocating regular tachycardia involving the atrioventricular (AV) node region in approximately 60% of cases, an accessory pathway in up to 30% of cases, and a discrete atrial substrate in about 10% of cases . The characteristic feature is usually a regular narrow QRS complex on the surface electrocardiogram during symptoms of tachycardia (Figure 7.1) . Termination of a narrow QRS tachycardia after intravenous administration of adenosine is often diagnostic of a tachycardia that involves the AV node (exempli gratia AVNRT) or a tachycardia mediated by an accessory pathway, but it does not exclude an atrial tachycardia . Some atrial tachycardias are adenosine sensitive and may terminate rather than reveal that the AV node is not required for the arrhythmia . These patients do not always have associated symptoms of palpitations and, because of the incessant nature of the tachycardia, they may present with heart failure . If symptoms are infrequent and non-intrusive (exempli gratia less than once or twice a year), and provided the diagnosis is confirmed, no treatment may be indicated and the patient can be reassured . Vagal maneuvers can terminate the arrhythmia by selective slowing of conduction through the AV node (Table 7.1) . As discussed above, these arrhythmias use an accessory pathway (atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia), or in the case of AVNRT a slow pathway, as part of the tachycardia in addition to the AV node (see Chapter 1) . The tachycardia can be terminated by slowing conduction through the AV node and/or the pathway . Flecainide should be avoided in patients with impaired left ventricular (LV) function or clinical heart failure, as the risk of proarrhythmia increases significantly . In these circumstances, an SVT can be converted to a potentially fatal arrhythmia - ventricular tachycardia (which can be incessant) or recurrent ventricular fibrillation . These risks are minimal when LV function is normal, as in the majority of patients with SVTs . Sotalol also has partial beta-blocking actions and should be avoided in patients with asthma . Intravenous administration of adenosine as a rapid bolus via a large vein is standard treatment for acute termination of regular narrow QRS tachycardias and has a high degree of success . None of these drugs alters accessory pathway function, so by blocking the AV node all conduction to the ventricles is likely to occur over the pathway . Infrequently, SVT can degenerate to AF (see Chapter 9), which can cause transmission of a rapid atrial rate to the ventricles, leading to ventricular fibrillation in patients with (overt) pre-excitation . Only beta-blockers and amiodarone have an acceptable safety profile in patients with LV dysfunction; flecainide, propafenone and sotalol must be avoided . Radiofrequency (catheter) ablation (RFA), as described in Chapter 6, is successful in 95% of cases as a first procedure for AVNRT or atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia .","Supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) refer to a reciprocating regular tachycardia involving the atrioventricular (AV) node region, an accessory pathway or a discrete atrial substrate. SVTs usually occur in young, otherwise healthy, adults, but may be seen at any age. Intervention is not usually needed if symptoms are infrequent and non-intrusive, providing a diagnosis of SVT has been confirmed. Where ventricular pre-excitation is present on electrocardiography (exempli gratia patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome), referral for cardiological assessment and risk profiling is strongly recommended. Regular antiarrhythmic therapy is not advised in asymptomatic WPW. In symptomatic patients with WPW syndrome, even if symptoms are minimal, ablation is recommended. Pharmacological treatment is aimed at slowing conduction through the AV node and/or the accessory pathway. First-line treatment is catheter ablation; in the presence of normal ventricular function, antiarrhythmic agents are also considered (flecainide, propafenone or sotalol)."
9781908541086,ch_11,"As mentioned in Chapter 1, the classification of 'eating disorders not otherwise specified' (EDNOS), the third diagnostic category of eating disorders in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), is given to cases that do not fulfill the full criteria for anorexia or bulimia, and is the most frequently given diagnosis for eating disorders . individuals who meet all the criteria for anorexia but despite significant weight loss maintain weight in the normal range . individuals who display combinations of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors but at lower frequencies than those stipulated in the criteria . EDNOS also includes two subsets of disorders that have been defined by specific diagnostic criteria and have received increasing research interest: binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES) . Binge-eating disorder, or non-purging bulimia, is characterized as recurrent episodes of binge eating, accompanied by a sense of distress, and feelings of disgust, depression or guilt, without the subsequent inappropriate compensatory behaviors (purging or non-purging) associated with bulimia . There is increasing consent in the literature to consider BED as its own diagnostic category because of its distinct features, treatment and prognosis compared with bulimia . Compared with anorexia and bulimia, the sex ratio is less uneven, with males making up about 40-50% of EDNOS diagnoses with a BED subcategory . Age of onset for BED is slightly higher than for bulimia, ranging from 17 to 32 years, with a mean of 25 years . BED has an overall better prognosis than bulimia, however, as it responds to a wider range of treatments that target both binge eating and weight reduction . CBT and interpersonal therapy (IPT) have appeared equally effective in reducing binge eating, although they do not lead to clinically significant weight loss . Pharmacotherapy has used anticonvulsant agents such as topiramate, which have been associated with a reduction in both binge eating and weight . The selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram and escitalopram, as well as the antiobesity medication sibutramine, all have appeared superior to placebo for reduction in binge frequency, weight loss and improvement of general illness severity, although long-term studies are still lacking . Binge eating or purging behaviors are generally not associated with this disorder, and these individuals can usually recall what they ate . This syndrome is a combination of an eating, sleep and mood disorder . In young children, problems with eating are called feeding disorders . Feeding disorder of infancy and early childhood is a problem with feeding such that a child does not eat properly, resulting in weight loss or inability to gain adequate weight . This problem must first present under 6 years of age to meet the diagnostic criteria . This problem usually presents in infancy and remits in early childhood . Feeding disorder diagnoses are only given if symptoms last for at least 1 month, cannot be explained by other medical problems and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention .","Eating disorders not otherwise specified is the category of diagnosis given to cases that do not fulfill all DSM-IV criteria for anorexia or bulimia; subtypes of this category include binge-eating disorder (BED) and night-eating syndrome (NES). There is a higher prevalence of BED than anorexia or bulimia in men. The peak age of onset for BED is somewhat later than that for bulimia, and BED has an overall better prognosis. Individuals with NES wake several times throughout the night to eat, consuming over one-third of their total energy intake after their evening meal. Feeding disorders in young children are categorized as feeding disorder of infancy and childhood, rumination disorder or pica."
9781910797426,ch05,"Bile duct cancer or cholangiocarcinoma may arise in the intra- or extrahepatic biliary system . The bifurcation of the hepatic duct (hilum) is the most common site for cholangiocarcinomas (Klatskin tumor) . Cholangiocarcinoma occurs predominantly in patients aged 50-70 years and is more common in men than women . Symptoms and signs include obstructive jaundice, pruritus, right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, fever, acholic (pale) stools, dark urine and hepatomegaly . The serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19.9 are usually elevated; however, they may also indicate other types of tumor, and can be mildly or moderately elevated in benign biliary obstruction . Transabdominal ultrasound indicates the level of biliary obstruction and sometimes the tumor mass itself (Figure 5.2) . Computed tomography will usually show the position and extent of a hilar cholangiocarcinoma along with a dilated intrahepatic biliary system, with a non-dilated extrahepatic biliary tree and a non-dilated gallbladder . A CT scan of a distal bile duct cancer will show dilation of the intra- and extrahepatic biliary systems and the gallbladder . CT scans have limited ability to determine the resectability and extent of a tumor and often need to be supplemented by additional techniques, such as positron-emission tomography (PET), to enhance their accuracy . PET scans have a pooled sensitivity and specificity of over 80%, especially for intrahepatic or hilar cholangiocarcinoma . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may provide supplementary definition of both the tumor and extent of biliary obstruction (Figure 5.3) . Other imaging modalities include endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and laparoscopic ultrasound, which may be useful adjuncts for establishing and defining the location and extent of a tumor . Hilar cholangiocarcinoma is classified according to the Bismuth classification (Figure 5.4; Table 5.2) . A hilar lesion may be treated by local resection but usually requires a partial hepatic resection; in either case a hepaticojejunostomy is required to restore continuity of the biliary-enteric tract . Preoperative stenting for alleviation of biliary obstruction may avoid deterioration of liver function, but increases the risk of cholangitis and other complications following resection, especially in hilar lesions . The method and choice of stent insertion depends on the location of the tumor, local expertise and whether unresectability has been clearly determined at the time of stent insertion . Table 5.3 lists the various bile duct tumors . Biliary papillomatosis presents as tumorous papillary growths of the bile duct epithelium, which are usually diffuse and multiple . Jaundice may occur due to a variety of causes, including direct hepatic involvement or compression of the bile ducts by lymph nodes, as well as tumor-related hemolysis . improved understanding of risk factors and etiopathogenesis, especially for cholangiocarcinoma, which might be induced by chronic biliary inflammation, changing growth factor and proinflammatory cytokine expression patterns . improved imaging for preoperative diagnosis (exempli gratia PET and EUS-FNA) . better selection of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma for liver transplantation . molecular markers for improved preoperative diagnosis, prognostication and treatment selection . bioabsorbable stents for palliation, in addition to other new and improved local treatments, such as photodynamic therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasonography, etc .","Bifurcation of the hepatic duct is the most common site for cholangiocarcinoma. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is the major risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Benign biliary obstruction may increase cancer antigen 19.9 levels. Biliary papillomatosis lesions are diffuse and multiple, with the abnormal biliary epithelium producing a large amount of mucus. Rare tumors include biliary cystadenoma and primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
9783318066241,ch2,"Age at first episode of pancreatitis depends on the etiology: childhood for hereditary AP, fifth decade of life for alcohol-related AP and sixth to eighth decade of life for biliary AP . Idiopathic cases of AP are the next most common (14-17%), followed by cases related to heavy alcohol consumption (14%), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; 12%) and hypertriglyceridemia (HTG; 5-10%), but, again, regional differences are important . AP arises when the passage of biliary stones or sludge through the distal choledochus causes a transient or persistent obstruction of the main pancreatic duct at the level of the common channel or ampulla of Vater . Recurrent AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis are common after a first episode of alcohol-related AP . In one population-based study, more than 40% of patients with a first episode of alcohol-related AP were subsequently readmitted with a primary diagnosis of AP, and progression to chronic pancreatitis was high (28% over a median follow-up of 43 months) . In the same population-based study, almost 50% of patients with alcohol-related AP were also smokers, and an alcoholic etiology and smoking were independent predictors for recurrence . Genetic factors may also predispose alcoholic patients to developing recurrent AP and facilitate progression to chronic pancreatitis . Genetic mutations may be a primary cause of acute and chronic pancreatitis, or may be important cofactors together with other genetic mutations and environmental factors such as alcohol and smoking . Most described mutations associated with AP affect the digestive protease/antiprotease system . Genetic mutations affecting trypsinogen, SPINK1 or CTRC can cause a shift towards intrapancreatic autoactivation of trypsinogen, resulting in a predisposition to acute or chronic pancreatitis . In that landmark paper, Whitcomb described an Arg-His substitution at residue 117 of the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1), which was associated with hereditary pancreatitis . PRSS1 mutations cause an autosomal dominant form of hereditary pancreatitis . Patients with hereditary pancreatitis due to PRSS1 mutations have an increased risk of pancreatitis during childhood, quick progression to chronic pancreatitis and a high probability of developing pancreatic cancer . PRSS1 mutations are very uncommon, and should be suspected in idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis starting in childhood (median age 10 years) . The SPINK1 c.101A>G (also called N34S) variant represents the most frequently identified genetic risk factor for idiopathic chronic pancreatitis . Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in CTRC result in a 2.5- to 10-fold increased risk of developing pancreatitis . Compound heterozygosis involving a mutation of both CTRC and SPINK1 has also been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis . While cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, certain homozygous or heterozygous mutations in the CFTR gene may be associated with pancreatitis . These mutations may be associated with deficient hydration and thus increased viscosity of pancreatic juice, thereby reducing its flow . This reduction in flow may result in the progressive depletion of SPINK1 until autoactivation of trypsinogen ultimately causes pancreatic damage . Some patients may have interactions between mutations in CFTR, SPINK1 and /or CTRC .","Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a frequent cause of hospital admission and its incidence has been increasing in recent decades. Gallstones are the leading cause of AP in most countries, followed by alcohol. Hypertriglyceridemia and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are also common causes. Mutation in the PRSS1 gene is a rare cause of AP, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Other genetic mutations are generally considered as cofactors in the development of AP. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma must be ruled out in patients without an evident cause of AP who are aged more than 50 years, with weight loss and/or a recent diagnosis of diabetes."
9781910797723,chp5,"The most advanced treatments are the immune checkpoint inhibiting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated 4 protein (CTLA-4) . In advanced malignant melanoma, which was incurable in the era of chemotherapy, we are now seeing durable long-term remission in many patients with the use of combination immunotherapies, including in patients with brain metastases . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also recently approved PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors for the treatment of microsatellite unstable tumors following exciting clinical activity, especially in high microsatellite instability (MSI-high) colorectal cancer . Preliminary data suggest that elevated systemic inflammatory markers may identify patients who are less likely to benefit from immunotherapy in the advanced disease setting . Further clarification of this relationship, and determination of the optimal systemic inflammatory marker, may improve patient selection and provide options for future combination therapies . Combination therapies with PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs and CTLA-4-targeted drugs provide greater responses and survival than monotherapies in patients with melanoma, albeit with significantly greater autoimmune toxicities . Clearly, the optimal use of vaccines and other immunotherapies in combination with standard systemic therapies, radiotherapy and surgery needs to be established . Early data from patients with lung cancer suggest that added benefit can be obtained from the combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy . Multiple trials are under way to determine whether there is benefit in adding an immunotherapeutic agent - be it a checkpoint inhibitor, or a vaccine or their combination - to chemotherapy, targeted agents or other systemically delivered anti-cancer therapies . It will be exciting to see if concurrent or prior use of other systemic therapies might increase mutational burden, and thereby improve the response to immunotherapies . Clinical trials are under way to determine the optimal dose and scheduling of radiotherapy to combine with immunotherapies . In preclinical murine models of triple-negative breast cancer, neoadjuvant immunotherapy involving depletion of regulatory T cells reduced rates of metastatic disease and increased numbers of long-term survivors compared with the same treatment given in a postsurgical adjuvant fashion . Similarly, the use of anti-PD-1 therapies in the neoadjuvant setting produced longer survival than adjuvant treatment, albeit without long-term survivors . Some Phase III studies of adjuvant immunotherapy completed in patients with resected melanoma have demonstrated improvements in disease-free survival but long-term survival data are awaited . Similarly, a randomized trial of adjuvant durvalumab versus placebo showed significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer after chemoradiotherapy . The duration of therapy in clinical trials is highly arbitrary: for example, the duration of ipilimumab treatment in patients with melanoma was 4 doses over 3 months in the metastatic setting, and up to 3 years in the adjuvant setting . The toxicities are more severe with the combination of a PD-1/PD-L1 targeted drug and a CTLA-4-inhibiting mAb, and are greater in some tumor types (exempli gratia lung compared with melanoma) . In order to harness the immune system for enhanced anti-tumor response and deliver optimal immunotherapy to every patient, predictive biomarkers and novel combination treatment strategies are urgently needed .","Predictive biomarkers are urgently needed to direct precision immunotherapy. Tumor mutation burden is a promising predictor of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors but requires further study, including the use of non-invasive tools such as plasma-circulating tumor DNA analysis. Predictive biomarkers for immune-related toxicity are also needed. Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy are being explored to see whether responses may be augmented."
9781910797471,ch03,"Cardiomyopathies are cardiac diseases in which the myocardium is a primary target of the pathological processes, characterized by abnormal chamber size and wall thickness or functional contractile dysfunctions . In 'primary cardiomyopathies' the cause is myocardial specific, whereas 'secondary cardiomyopathies' have a pre-existing cardiac (valvular disease, coronary ischemia, congenital heart disease or arrhythmia) or systemic (arterial hypertension, infective, hormonal or metabolic) cause . Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder of the heart muscle, in which a multitude of mutated genes encode compromised proteins of the cardiac sarcomere . The disorder is characterized by an abnormal thickening of the left ventricle (LV septum thickness > 1.5 cm; Figure 3.2), usually in the absence of other conditions that increase ventricular pressure loading (exempli gratia systemic hypertension, aortic valve disease, the athlete's heart) . Although common (∼25% of cases at rest), LV outflow obstruction with resulting mitral valve dysfunction (systolic anterior motion of anterior mitral valve leaflet resulting in varying degrees of mitral regurgitation) is not a consistent feature and the term hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is now generally accepted as the name for this condition . It is an important cause of sudden cardiac death, particularly in the young, and is usually due to a ventricular arrhythmia, or patients may manifest signs of right-sided HF and eventually biventricular failure . Restrictive cardiomyopathies are heterogeneous myocardial diseases with a common clinical picture of progressive symptoms of HF, including dyspnea, fatigue and exercise intolerance and varying degrees of peripheral edema, due to abnormal (restrictive) diastolic filling which results in a marked increase in ventricular end-diastolic pressures . A normal LV thickness differentiates this group from hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (see Figure 3.2); however, advanced stages of some of the diseases (exempli gratia cardiac amyloid) may present with marked LVH . Cardiac amyloidosis is characterized by a primary myocardial infiltration and the vast majority of clinically significant cases are caused by either amyloid light-chain (AL)- or transthyretin-related (ATTR) disease . Mayo Clinic staging allows assessment of the severity of cardiac involvement, prognosis and response to treatment in AL disease . Management of cardiac amyloidosis includes supportive therapy for HF and arrhythmia, and treatment of underlying amyloid disease . Treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis includes disease-specific therapy with oral steroids (and immunosuppressive drugs) and supportive therapy, with HF medications, pacing and an implanted defibrillator in cases of advanced conduction disease, life-threatening arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy with reduced systolic function . Therapy includes management of the underlying cause, the treatment of HF, arrhythmia and thromboembolism, and heart transplantation in selected cases . The endomyocardial biopsy, although diagnostic, is usually performed only in acute cases with severe cardiac dysfunction or recurrent ventricular arrhythmia where suspicion of an immunosuppression responsive process (giant cell [ Figure 3.7 ] or eosinophilic necrotizing myocarditis) is high . Ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and HF . The treatment of patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (caused by infection, drugs, alcohol, arrhythmia etc . Rare causes of structural tricuspid valve regurgitation include endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and trauma .","Ischemic heart disease is the commonest cause of left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (HF). Arterial hypertension is an important cause of new presentation but also a powerful precipitant of acute worsening of existing HF. Aortic valve disease is an important cause of HF. Surgery is the best therapy for suitable candidates; assessment of severity in the context of existing cardiac dysfunction can be challenging, but helps to define individuals who would benefit most from surgery. Surgery is always required for organic mitral valve regurgitation, but if the cause is functional then surgery may not help and may even be deleterious. All patients with a new diagnosis of cardiomyopathy require cardiologic referral. Cardiotoxicity is one of the most serious side effects of cancer therapy; cardiac function must be assessed at baseline and during therapy. Timely detection and treatment of cardiac and non-cardiac factors that may worsen HF, and in some cases preventative measures, constitute an inherent part of modern HF management."

Systemic lymphoma is an uncommon finding (occurring in 3-5% of PCNSL patients) and the need to perform a comprehensive assessment of the systemic extent of disease is controversial . Ideally, all patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL should be treated as part of a clinical trial or referred to an appropriate tertiary care center for evaluation and treatment . Multifocal lesions raise the possibility of metastatic disease, and this may be confounded by the fact that as many as 15% of PCNSL patients have a previous diagnosis of systemic cancer . In contrast to most other primary brain tumors, aggressive resection does not improve survival and may result in neurological deterioration . Corticosteroids may have a potent oncolytic effect in PCNSL, causing tumor cell lysis and radiographic regression in up to 40% of patients . PCNSL is a radiosensitive tumor and whole-brain radiotherapy was the standard treatment for many years . Although microscopic CSF dissemination is common, more extensive craniospinal radiotherapy does not confer additional survival benefit, is associated with significant morbidity, and limits the use of adjuvant chemotherapy . High-dose methotrexate is the single most effective agent in the treatment of PCNSL (Figure 10.1) . Therefore, most treatment regimens incorporate high-dose methotrexate (1-8 g/m) alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, followed by whole-brain radiotherapy . In older patients (>= 60 years), methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone can achieve similar overall survival to that achieved with combined modality treatment . Older patients who defer initial radiotherapy remain responsive to this treatment modality, but are at high risk of developing subsequent neurotoxicity . Delayed neurological toxicity is increasingly recognized in long-term PCNSL survivors who were treated with methotrexate followed by cranial radiotherapy . A diagnosis of delayed neurotoxicity requires exclusion of recurrent PCNSL by neuroimaging and CSF cytology . Delayed treatment-related cerebrovascular disease has been observed in younger patients 7-10 years after completion of therapy . PCNSL occurs in 1.6-9.0% of the HIV-infected population and is the second most common intracranial mass lesion in this group of patients, after toxoplasmosis . The median latency from the time of diagnosis of HIV infection is approximately 5 years, and the development of PCNSL is often associated with the onset of other HIV-related diseases . Although patterns of CNS disease in AIDS patients have been changing, toxoplasmosis and PCNSL remain the most common intracranial lesions . Improved therapeutic options and prolonged survival in HIV-positive patients mandate an aggressive approach to achieving a precise diagnosis for an intracranial lesion . The combined results of thallium-201 SPECT and Epstein-Barr viral DNA testing eliminate the need for a brain biopsy in many patients with AIDS . Patients treated for isolated ocular lymphoma have an 80% risk of developing cerebral involvement as long as 10 years after initial diagnosis . Second, unlike many primary brain tumors, PCNSL is exquisitely responsive to treatment and aggressive management may lead to prolonged remission or cure .","Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is increasing in incidence in the immunocompetent population. The approach to diagnosis and treatment of PCNSL is significantly different from that for other primary brain tumors: - steroids should be avoided prior to obtaining diagnostic tissue - stereotactic biopsy should be used for tissue diagnosis; complete resection is not indicated - optimal treatment includes methotrexate-based chemotherapy, with or without cranial radiotherapy - older patients should be treated with chemotherapy alone to avoid treatment-related dementia. Ideally, all patients with newly diagnosed PCNSL should be treated as part of a clinical trial or referred to an appropriate tertiary care center for evaluation and treatment."
9781912776238,ch7,"'Biosimilar' was the legal name adopted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the first follow-on biologic in 2006, and this same term, along with the five-step regulatory pathway, has been adopted by other national regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . For regulators following the WHO standard European regulatory pathway, biosimilars are approved on the totality of evidence of equivalence gathered from 60 to 100 head-to-head tests between the original reference biologic and the biosimilar over five key 'steps' of evidence (see pages 30-36) . By definition, such drugs that fail to demonstrate equivalence over all five of the WHO/EMA pathway steps are called 'intended-copy' biologics . 'Intended-copy' biologics have arisen as a means of delivering affordable medicines in markets with less stringent regulatory pathways . Without either a biosimilarity exercise or the security of a large-scale Phase III trial in each indication (for extrapolation cannot be approved in the absence of biosimilarity or a pivotal clinical trial), the safety and efficacy of such medicines cannot be predicted . For an idea of scale, 23 intended-copy biologics had been registered as generics in Mexico by 2011; in Russia, 20 epoetins, 53 interferons, 42 monoclonal antibody drugs, 61 insulins, 11 somatropins, 24 filgrastims and 55 heparin versions had been approved to 2015 . While intended-copy biologics are unlikely to be encountered in clinical practice in the EU and USA, it should be borne in mind that such products have been misleadingly identified as biosimilars . This is not to say that intended-copy drugs are bad medicines, just that they are not biosimilars, as understood by the WHO and many regulators . While European experience of more than 50 biosimilars approved over more than a decade confirms the utility of the European regulator pathway, there is no such confirmation of the safety and efficacy of intended-copy biologics in regions such as Asia or South America . The following examples illustrate the problems that can arise with intended-copy biologics that have not been through the regulatory scrutiny of biosimilars . In Thailand, more than a dozen different copies of epoetin alfa were marketed but had not been approved through stringent regulatory procedures such as in the EU and USA . The problem with intended-copy biologics is that they have neither the security of biosimilarity studies nor large volumes of clinical data to predict their safety and efficacy . An intended-copy of rituximab (MabThera) called rituximab-Reditux was approved for use in India in 2007 via an abbreviated pathway, on the basis of a single-arm pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy and safety study in 71 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . There had been expectations that the manufacturer would perform a 1000-patient postauthorization safety and efficacy study of rituximab-Reditux following its launch in 2007 . The comparability statistics are necessarily limited to a case-control study in which 101 patients received exclusively MabThera and 72 received rituximab-Reditux; nevertheless, response, safety and 5-year progression-free and overall survival showed no significant differences between the two products .",'Intended-copy' biologics manufactured in countries with less stringent regulation than the EU and USA may not be true biosimilars and clinical equivalence cannot be assumed. Inaccurate use of terminology has clouded the distinction between biosimilars and intended-copy biologics.
9781908541024,ch_3,"Patients with brain tumors typically develop neurological signs and symptoms over a period of weeks to months . Some will have an abrupt onset of signs and symptoms similar to that seen in patients with a cerebrovascular infarct . Occasionally, however, patients will have signs or symptoms, such as a chronic seizure disorder, for years prior to the diagnosis of a low-grade tumor . Symptoms and signs may result from increased intracranial pressure, tumor invasion, obstructive hydrocephalus, tumor secretions or secondary cerebral ischemia . Initial symptoms are often vague and non-specific (Table 2.1) . Some typical misleading scenarios include a sudden or insidious change in personality or mood that is misdiagnosed as depression but is refractory to therapy, or an unexplained change in a patient's usual headache pattern or the development of new headaches in an atypical age group (young children or older adults) . The various neurological symptoms and signs caused by brain tumors may be generalized, localizing or falsely localizing . Headache is the most common symptom of a brain tumor . Typically, the headache is non-specific and occurs equally in patients with and without increased intracranial pressure . Since headache is also the most common neurological complaint in the general population, it is important to note specific features of a patient's headache, as these can assist the diagnostic evaluation . Features that should increase suspicion of a tumor include . headache accompanied by other neurological symptoms . Although headache is the most common symptom of a brain tumor, many patients do not have a headache . Other generalized signs and symptoms . Transient elevations in intracranial pressure may lead to a variety of confusing neurological features, including headache, visual loss, change in level of consciousness, loss of muscle tone, itching, shivering, yawning and hiccups . The most common localizing sign of a brain tumor is seizure; patients typically have focal seizures with or without secondary generalization . Falsely localizing signs seen with increased intracranial pressure include: cranial nerve I, III, IV, VI or VIII abnormality, ipsilateral hemiparesis and ataxia (Table 2.3) . Seizures occur in about one-third of patients; they are often the initial and only symptom . Up to 20% of adults with new-onset seizures will have an underlying brain tumor . Seizures are more common in low-grade than high-grade tumors . Focal seizures are common in situations where the tumor compresses cortex, especially adjacent to the motor strip . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the gold standard for the imaging of brain tumors . Magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows the measurement of biochemical spectra in a region of interest; certain patterns of change may correlate with tumor histology or grade (Figures 2.1 and 2.2, Table 2.5) . Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine study that provides metabolic tumor imaging . PET scans are clinically useful in guiding stereotactic needle biopsy (Figure 2.3), or differentiating radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor . SPECT may be useful in differentiating tumor from radiation necrosis, and has been used extensively to differentiate between tumor and infection in HIV-positive patients .","Initial symptoms and signs of a brain tumor are often vague or non-specific; many patients will have a normal neurological examination. Headache, the most common symptom of a brain tumor, is also the most common neurological complaint in the general population. Therefore, attention to specific features of a patient's headache should guide the clinician's index of suspicion and diagnostic evaluation. Seizures occur in one-third of patients and any adult with new onset seizures should be evaluated for an underlying brain tumor. Although neuroimaging may suggest a specific diagnosis, tissue should be obtained for pathological review in all patients before instituting any therapy. The only exception to this rule is the patient with a typical infiltrating pontine glioma, where the risks of surgery outweigh the benefit. Ideally, the clinician should review images and pathology information directly with the radiologist and neuropathologist. Improvements in neuroimaging may be most useful in assessing response to newer therapies, particularly targeted molecular strategies that may be cytostatic."
9783318067095,ch3,"It is essential to understand that regulatory agencies like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate medical products (like drugs and diagnostic devices) but not the practice of medical care . However, because medical devices have more predictable effects than a novel chemical might have when introduced into the body, regulators generally pay more attention to technical and design aspects of the product when considering safety . All novel drugs are considered dangerous until proven otherwise, but medical device studies can be adjudicated as posing a non-significant risk based on design criteria . The CDRH is often the point of contact for digital medicine developers who are building digital medical products such as 'software as a medical device' (SaMD) . If Product B says the intended use of this measurement is to make a diagnosis, then it would be considered a 'device' and regulated by the FDA . A better question would be about the intended use of the product (id est is the organization making a medical device claim?) . As tools develop multiple functions (exempli gratia can measure step count, heart rate and tremor and can be tailored to specific populations), these digital measurement technologies may be used for either medical product development or commercial clinical care activities . 'Approved' indicates that the device successfully completed an FDA premarket approval (PMA), which evaluates the safety and effectiveness of Class III high-risk products . A good starting point includes the guidance on General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices, Mobile Medical Applications, SaMD and Clinical and Patient Decision Support (CDS and PDS, respectively) Software . For instance, the Cures Act made clearer distinctions on what is considered a regulated medical device versus a wellness product or a digital technology that is not a 'device' (exempli gratia an electronic health record [EHR]) . In Europe, a working group commissioned by NHS England has developed an 'Evidence Standards Framework for Digital Health Technologies' to make it easier for innovators and regulators to define what 'good' looks like within digital medicine . Put simply, the CDRH is primarily concerned with whether a medical product, including both hardware and software, is safe to use and accurate for measuring what it claims to measure . If the manufacturer of that system does not claim it has a medical use (exempli gratia diagnostic, monitoring), the product will not be regulated by the CDRH . Agencies that evaluate new drugs and biologics, like the CDER and CBER, care about whether the observation being made by a digital tool (concept of interest) is valid for the way it is being used in regulated research (context of use): for example, if the digital tool is being used to measure an endpoint in the clinical trial . The endpoints of these trials ultimately serve as the evidence for the label claims that regulatory agencies allow pharmaceutical companies to use when marketing a drug . Sponsors are now deploying digital tools in Phase I, II and III trials as digital measurements need to be relatively consistent in the early stages of trials to develop the necessary evidence both for internal decision-making and regulatory approval .","Agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulate what manufacturers claim a product can do (rather than what a product actually does), which means that a product can be considered a 'device' (and regulated) or not a device (and not regulated) through only a change in words and no change to hardware or software. Digital measurement tools that are considered a 'device' are regulated by the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). Digital tools that support drug applications (exempli gratia those that capture digital endpoint data) are regulated by the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). Increasingly more manufacturers of digital products are considering the 'de novo' regulatory pathway so they do not have to deal with predicates and can develop an application that better reflects the software's unique characteristics. The regulatory frameworks for digital tools are in flux, and developers should continue to read upcoming guidance, comment on the revisions in the public docket and engage in the process to improve regulatory decision-making."
9781908541963,chapter8,"Some patients will develop complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, portal hypertensive bleeding and/or hepatic encephalopathy . Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis and usually heralds a progressive downhill course . Fluid obtained during paracentesis should be sent for measurement of albumin levels, cell count, cytology and culture (ascites should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside for optimal yield) . Treatment of the underlying liver disease is the optimal treatment of ascites (Table 8.3) but, unfortunately, may not be a practical option . Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) is a safe and effective technique for the rapid treatment of ascites . Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) may help patients with ascites refractory to other treatments . Liver transplantation should be considered for patients with refractory ascites, provided they are otherwise good candidates (see Chapter 12) . Hepatorenal syndrome is a feared complication of cirrhosis, sometimes seen in patients with advanced liver disease and ascites . Esophagogastric varices are present in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis . Not all patients with varices will bleed, but those who do have a poor prognosis . Despite significant advances in treatment of patients who bleed, mortality remains extraordinarily high . The mainstays of prophylactic treatment are non-selective beta-blockers: propranolol (starting dose 20 mg twice daily) or nadolol (40 mg daily) reduce the incidence of bleeding for patients with medium or large esophageal varices . Variceal bleeding is rarely subtle and should be suspected in any patient with gastrointestinal bleeding and a history or evidence of chronic liver disease . Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis with a fluoroquinalone or third-generation cephalosporin has been shown to reduce the risk of infections that commonly follow variceal bleeding, and improves mortality . EVL usually controls active bleeding with few complications and is therefore the preferred procedure . Like EVL, ES is effective in controlling bleeding . ES is often easier to perform in patients who are actively bleeding, but is associated with more complications than EVL . After control of the first episode of bleeding, 3-5 sessions of EVL or ES are performed to obliterate the varices fully . Much attention has been devoted to the use of pharmacological agents for the control of acute variceal bleeding . Somatostatin and terlipressin control bleeding in approximately 75% of patients, but neither drug is available in the USA . Balloon tamponade is effective in controlling bleeding, but an alarming list of associated complications limits its use, and it is currently regarded as a technique of last resort . Hepatic encephalopathy encompasses a spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with established liver disease in the absence of other metabolic or structural brain abnormalities . Constipation, bleeding, a high-protein diet, electrolyte abnormalities, renal insufficiency and infection may precipitate the syndrome . in a patient with advanced liver disease . Renal and electrolyte abnormalities are common in patients with cirrhosis who are taking diuretics, and should be corrected . Rifaximin, a non-absorbed oral antibiotic, is effective in controlling hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients and is usually added at a dose of 550 mg twice daily to therapy with lactulose .","Diagnostic paracentesis is mandatory in any patient with new ascites. Salt restriction and diuretics are effective in most patients with ascites. Repeated large-volume paracentesis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts may be required for refractory cases. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for varices. If these are present, prophylactic treatment with beta-blockers is recommended. Acute variceal bleeding is best treated with endoscopic techniques; however, pharmacotherapy also has a limited role. Hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. Lactulose, rifaximin and correction of precipitating factors are the mainstays of treatment."
9781905832729,ch_10,"This is seen in many patients with neurological bladder dysfunction and is characterized by spontaneous involuntary detrusor contractions, with or without the sensation of urgency, leading to urinary incontinence . Patients with detrusor overactivity and DSD not only experience urinary incontinence but may also develop long-term effects of high intravesical pressures, giving rise to ureteric reflux or obstruction, or both, and resulting in renal damage and failure . Injury or disease that affects the nerve roots or peripheral nerves (spinal trauma, myelomeningocele, pelvic surgery, diabetes mellitus) causes bladder areflexia or acontractility and, as a result, the bladder fails to empty unless voiding is assisted by straining . In patients with such lesions, the external urethral sphincter may fail to relax (isolated distal sphincter obstruction) and may also be weakened, giving rise to stress incontinence . The diagnosis of neuropathic bladder disorders requires an understanding of the underlying neurological abnormality, which will be apparent in most patients . However, some patients will present with the symptoms of a neuropathic bladder but with no overt neurological cause . In this situation, it is important to consider the possibility of an undiagnosed neurological condition such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord lesion, as neuropathic bladder may be the presenting symptom . Patients with acontractile bladders tend to leak urine as a result of retention with overflow or in association with sphincter weakness . Despite these measures, some patients will continue to have problems with DSD and will require catheterization to empty the bladder and prevent the long-term complications associated with the condition . The options for these patients are intermittent self-catheterization, or long-term indwelling catheterization with a urethral or suprapubic catheter . Intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) is useful in any condition in which bladder emptying is impaired in association with adequate outlet resistance . Many patients catheterize themselves on a regular basis throughout the day (and night) to ensure bladder emptying . For self-catheterization to be successful in patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction, the bladder must be able to store urine adequately without leaking, a condition that can be facilitated through the use of antimuscarinic medication (see Table 4.3) . For long-term catheterization, the suprapubic catheter avoids urethral damage, and is more comfortable and better tolerated than a catheter inserted via the urethra . Any indwelling catheter left in place for a long period of time has the potential for significant complications (exempli gratia catheter-associated urinary tract infection [UTI], urethral erosion and bladder stones) . Other problems seen with urethral or suprapubic indwelling catheters include catheter-associated UTIs, bypassing of urine around the catheter, pain and discomfort, bladder stones and hematuria . All patients with spinal cord injury and bladder dysfunction are susceptible to renal damage if the intravesical pressure is not adequately controlled . Most neurological diseases that affect the spinal cord and some that affect the brain will cause bladder dysfunction, which, if untreated, may lead to incontinence . Neuropathic bladder dysfunction (also referred to as neurogenic bladder) can be divided into three types of disorder according to the site of the lesion: suprapontine, suprasacral spinal and peripheral .","Neuropathic bladder dysfunction can be classified according to the site of the lesion as suprapontine, suprasacral spinal or peripheral. Suprapontine lesions are largely associated with Parkinson's disease, dementia and cerebrovascular accident. They usually lead to detrusor overactivity but coordinated sphincter function is preserved. Suprasacral spinal lesions are associated with spinal cord injury, spina bifida and tumors, and interfere with the reflex control of the bladder from higher centers, resulting in detrusor overactivity and detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Increased intravesical pressure can damage the ureters and, ultimately, the kidneys. Peripheral lesions affecting the nerve roots cause bladder areflexia or acontractility, such that the bladder fails to empty without straining. Sphincteric weakness may also contribute to incontinence. Management of detrusor overactivity aims to enable low-pressure storage of urine and bladder emptying without obstruction, achieved by antimuscarinic drugs, injection of botulinum toxin or surgery. Some patients require catheterization to ensure bladder emptying. Options are intermittent self-catheterization, if the bladder can store urine adequately without leaking (often achieved with antimuscarinic drugs), or a urethral or suprapubic indwelling catheter."
9781908541024,ch_7,"Surgery is the best treatment for meningiomas and the goal should be complete resection, whenever possible . Meningiomas that are completely resected are associated with recurrence rates of approximately 3% at 5 years and 20% at 20 years . Usually, approximately 1 cm of dural attachment is removed with the tumor, as there is no distinct margin separating the meningioma from the dura . Meningiomas that involve the cerebral and cerebellar convexities can usually be completely removed . Unfortunately, many meningiomas, including those involving the skull base and cavernous sinus, are not completely resectable, even with the use of new surgical techniques such as subtemporal or transpetrosal approaches for tumors involving the anterior skull base or the petroclival region, respectively . Skull base meningiomas are particularly difficult to manage because they usually invade dura and compress vital blood vessels and cranial nerves . For such tumors located in inaccessible areas, aggressive surgical approaches that are likely to cause considerable and permanent morbidity are now often replaced by limited surgical resection combined with postoperative confocal radiotherapy . Similarly, optic nerve sheath meningiomas cannot be resected without sacrificing vision, and should therefore be treated with stereotactic radiotherapy if they are progressive . Radiotherapy is becoming an increasingly important treatment option for meningiomas after initial subtotal resection or following recurrence . Radiotherapy appears to induce apoptosis in meningioma cells and consequently causes cessation of tumor growth, rather than tumor regression . Despite these concerns, radiotherapy substantially delays time-to-recurrence for patients with meningiomas, with the most encouraging series reporting 10-year progression-free survival rates of 83% in patients who have undergone subtotal resection of benign meningiomas . There are limited therapeutic options for patients with meningiomas that are recurrent or progressive following maximal surgery and radiotherapy . Malignant meningiomas remain resistant to therapy, although a recent report has suggested a possible role for alpha-interferon in patients with such tumors . Meningiomas comprise approximately 20% of all brain tumors, and at least 90% are histologically benign or typical . There are many histological subtypes of benign meningiomas . Malignant meningiomas have frankly malignant histological features, and invade blood vessels and brain . Meningiomas are most frequently diagnosed in patients aged 50-80 years, and affect women 2-3 times as often as men (Table 6.2) . Although most meningiomas are histologically benign, they cause considerable morbidity because they are often not completely resectable, or are progressive or recurrent . Nevertheless, benign meningiomas are associated with a median survival in excess of 10 years with treatment . Because meningiomas are frequently asymptomatic and tend to occur in elderly patients, the decision to treat is often a controversial one . When patients are diagnosed with an asymptomatic meningioma by CT or MRI, a period of observation of up to 1 year is often suggested before a decision is taken to treat the tumor . For patients who have meningiomas that cause persistent neurological deficits, or for patients whose tumors have unusual radiographic features or are causing significant cerebral edema, an immediate intervention is often recommended .","Meningiomas are the most common intracranial neoplasm. Most are low-grade and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic meningiomas may not require specific treatment, and can be observed by serial CT or MRI. Surgery is the principal therapeutic modality for symptomatic meningiomas, but many meningiomas cannot be completely resected because of their location in high-risk areas. Radiotherapy can achieve long-term growth stabilization of recurrent or enlarging meningiomas. There are no effective medical therapies for recurrent or malignant meningiomas."
9781910797495,chp6,"The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends that patients with diabetes and neuropathy should provide a medical history and undergo a neurological examination, as well as a nerve-conduction-velocity study, quantitative sensory testing and quantitative autonomic function testing . Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that maintenance of near-normal blood glucose levels with intensive insulin treatment is the best approach to primary and secondary prevention of late diabetic complications such as DN, the prevalence of which may be reduced by 64% . Antidepressants and anticonvulsants are the medications of choice for neuropathic pain, but side effects are common, and particularly troublesome with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) . Clinical guidelines recommend serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; duloxetine, venlafaxine, milnacipran), gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) or a TCA as a first-line treatment, as medications with these mechanisms are all supported by findings from more than two RCTs . The analgesic benefit of TCAs can be explained by several pharmacological mechanisms: they inhibit the presynaptic uptake of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and serotonin within nociceptive monoamine pathways and thereby augment analgesia; they interact with opioid receptors; and they block sodium channels, which may account for their analgesic effect in topical creams . In older adults, TCAs are used (if at all) with extreme caution, starting at very low doses, because of the increased risk of side effects and toxicity . Treatment of patients with neuropathic pain and cardiovascular disease should begin with anticonvulsants or antidepressants with SNRI properties, such as duloxetine, milnacipran or venlafaxine, given the increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with the use of TCAs . Gabapentin, titrated to 1800-3600 mg/day (lower in older patients and those with renal impairment) usually by dosing three times daily, is also widely used for neuropathic pain . Perhaps because the clinical picture indicates fewer severe adverse events with gabapentin and pregabalin, clinicians have widely adopted these gabapentinoids as first-line agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain . The efficacy of opioids in neuropathic pain is established in RCTs, but their long-term effectiveness and side effects have not been well defined and abuse of prescription drugs is a growing problem, as are unintentional overdoses associated with higher doses or use with sedatives and anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines that also induce respiratory depression . A meta-analysis of RCTs has shown that tramadol, an analgesic with a dual mechanism of action (id est activating both opioid receptors and descending inhibitory pain systems) reduces pain intensity in patients with postherpetic neuralgia and DN at mean doses of 210 mg/day . After acute herpes zoster infection, 2% of patients under 60 years old develop PHN, but this figure progressively increases to about 50% with advancing age . Meta-analyses of RCTs have indicated that aciclovir (acyclovir) reduces the severity and duration of herpes zoster and acute zoster-associated pain . Effective pain treatment in the acute phase reduces risk of PHN . A 90-day course of amitriptyline, started during the acute herpes zoster attack, was found in an RCT to reduce pain intensity assessed 6 months later . Given the risk of side effects, TCAs should be used with caution in older patients; a trial of gabapentin or pregabalin may be preferable . Anticonvulsants can effectively relieve postherpetic pain, as shown by meta-analyses of RCTs .","Persistent hyperglycemia is the primary factor responsible for nerve damage in diabetes mellitus. Diabetic neuropathy (DN) affects the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems. Maintenance of near-normal blood glucose levels is the best approach to primary and secondary prevention of DN. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and anticonvulsants are the medications of choice for neuropathic pain, but side effects are common. Pregabalin is specifically approved for DN. Duloxetine has also gained approval for DN in some countries. Combining medications that address different mechanisms (exempli gratia SNRIs or TCAs with gabapentinoids), while being mindful of drug interactions, can be helpful for treatment-resistant cases, and may enable smaller doses of one or both drugs to be given, which may reduce the total side-effect burden. Although efficacy in clinical trials is established, the use of opioids for the treatment of neuropathic pain remains controversial because of safety and overdose concerns, particularly in at-risk individuals, such as those with substance use disorder or psychiatric comorbidities, or those using benzodiazepines or other sedatives. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is pain that persists after the vesicular rash of herpes zoster has resolved. During an attack of acute herpes zoster (shingles), reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), previously dormant in the dorsal root ganglia, induces inflammation and neuronal destruction. TCAs and anticonvulsants are useful therapies for PHN; the physical, psychological and social consequences of PHN should also receive attention. Once developed, PHN is difficult to manage and thus efforts to prevent PHN are crucial via: prevention of VZV infection, boosting VZV immunity, treating at the time of acute herpes zoster infection, and effective treatment of the acute pain."
9781910797587,chp02,"This includes degradation of the articular cartilage, first at the joint surface but progressing to full thickness loss; thickening of the subchondral bone; osteophyte formation at the margins of the joint surfaces; variable degrees of synovial inflammation; and in the knee, damage to the cruciate ligaments and the menisci . Associations with both increased medial bone mineral density and bone-marrow lesions on MRI have been described . Gait analyses suggest that the most important force through the knee is the external adduction moment, which produces medial joint force in knees with a varus deformity (Figure 2.4) . MRI enables a three-dimensional evaluation of the joint and allows bone, cartilage and soft tissue to be visualized . However, studies using MRI require careful interpretation because of possible differences in methods used, such as different magnet strengths (exempli gratia 1.5T vs 0.2T) or different sequences (exempli gratia if fat suppression is used to visualize bone-marrow lesions) . These studies confirmed common abnormalities of most of the tissues in the painful OA joint, demonstrating not only cartilage thinning and loss but also bone-marrow lesions, synovitis, meniscal damage and extrusion, and ligament abnormalities (Figures 2.8, 2.9 and 2.10) . Using MRI, almost 90% of people over 50 with normal weight-bearing knee radiographs are found to have OA joint pathologies . Bone-marrow lesions have been associated with subsequent progression of joint-space narrowing and cartilage loss in the same joint compartment . The early changes in cartilage degradation are those of increased hydration along with progressive breakdown of the collagen fibrillar network, especially due to denaturation of type II collagen, at the joint surface in areas where mechanical forces are greatest . The loss of proteoglycan parallels the disease severity, and these structural changes may account for the failure of matrix repair . Cytokine activity plays a major role in cartilage homeostasis and is important in driving the OA process . Inflammatory and catabolic signals eventually overwhelm anti-inflammatory and anabolic signals (Figure 2.2), with OA cartilage being more susceptible to pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha; upregulation of TNFalpha receptors has been demonstrated in OA chondrocytes . MRI changes in bone are described later in this chapter . Synovitis - inflammation of the synovium - occurs with increasing frequency with progressive severity of OA . Clues as to the factors that may cause, or at least influence, the presence of synovitis have been studied in synovial fluid analyses . These breakdown products of articular cartilage may be an important cause of synovial inflammation . Cartilage fragments or shards have been reported in OA synovial tissue as well as fluid, but macroscopic fragments are probably not as important as extracellular-matrix macromolecules in promoting synovial inflammation . CPPD and apatite crystals are also seen in synovial biopsies and radiographs (chondrocalcinosis) and, again, become more prevalent with increasing disease severity . Elevated levels of cytokines (exempli gratia IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TNFalpha) and MMPs have been demonstrated in OA tissue; although these cytokines are also produced by chondrocytes, the synovium is thought to be the major site of production .","All tissues of the joint may show pathology, including cartilage, subchondral bone, the menisci and the synovium. The joint should be considered a functional organ, with gait, periarticular muscles and related mechanical forces all playing a role in pathology. Modern imaging has highlighted the extensive nature of the pathology, even in joints with limited radiographic evidence of damage."

The bleeding risk is also dependent on the platelet count, which is influenced by the degree of splenomegaly secondary to liver-induced portal hypertension . Chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis, results in diminished synthesis of clotting factors, especially factor (F)II, FVII, FIX and FX . Patients with chronic liver disease have reduced carboxylase activity, resulting in incomplete carboxylation of the precursor peptides . Furthermore, the carboxylation process depends on vitamin K; if vitamin K is lacking (exempli gratia in biliary obstruction), an assessment of clotting factor levels, particularly FVII, may underestimate the true capacity of the liver for synthesis . If infection is present, the fibrinogen level may be reduced more than would be expected for the degree of hepatic impairment as a result of the consumptive coagulopathy of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . FVIII is produced by endothelial cells as well as being synthesized in the liver, so in hepatic disease its synthesis is not solely dependent on the capacity of hepatocyte function . In DIC, levels of both factors are decreased, whereas in liver disease FV is low but FVIII is usually normal or high . In liver disease the platelet count is usually normal or reduced . The liver is a source of thrombopoietin, a protein that stimulates platelet production; decreased concentrations have been reported in patients with liver failure . While reduced platelet function (exempli gratia impaired aggregation to adenosine diphosphate [ADP]) in some patients may contribute to bleeding, elevated levels of VWF and decreases in a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 13 (ADAMTS13), an inhibitor of VWF, enhance platelet adhesion and may compensate for impaired platelet function and numbers . Impaired antithrombin synthesis by the diseased liver leads to a reduced plasma concentration, which may predispose to a consumptive coagulopathy . The anticoagulants proteins C and S are both vitamin-K dependent and synthesized by the liver, and their carboxylation, function and plasma levels are diminished in cirrhosis . Patients with both advanced liver disease and severe acute hepatitis are at risk of DIC (see Chapter 12) . Treatment of the coagulopathy associated with liver disease needs to address risks of bleeding and thrombosis . Furthermore, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials that support the effectiveness of fresh frozen plasma in limiting bleeding from invasive procedures in patients with cirrhosis . Studies show that shortening the PT with the potent clotting factor concentrate recombinant FVIIa does not improve control of variceal bleeding or hemorrhage during liver transplantation . The bleeding observed in patients with renal failure, usually bruising and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, is generally attributed to defects in platelet adhesion and aggregation . Despite biochemical evidence of platelet deficiencies, the results of clinical platelet aggregation tests are extremely variable and usually uninformative about the risk of bleeding, and generally correlate poorly with plasma urea or creatinine levels . Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis generally reduce the bleeding risk, though they may not be equally effective in all patients .","Liver disorders Acute and chronic liver disease can give rise to a variety of different hemostatic disorders; it is therefore important to assess each patient fully. Vitamin K therapy should be given if there is any possibility of deficiency. Although many patients have abnormal clotting tests, it is usually only necessary to treat those patients who are actively bleeding or require surgical intervention. Kidney disorders The risk of bleeding increases with the degree of renal failure. Dialysis reduces the hemorrhagic risk. Correction of anemia in the short term by red cell transfusion or in the long term with regular erythropoietin injections reduces the risk of bleeding."
9781912776153,chp5,"Palpitations are mostly intermittent, and obtaining a rhythm tracing at the time of the patient's symptoms is very important . . Patients at risk of cardiac arrhythmias can often be determined by obtaining a history and physical examination, and by reviewing baseline tests . Relevant features include any history of previous myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac surgery . In addition, any history to suggest the presence of structural heart disease, including hypertension or diabetes, makes an arrhythmia much more likely to be the cause of symptoms . Clinical examination should be performed to look for evidence of structural heart disease, including a cardiac murmur, signs of congestive heart failure as well as hypertension . A 12-lead ECG in an asymptomatic patient may reveal features such as pathological Q waves to indicate a previous MI and thus structural disease, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Referral for more detailed investigations to exclude structural heart disease may be necessary for some patients, particularly those with ventricular ectopics . Recording of a rhythm during symptoms is crucial to establishing the cause of palpitations . However, digital recording of rhythm abnormalities has replaced the traditional ECG in many circumstances, especially when palpitations are infrequent . These monitors are often used for 24-hour recording, but can be worn for up to 72 hours if required . The patient can trigger the device to record a rhythm strip at the time of symptoms, or auto-trigger features may be programmable . Smartphone and smartwatch apps now allow direct recording of the heart rhythm; other devices on the market transmit information via bluetooth technology to a smartphone . Electrophysiological (EP) testing was conceived in the 1960s as a means to provoke and study a patient's cardiac arrhythmia . Many patients, particularly those with severe or life-threatening arrhythmias, require provocative procedures to induce the tachycardia . For example, if palpitations, ventricular ectopic beats or syncope have occurred in a patient who has previously had a myocardial infarction and has left ventricular dysfunction, an EP study can determine whether ventricular tachycardia is inducible and is likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms . Abnormal recordings during an EP study may determine whether a pacemaker is required . However, the advent of digital recording methods, as well as the importance of left ventricular function in determining therapy, has meant that the EP study is now performed only infrequently to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias . Treadmill exercise testing can be used to evaluate arrhythmias, and is occasionally a useful option, particularly in cases where symptoms occur under exercise conditions . This is particularly the case when automaticity is mostly responsible for the cardiac arrhythmias, such as patients with ventricular ectopy or ventricular tachycardia without overt heart disease . In these patients, the exercise test will not only be useful at provoking the cardiac arrhythmia, but will also assist in planning ablation, in view of the importance of the 12-lead morphology of ventricular tachycardia at predicting the region of the heart that requires mapping and ablation .","Performing an electrocardiogram (12-lead if possible) during symptoms is essential. The frequency of a patient's symptoms will determine the best non-invasive test to apply. Non-invasive monitoring can be performed repeatedly if needed. Digital and smartphone technologies will expand in use in future. Treadmill exercise testing can be useful to induce cardiac arrhythmias in selected patients. Electrophysiological (EP) testing was initially conceived to provoke and identify cardiac arrhythmias. However, it is now performed infrequently solely as a diagnostic test; instead it is more often performed during an ablation procedure."
9781910797433,ch09,"Non-epithelial tumors are rare, accounting for 10-15% of all ovarian malignant neoplasms . The most common types are germ cell tumors (GCTs) and sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) (Table 9.1) . The prognosis of non-epithelial ovarian neoplasms tends to be better than for epithelial cancers, largely because most tend to present at an earlier stage: 60-70% of GCTs and 60-95% of SCSTs are detected at an early stage . They will commonly present at younger ages, compared with the more common epithelial ovarian cancer . Malignant germ cell tumors arising in the ovary (MOGCT) are estimated to affect about 60 women each year in England . In addition, several very rare syndromes linked with gonadal dysgenesis, including Turner and Swyer syndrome, have been associated with MOGCT, and it remains possible that there could be exceptionally rare families with increased risk, as seen in malignant testicular germ cell tumors . Since germ cells can differentiate to form all cell types seen in neonates and adults, any combination of pathologies is possible, although some are more common than others . Patients with choriocarcinoma/trophoblastic tumor elements will usually have elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and those with yolk sac tumors will produce alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (Table 9.2) . Thus, measurement of AFP, hCG and CA125 can help in the diagnostic work-up of patients with a suspected ovarian mass, and should be done in any woman under the age of 50 years who wants a fertility-sparing approach to treatment . This is because elevated hCG or AFP is virtually diagnostic of MOGCT, and could lead to fertility-sparing surgery rather than the usual more radical surgery used for primary epithelial cancers . Usually patients present with only a short history of lower abdominal swelling and pain arising from the pelvis, as these tumors tend to grow rapidly . SCSTs arise from the sex cords and ovarian stroma, and account for 5-8% of ovarian cancers . Granulosa cell tumors are the most common form of SCST, and account for 2-5% of all ovarian malignant neoplasms . There are two subtypes of granulosa cell tumors: juvenile and adult . Juvenile-type tumors account for only 5% of granulosa cell tumors, and typically occur in children and young adults . Adult-type tumors typically present during the perimenopausal or menopausal period . Adult subtype granulosa cell tumors have a microfollicular pattern, while juvenile subtypes present with a macrofollicular or cystic pattern . Maximal effort debulking surgery, aiming at complete cytoreduction, is the most effective treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent granulosa cell tumors . Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors typically occur during the third and fourth decades of life: about 75% of patients are under 40 years old at diagnosis . Typically, patients present with abdominal pain and a palpable abdominal mass . Surgery forms the mainstay of treatment of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors . Surgical treatment guidelines are similar to those for granulosa cell tumors, with fertility-sparing approaches being considered in early disease and young patients wishing to have children .","Non-epithelial malignant neoplasms account for 10-15% of ovarian cancers. They occur at younger ages than the more common epithelial ovarian cancer. Adequate surgical staging is essential, and should be performed even when fertility-sparing surgery is planned. Complete cytoreduction is the cornerstone of treatment in advanced and relapsed disease. There is inconclusive evidence for the use of systemic chemotherapy, rather than antihormonal treatment, in malignant non-epithelial ovarian tumors. In completely resected disease, there is little evidence to support a survival benefit with additional systemic treatment."
9781910797587,chp01,"An understanding of the key structures in normal synovial joints (Figure 1.1), including their composition and function, is a prerequisite for understanding any arthritic process . Cartilage tissue is largely composed of an extracellular matrix that is both synthesized and broken down by the chondrocytes . Articular cartilage has no blood vessels, lymphatics or nerves, so the chondrocytes receive nutrition by diffusion of molecules from the synovial fluid in the joint cavity through the extracellular matrix . The fibers are composed of compact, triple-helical collagen molecules (Figure 1.4), which are classified according to length and side chains: collagen type II makes up 80-90% of the articular cartilage collagen . Aggrecan is the major proteoglycan of articular cartilage, and has a protein core with glycosaminoglycan side chains of keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (Figure 1.5) . The aggrecan molecules in the extracellular matrix are stabilized by link protein and are attached to hyaluronic acid (HA) molecules, which are also very large glycosaminoglycans . Tissue loading results in changes in the degree of hydration of aggrecan in the extracellular matrix (via the hydrophilic glycosaminoglycan chains) . Normal cartilage homeostasis requires a balance between the synthesis and degradation of components in the extracellular matrix, both by chondrocytes and by the actions of various soluble mediators derived from the chondrocytes and synovium (Table 1.1) . The lower levels of the cartilage away from the joint cavity become calcified at a point called the tidemark, a dynamic structure that appears as a basophilic line on histological sections (see Figures 1.2 and 1.3) . As described above, the subchondral bone is intimately associated with the overlying cartilage and together probably act as a single structure for load transmission . Like cartilage, the thickness of the subchondral bone may vary with location within a joint; it may be thicker in the central weight-bearing areas of joints . Non-collagenous proteins present in the matrix include proteoglycans, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein . The normal synovium is well supplied with blood vessels, which supply nutrition to the intima and nearby cartilage, and nerves, which often extend to the intimal layer . The intimal layer, which is generally one or two cells (25-35 µm) in thickness, contains two cell types, or synoviocytes, which form a tight extracellular matrix by interdigitation of cell processes . These synovial fibroblasts are involved in the production of HA, extracellular matrix protein and adhesion molecules, and also in the production of cytokines (including IL-6 and IL-8), arachidonic acid derivatives, growth factors and MMPs . The synovial intimal extracellular matrix is composed largely of HA, chondroitin sulfates, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, collagen (types III-VI), fibronectin and laminin . Interactions between synoviocytes and the extracellular matrix play an important role in the maintenance of the intimal lining layer . Within the synovial cavity, healthy joints contain a small amount of synovial fluid, a lubricating liquid that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the cartilage . Up to 3 mL of synovial fluid have been aspirated from normal human knee joints, and these volumes may increase during exercise .","The synovial joint should be seen as a single dynamic structure with inter-relating components. Articular hyaline cartilage lines the end of each bone within a joint; it allows an efficient gliding motion when the joint moves, and absorbs and dissipates mechanical load. Subchondral bone is intimately associated with the overlying cartilage, which together probably act as a single structure for load transmission. Healthy synovial joints contain a small amount of synovial fluid, a lubricating liquid that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the cartilage. The complex joint structure provides frictionless articulation and load-bearing abilities."
9781910797211,ch08,"A variety of etiologies that are not secondary to the idiopathic loss of neurons in the substantia nigra may cause parkinsonian syndromes; they include infections, drugs, toxins and structural lesions . It may be impossible to distinguish idiopathic Parkinson's disease from other parkinsonian syndromes by clinical features alone . This is the most common cause of secondary parkinsonism and it is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, because clinical features may be indistinguishable . There is some evidence that patients who develop drug-induced parkinsonism may have subclinical Lewy body Parkinson's disease, which may be unmasked by dopamine-blocking agents . Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome) presents with gait disturbance and falls (predominantly backward) in over 50% of cases, and is a disease of later life . Variants of PSP include progressive dementia resembling Alzheimer's disease, pure akinesia and a parkinsonian phenotype . Sophisticated MRI of the brain can distinguish PSP from Parkinson's disease, in that the midbrain tectum and tegmentum atrophy in advanced PSP; in addition, the course of PSP is progressive without significant response to levodopa . However, PSP-P is characterized by an asymmetric onset, tremor and a moderate initial therapeutic response to levodopa, and the condition is frequently confused with Parkinson's disease . The main problem is in differentiating Parkinson's disease from the striatonigral type in which the parkinsonian features of MSA include progressive bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability, and signs that are usually bilateral . Parkinsonian DLB may be indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease, but patients with the former have early-onset dementia (progressive cognitive decline interfering with normal social and occupational function) and may have hallucinations, delusions and even psychosis in the absence of dopaminergic therapy . Response to levodopa tends not to be as complete as in Parkinson's disease, although some patients do respond . Often, young-onset Parkinson's disease can remain exquisitely sensitive to levodopa for many years, with concurrent development of increasing dyskinesia . Patients with young-onset parkinsonism manifest dystonia, which may respond to dopaminergic drugs . PET scans demonstrate markedly reduced 6-fluorodopa uptake in patients with young-onset Parkinson's disease, while fluorodopa uptake is normal in patients with dopa-responsive dystonia . Patients with this syndrome have a long-standing hemiatrophy of the body and develop a progressive bradykinesia with dystonic movements around the age of 40 years . Neuroacanthocytosis is a rare cause of parkinsonism and typically presents with a hyperkinetic movement disorder, including chorea, tic-like features and polyneuropathy . In this condition, tremor tends to be less prominent than in Parkinson's disease, and other movement disorders, including dystonia, may be seen . The clinical features include parkinsonism characterized by early difficulties with gait and balance, early speech problems, and dystonia involving the face (grimace) and feet (cock walk) . Usually patients present with a one-sided, progressive syndrome that does not respond to levodopa . Vascular disease is a rare cause of a straightforward parkinsonian syndrome with a variety of clinical presentations . Onset is either acute or subacute, and symptoms (usually bilateral) are those seen in classic Parkinson's disease, including tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability .","It may be impossible to distinguish Parkinson's disease from other parkinsonian syndromes by clinial features alone. Progressive supranuclear palsy presents with gait disturbance and falls in later life; asymmetric signs (exempli gratia rest-tremor) favor a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Patients with parkinsonian dementia with Lewy bodies have early-onset dementia, and may have hallucinations or psychosis in the absence of dopaminergic therapy. Parkinsonism that presents before the age of 20 is more likely to be the result of a widespread degenerative or genetic disorder. Drug-induced parkinsonism is the most common cause of secondary parkinsonism."
9781910797181,ch08,"Tobacco smoking is a highly toxic form of nicotine use . Although nicotine itself appears to carry minimal risk of serious disease, tobacco smoking is deadly, contributing to dozens of diseases that cause disability and death . Without effective intervention, cigarette smoking is expected to have killed some 520 million people worldwide by 2050 . Unfortunately, the health services in most countries have not been geared up to provide evidence-based support for quitting, even very low-cost clinical programs that could be incorporated into existing clinical services . In countries that do have comprehensive smoking cessation programs, the challenge is in ensuring that smokers make full use of these services . While research on improving treatments for smoking-related disorders continues, smoking cessation remains our best hope for reducing the burden of tobacco-related death and disease over the next 50 years . If higher rates of smoking cessation are to be achieved, concerted action is required on all fronts: fiscal, legislative, educational and clinical . develop clinical interventions that improve on the success rates of existing methods . make greater use of effective treatments so that the proportion of attempts that are successful increases considerably . It seems reasonable to suppose that if a pure nicotine delivery system could be found that was almost as efficient as the cigarette and also as palatable, it would be more effective than the current generation of nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) products in helping smokers to quit . Nevertheless, even if smokers continued to use such a product indefinitely, there would be minimal health risks, so this is an important area for development . Ensuring effective use of nicotine-replacement therapy . There is now evidence that in countries where it has been studied, such as the UK, use of NRT bought over the counter and used without any professional support is not improving smokers' success rates . To date, no vaccine has been found to be effective in clinical trials but the principle is intriguing and research continues . Increasing use of traditional treatment services . A smoker's chances of stopping successfully without help are less than 5% in any given quit attempt . So far, smoking cessation services have been delivered via traditional clinical channels, often modeled on mental health services, such as one-to-one meetings with a counselor, or group meetings with other smokers . Telephone helplines have proven to be effective, when provided by a trained counselor following evidence-based protocols . Telephone counseling that depends on smokers' initiative to call for help ('hotlines') is under-used and not as effective as counseling programs that schedule regular calls, paralleling the structure of face-to-face counseling . A systematic review of randomized controlled trials has concluded that internet-based interventions can aid cessation but many do not and it is not clear what features make an effective internet support program . Although more than 200 stop-smoking apps are available, very few have data on their effectiveness . Most of them are unlikely to be effective given that they do not use evidence-based behavior change techniques .","If the pandemic of death from lung disease and cardiovascular disease is to be controlled, millions of smokers must quit. Price increases and mass media campaigns play a crucial role in motivating attempts to stop smoking. Effective treatments are available to support quit attempts; a major challenge lies in finding ways to get these treatments to the majority of smokers. In many countries, affordable and scalable systems need to be developed to ensure that smokers are offered evidence-based support for stopping as a matter of routine. In countries that have comprehensive smoking cessation programs, such as the UK and the USA, the main challenge is to ensure that smokers make full use of such services. More effective treatments, and treatments to help smokers who are not currently being helped, are focuses for current and future research."
9781912776207,ch3,"T-cell lymphomas account for 10-15% of lymphoid malignancies, although the incidence varies geographically (see page 38) . The incidence of PTCL in the USA is less than 1 per 100 000 according to the latest Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry . The incidence was highest for PTCL (0.78), followed by mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome (0.54) and T/NK-cell lymphoid neoplasms not otherwise specified (NOS) (0.49) . While the incidence of lymphoid neoplasms as a whole appears to have plateaued in the USA during 1997-2006, this largely reflects slowing in the rate of increase of B-cell neoplasms, particularly in white men . Rates of T/NK-cell lymphoid neoplasms rose by 1.17% annually, and higher rates were seen in black men (2.2%) and Asian women (2.3%) . In the UK, approximately 1000 people were diagnosed with PTCL in England and Wales in 2008, representing 10% of approximately 10 000 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma . The incidence of the different subtypes of PTCL in the SEER registry is shown in Table 3.1 . The overall frequency of the different subtypes of PTCL from the International PTCL project are shown in Table 3.2, based on retrospective analysis of 1314 cases of previously untreated PTCL or ENKTCL diagnosed between 1990 and 2002 at 22 centers worldwide . Based on the 1997-2006 SEER data, rates of nodal PTCL are, generally, highest in black ethnic groups, followed by white and Asian groups, for both men and women (Figure 3.1); however, the pattern varies with subtype . For example, the frequency of AITL is higher among Asian men than black or white men . A study of 13 107 cases of PTCL in SEER registries between 2000 and 2012 reported that the annual incidence was highest in black people and lowest in Native Americans . The incidence of PTCL-NOS, ALCL and ATLL was higher in black than in non-Hispanic white people, whereas the incidence of AITL was lower . Asians/Pacific Islanders had a higher incidence of AITL, ATLL, nasal-type ENKTCL and NK-cell leukemia, and a lower incidence of ALCL . Hispanic people had a higher incidence of AITL and ENKTCL . Native Americans had a lower incidence of PTCL-NOS . The frequency of the most common subtypes of PTCL varies geographically . In Europe, the nodal subtypes account for more than 80% of PTCL cases in Caucasian patients (PTCL-NOS 34%; AITL 28%; ALK + ALCL 6%; ALK - ALCL 9%) . PTCL-NOS is more common in North America but less common in Europe and East Asia . AITL is more common in Europe than in Asia or North America . EATL is more common in areas with a high incidence of celiac disease - it accounts for 5.8% and 9.1% of PTCLs in North America and Europe, respectively, but only 1.9% in Asia . EBV-associated lymphoproliferative T- and NK-cell neoplasms (exempli gratia ENKTCL) are more commonly seen in East Asian countries such as Korea and northern China, and in Native American populations from South and Central America . As noted above, the increasing incidence of ENKTCL in East Asia is partly due to endemic HTLV-1 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections .","T-cell lymphomas are rare, representing approximately 10% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas. PTCL subtypes display marked variation in geographic distribution; AITL and EATL are more frequent in Europe whereas ATLL is more common in Japan and the Caribbean basin and ENKTCL in South East Asia. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 is strongly implicated in lymphomagenesis in ATLL, and Epstein-Barr virus in ENKTCL."
9781908541062,ch_3,"The encoded proteins are critical in determining the manner by which an individual's immune system recognizes and responds to provocative stimuli, and the MHC also contains many other genes related to immune function . Particular HLA-DRB1 molecules are more common in individuals with RA, and these share a sequence in a part of the molecule that influences the peptides that are bound and therefore viewed by the immune system (Figure 2.2) . The shared epitope influences both the incidence and the severity of RA, and individuals who inherit two shared epitope-encoding HLA-DRB1 alleles suffer particularly aggressive disease . It has been hypothesized that the shared epitope specifically binds an autoantigen-derived peptide with high affinity, thereby predisposing to an autoimmune arthritis . Although the autoantigen in RA has not been definitively identified, a number have been proposed (see Chapter 3) and, in most cases, specific peptides derived from these proteins can bind to HLA-DR molecules containing the shared epitope . For example, HLA type also biases the repertoire of T cells generated in the thymus, and the shared epitope could, by chance, select T cells with a particular affinity for joint antigens . The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium published the first GWAS of RA and, with subsequent studies, has identified and confirmed a number of genes associated with the disease . These include genes encoding proteins such as protein tyrosine phosphatase-22 (PTPN22), an important regulator of lymphocyte activation, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), a downregulator of T cell activation, and STAT4, a signaling molecule downstream of the interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 receptor . Consequently, many minor genetic influences await identification, including more recent concepts such as gene copy number variants . i) has an odds ratio (OR) of developing anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)-positive RA that is about five times that of someone who is shared-epitope negative . The shared epitope and PTPN22 appear to be associated only with ACPA-positive RA, and seronegative disease appears to have a distinct, and much less well defined, etiology . For example, autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor [RF] and ACPA) first appear in blood 10-15 years before clinical onset, suggesting that immune tolerance breaks down around that time . The absence of an infectious agent in arthritic tissue does not exclude a potential etiologic role, because a transient infection could trigger a chronic inflammatory process . These would only provide positive results, however, if patients shared a common dietary trigger whereas individuals generally identify different triggers . In brief, a susceptible individual inherits a collection of predisposing alleles, which might include a shared-epitope-encoding HLA-DRB1 allele and an RA-associated PTPN22 allele . It is notable that many of the genes associated with seropositive RA encode proteins that affect immune cell function and are also associated with other autoimmune diseases . The immune effects of these genes may be relevant either in the tissues, by prolonging immune responses, or potentially in the thymus by influencing positive and negative selection of T cells . It now appears that smoking triggers the formation of ACPA in genetically predisposed individuals, and that this occurs some years before disease onset .","Genetic and environmental factors both play a role in the etiology of RA. A number of genetic associations with RA have now been identified. Smoking is an important environmental trigger that, in shared-epitope-positive individuals, stimulates the production of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs). Autoantibodies appear up to 15 years before clinical disease is manifest, suggesting a further influence of additional environmental triggers at a later time point. Subclinical inflammation starts to manifest approximately 5 years before disease onset."
9781910797105,ch09,"Multidisciplinary teams are the core of community-based services for people with schizophrenia (Table 9.1) . Different models of care management exist, but systematic reviews have shown that it is most effective when combined with assertive community treatment . Meanwhile, specialist rehabilitation services can reduce the enduring deficits of chronic schizophrenia and improve day-to-day social functioning . A first episode of psychosis requires urgent referral to a specialist mental health team or an early intervention team for assessment within 2 weeks . The next step is to communicate the diagnosis and treatment plan effectively to the patient and family where appropriate, including what the diagnosis means and why it has been made . Antipsychotic drug treatment should be chosen jointly with the patient after discussion of the benefits and side effects, and initiated at a low dosage; for example, risperidone, 1-2 mg daily for 1-2 weeks before optimizing the dose within the recommended range for a 4-week trial . Therapeutic response should be carefully monitored, ideally using a recognized rating scale such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Table 2.7, page 21) . In addition, psychological support and treatment should be initiated, ideally cognitive therapy for 16 weeks in addition to drug treatment . Poor adherence to drug treatment is not unique to schizophrenia (Table 9.3) . Shared decision-making between the person with schizophrenia and healthcare professional, taking into account the views of the carer where appropriate, is the cornerstone of management in schizophrenia and essential to improving outcomes . The clinician must provide quality information on both the benefits and adverse effects of each recommended treatment, and the expected time to response, so that patients and carers can make informed decisions . It is particularly important to discuss the side effects that the person is and is not willing to tolerate in order to minimize non-adherence to treatment . This is a growing area of activity, especially around the potential of web- and smartphone-based monitoring and interventions to help people with schizophrenia to better manage their own illness (exempli gratia www . One mainstay of relapse prevention in schizophrenia is maintenance drug treatment (see page 90), which is known to reduce relapse rates by three to five times if adherence is good . Relapse risk can be reduced further by 50% with added cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) if early signs of relapse, such as racing thoughts or suspiciousness, appear (see Case history 11.1, page 104) . In terms of the potential for practical management, controlled studies have shown that monitoring of early warning signs every 1-2 weeks, linked to multicomponent intervention, reduces rates of relapse by about half compared with standard care, id est from about 30% per year to 15% . To prevent full relapse, interventions may be offered such as increasing medication dose, changing drug delivery mode, psychological interventions and psychosocial support . Often, carers of people with schizophrenia require assessment of their own needs . About 30% of people will not respond adequately to two adequate trials of drug treatment of different classes .",Assertive community treatment is the most effective model of community care. Urgent specialist referral and multidisciplinary assessment are needed for first-episode psychosis. Cognitive therapy should be offered in addition to drug treatments. Maintaining and improving physical health is vital. Clozapine should be considered early in treatment resistance. m-health approaches are becoming increasingly important.
9781912776153,chp12,"Cardiac devices are the mainstay of treatment for patients with bradycardias, ventricular tachyarrhythmias and some types of heart failure . The syndrome occurs in one in every 600 cardiac patients older than 65 years, and accounts for approximately half of all pacemaker implants . Sinus pauses of more than 5 seconds in patients with presyncope or syncope usually require pacing . Heart block in one of these forms accounts for 40-60% of patients who have pacemakers implanted . In some cases of heart failure, the systolic contraction of the ventricles is not synchronous; parts of the left and right ventricles contract in an uncoordinated fashion, resulting in reduced cardiac output and functional mitral regurgitation . If the patient is dependent on the pacemaker (id est has no underlying heart rhythm), then a temporary pacing lead is inserted and a permanent system is reimplanted when the infection has cleared . Occasionally, leads or devices have a higher than expected failure rate, in which case the manufacturer issues a product recall (see page 173) . Removal is not usually recommended unless it is mandated (exempli gratia the possibility of a sudden device failure in a patient who is dependent on pacing) or if the patient experiences device/lead-related problems . Lead integrity can be assessed non-invasively via the pacemaker generator, previously on an annual basis, but newer devices are able to check lead function daily and even attempt automatic reprogramming to maintain safety . Very early pacemakers were life-saving devices but had two major limitations: they did not sense the underlying heart rhythm and delivered pacing impulses constantly, whether required or not (fixed-rate or asynchronous) . Modern pacemakers deliver demand-pacing, the ability to sense spontaneous cardiac depolarization and to inhibit pacemaker output; they therefore work only when required (Figure 12.8), thereby extending battery life . Initially, demand pacemakers were only able to pace the ventricles at a constant rate (exempli gratia 70 pulses/minute) irrespective of the metabolic demands of the patient . However, current devices can be interrogated wirelessly, a development that has allowed pacemakers and defibrillators to be monitored continuously from the patient's home environment (see page 174) . For complete heart block, a rate-responsive ventricular demand pacemaker (VVIR) is as effective as DDD pacing in the elderly, but DDD pacing is still preferred in younger patients and patients with good exercise capacity . Modern pacemakers use an algorithm that minimizes the amount of ventricular pacing, thereby reducing the possibility of future heart failure (see page 158) . Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are the treatment of choice for patients with life-threatening ventricular tachycardias (VTs) . All ICDs have back-up pacemakers that prevent the heart from slowing down too much after a shock is delivered . As patients who are eligible for CRT have poor ventricular function and are at high risk of sudden death, many CRT devices also have defibrillators . ICDs are implanted either subcutaneously, as for a pacemaker, in the left or right deltopectoral area, or (rarely) submuscularly in thin patients to avoid future device erosion . The shock delivery lead is positioned in the right ventricle and constantly senses the underlying heart rate .",Pacemakers are the treatment of choice in patients with symptomatic bradycardia. All implantable defibrillators have a back-up pacemaker. Patients with pacemakers can live a near-normal life. Patients need regular review (usually annually) to check battery life and lead integrity.
9781910797310,chp2,"The most common symptoms of advanced intrathoracic disease are cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, bronchial obstruction and dysphagia . These symptoms usually trigger a chest X-ray (CXR) . Some lung cancers are identified by an abnormality found on imaging that is carried out for reasons other than chest symptoms (exempli gratia for employment reasons or before elective surgery) . Initial evaluation of a patient after imaging should involve tissue biopsy by bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, or guided ultrasonography or CT . This plan must then be considered in terms of the patient's comorbidities (cardiac and respiratory function) and individual wishes . Every patient with suspected lung cancer should undergo a thorough history and physical examination, which, together with laboratory testing can assess comorbid conditions and the likelihood of metastases . CT, and in some cases positron emission tomography (PET), provides a non-invasive assessment of tumor size (T), mediastinal node enlargement (N) and potential metastases (M) (see Staging, Chapter 3) . Small biopsies and cytology specimens . About 70% of patients present with advanced stage lung cancer . Diagnosis is usually made from small biopsy and cytology specimens . Historically, pathologists only needed to distinguish between small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but in recent years therapeutic and genetic advances have driven the need for larger quantities of tissue for histological subclassification, immunohistochemistry and molecular and immune pathology . The 2015 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart includes a new classification for small biopsies and cytology similar to that proposed in the 2011 Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification . Well-differentiated tumors with adenocarcinoma morphology (acinar, papillary, lepidic, micropapillary) or squamous cell carcinoma (unequivocal keratinization and well-formed classical bridges) on routine light microscopy can be diagnosed as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, respectively, without immunohistochemistry . Poorly differentiated tumors should undergo limited immuno-histochemistry . A single adenocarcinoma marker (exempli gratia thyroid transcription factor 1 [TTF1] or Napsin-A) or squamous cell carcinoma marker (exempli gratia p40, cytokeratin 5/6 or p63) can be used to classify most tumors . Carcinomas lacking clear differentiation by morphology and immunohistochemistry are classified as 'NSCLC, not otherwise specified (NOS)' . NOS carcinomas that stain with adenocarcinoma markers are classified as 'NSCLC, favor adenocarcinoma'; tumors that stain with squamous markers are classified as 'NSCLC, favor squamous cell carcinoma' . In this way, a diagnosis of NSCLC-NOS can be avoided in up to 90% of cases . Molecular testing for tumor gene (somatic) mutations . The discovery of specific gene mutations in NSCLC (Table 2.1) has led to the development of targeted therapies . Furthermore, adenocarcinomas with ALK - MET rearrangements are responsive to crizotinib, and patients with adenocarcinoma or NSCLC-NOS are more responsive to pemetrexed than are those with squamous cell carcinoma . In the initial randomized phase 2 study of bevacizumab and chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, bevacizumab was associated with life-threatening hemorrhage in patients with squamous cell carcinoma; therefore, it is contraindicated in patients with this NSCLC histology .",The 2015 World Health Organization Classification of Lung Tumors recommends the use of immunohistochemistry for the classification of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Classification of NSCLC further into specific pathological subtypes (exempli gratia adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma) will determine eligibility for certain types of molecular testing and aid therapeutic decisions based on the specific histological and genetic characteristics of the tumor. An epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation is a validated predictive marker for response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments.
9781908541178,ch_5,"A significant proportion of individuals over 40 years of age show some disc space narrowing, osteophytic spurs or age-related spondylolisthesis on radiographs without corresponding clinical symptoms . In addition, disc bulges, protrusions or extrusions at one or more vertebral levels have been identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in over 50% of asymptomatic subjects . Further, when remission of symptoms occurs, in all likelihood the osseous abnormalities will remain unchanged, and even the soft-tissue disc-related lesions will still be present or little changed . These radiographic anatomic abnormalities are often perceived as the causal factor of low back pain in a wide range of individuals, but in view of these statistics - and as pain cannot be assessed from a radiological scan of any type - it is worthwhile considering when, and even if, the various radiological techniques are appropriate . In contrast, significant radiographic findings are highly likely in a patient with low back pain and/or sciatica and evidence of any 'red flags' (see Table 1.1), or in a patient who has suffered a severe trauma capable of causing a fracture . Soft tissue abnormalities, disc protrusions, infections, cysts, tumors and facet joint arthritis are characterized better by MRI than by plain radiography, though the findings may still be poorly correlated with clinical findings . MRI is more sensitive than either radiography or CT in identifying abnormalities in patients with low back pain, and does not carry the risk of X-ray exposure, but it is more expensive and more likely to provide worrisome detail rather than useful information . Gadolinium-enhanced MRI utilizes a contrast material to detect spinal tissues with increased blood flow . For example, gadolinium-enhanced MRI can detect radiculitis (nerve root inflammation), where there is a high correlation between marked nerve root enhancement and clinically relevant radiculopathy in patients with or without disc protrusions . Descriptions of disc abnormalities are very important in patients with low back pain, but the nomenclature used to describe disc modifications is not standardized . Although electrodiagnostic testing can confirm the presence of a nerve root lesion, it cannot indicate the precise level of the nerve root compression . Electrodiagnostic testing consists of sensory nerve conduction studies - sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and sensory F-wave latencies - and electromyography (EMG), which may be used singly or in combination . Nonetheless, the precision of EMG in one study of patients with clinical and radiographic (CT) findings of nerve root compression was as low as 20% when the EMG was correlated with surgical findings . Electrodiagnostic studies are not required for patients with low back pain of any severity if there is no subjective or objective evidence of nerve root impingement manifested by hypesthesia, asymmetric hypoactive reflexes, incontinence, sexual dysfunction or muscle weakness . It should be remembered, however, that for most low back pain syndromes, a careful history and examination and radiological studies will provide the necessary information for starting appropriate conservative therapies, or for considering surgical intervention, even without electrodiagnostic testing . Blood tests are also indicated to identify the potential causes of vertebral osteoporotic fractures .","Identifiable radiographic abnormalities such as disc degeneration, disc protrusions and osteophytes are common in individuals over 40 years of age and almost universal in those over 50, but without corresponding clinical findings. In geriatric patients, radiographic evidence of spinal degeneration is commonplace but may not be a source of back pain. In addition, geriatric radiographic abnormalities tend to persist after a patient goes into remission. In individuals over the age of 50, radiographic evaluation has a greater likelihood of identifying a tumor, osteoporotic fracture, infection or severe spinal stenosis. MRI is the most sensitive radiographic technique to identify anatomic alterations of the spinal elements. Discography is a relatively unreliable method of determining the locus of disc symptomatology, with numerous false positives. When CT/MRI and the examination do not define the pathology, electromyography (EMG) may be helpful, but at best this has less than 80% accuracy in detecting a nerve root lesion. Laboratory tests usually are not needed for acute low back pain unless 'red flags' are present, or for patient monitoring to avoid potential hematologic, hepatic or renal drug-related complications."
9781910797617,chp4,"Treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) involves repeated cycles of myelotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in prolonged cytopenia that requires intensive supportive care . Despite significant advances in supportive care over the last few decades, the treatment of AML is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly related to infection . In addition, proven (and suspected) invasive fungal infections occur in 14-28% of patients following induction chemotherapy, , and are associated with early mortality . During initial induction therapy, it is common practice to admit patients, typically for 3-4 weeks, until neutrophil levels recover, although data to support this approach are limited . In a pediatric population, a retrospective study by the Children's Oncology Group found no evidence that mandatory hospitalization reduced either systemic infections or treatment-related mortality . Similar studies in adults have not been reported, but until more data become available, it seems reasonable to admit patients for at least the first 3-4 weeks of induction chemotherapy, unless easily accessible 24-hour supportive care is available . Limited data suggest that using a high-efficiency particulate-air-filtered facility is beneficial, and although this cannot be considered a standard recommendation, some indirect evidence suggests that this could reduce the rate of fungal infection . These studies have also shown that use of G-CSF reduces the duration of hospitalization, duration of fever and antibiotic use, and does not retard platelet recovery . Based on current data, G-CSF is not recommended for all patients; however, its use can be considered in order to accelerate neutrophil recovery in patients with active or persistent infection, and those who are hemodynamically unstable secondary to infection . Prophylactic use of quinolone antibiotics has been shown to reduce infection and mortality rates after chemotherapy . Based on the available evidence, antibiotic prophylaxis after chemotherapy can be considered as standard care, and is a component of most international recommendations . The overall consensus, based on the available data, is that antifungal prophylaxis with posaconazole following chemotherapy is beneficial, Micafungin is an alternative if azoles are contraindicated . Leukapheresis, hydroxyurea and low-dose cytosine have all been suggested as treatment for hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell [WBC] count >= 100 000/mm at presentation), although recent data suggest that none of these interventions reduce early treatment-related mortality in high-risk patients . Among patients with AML, a WBC count at presentation of >=100 000/mm is considered high risk for developing TLS and hyperurcemia, and rasburicase should be considered for prophylaxis . Although not part of any standard recommendation, good central venous access is considered essential for the administration of intensive chemotherapy and for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) . Although there are data suggesting that even with chemotherapy, the Hickman catheter is superior; this cannot be considered a standard recommendation based on these limited data . Recent data suggest that it is not acceptable to withhold prophylactic platelet infusion at this threshold when there is increased risk of bleeding, especially in the central nervous system . There is no evidence to support routine use of granulocyte infusion to reduce treatment-related infection and mortality .","The standard treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) involves repeated cycles of myelotoxic chemotherapy, resulting in prolonged cytopenia that requires intensive supportive care. Treatment of AML is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, mostly related to infection; this risk is compounded by the emergence of bacteria with multidrug resistance. Standard practice is for patients to be hospitalized for induction chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery is achieved (3-4 weeks). Following chemotherapy, prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection and reduce mortality rates is a standard recommendation; the choice of antibiotic should be informed by the local antibiogram. Prophylaxis with antifungals with both anti-mold and anticandida activity is beneficial. Attention to good hygiene, particularly dental and perianal care, is important."
9783318067095,ch7,"Digital biomarkers and clinical outcomes . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) came together in 2016 to create the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS and other Tools) glossary resource to help clarify terms in this confusing space (Figure 7.1) . BEST defines an outcome as any 'measurable characteristic … that is influenced or affected by an individual's baseline state or an intervention as in a clinical trial or other exposure . For example, 'average gait speed' for walking bouts greater than a certain number of steps measured over multiple days outside the clinic may be a direct measure of mobility, which is one component of physical functioning . The industry generally makes a distinction between a digitally collected COA and a non-digital one (exempli gratia a paper questionnaire) by putting an 'e' for 'electronic' in front of the acronym (exempli gratia PRO [patient-reported outcome] to ePRO, COA to eCOA) . The possibility of a fifth COA to describe digital clinical outcome assessments, and specifically those measurements made using technology, was proposed during a summer 2018 Public Workshop at the FDA, though no firm next step was defined . It takes far more work to make human assessments digital than to simply translate a paper questionnaire into an app and put an 'e' in front of the tool (exempli gratia PRO to ePRO) . 'Ability to go about my daily activities' is a meaningful aspect of health to MS patients . A PRO (or even an ePRO) could measure a person's ability to perform activities of daily living through a self-reported survey . Self-reported measures require the person to reflect on and assess their own ability, leading to data that are meaningful to that individual, but potentially fraught with person-to-person variability, and subject to recall bias . A PerfO (performance outcome) might measure the amount of time it takes a person to walk 25 m . This approach has the benefit of not relying on patient recall, but it is an imperfect measure of the real outcome of interest - the ability to perform daily living tasks in a natural environment . We can also combine multimodal data from sensors, questionnaires and other clinical data (exempli gratia lab test, genomic tests) to create composite measures or 'complex biomarkers' . For example, you could use sensor, keyboard, voice and speech data from a smartphone to construct a composite measure for cognition, and augment that measure over time with genetic data to make it more multimodal . Over time, a useful distinction between metric types will be whether the measurement required action by a human intermediary to gather the data (Figure 7.3) . At the passive end of the spectrum, human participation is minimal and sensors simply capture data as individuals engage in daily activities like eating and sleeping . Hybrids of these two measures that use multimodal assessments and combine active and passive measures will also be valuable . An example is using actigraphy to passively measure when an individual fell asleep, coupled with an ePRO asking the individual to self-report the time .","'Effective, unambiguous communication is essential for efficient translation of promising scientific discoveries into approved medical products' (US Food and Drug Administration, BEST framework). Today, many key terms and definitions have been used inconsistently, and this ambiguity makes it difficult to evaluate products and evidence. For many measurements, it can be helpful to think about whether the data were collected actively through human intervention (exempli gratia a clinician observing the patient, or a patient filling in a diary) or passively through a sensor. Most high-quality data sources will likely be 'multimodal', meaning that the data will come from multiple sensors. Developing a common set of language around biomarkers, measurements, outcomes and other terms will streamline premarket discussions between regulators and industry, and also postmarket with patients and providers. The authors defined a first draft set of definitions, which we expect and hope will evolve as technologies and applications develop over time. If someone uses a term you don't know in a conversation, best practice is to ask the person to clarify what they mean. Many terms are still in early development and have loose definitions."
9781908541703,ch_7,"Treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years reduces the relative risk of dying from breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women (see below) . Subsequent trials confirmed these results in both pre- and postmenopausal women, and showed that tamoxifen reduced the incidence of local recurrence, distant metastases and contralateral breast cancer . These trials have been subjected to quinquennial review by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), which demonstrated in 1990 that women under 50 years of age who were given tamoxifen had a 12% reduction in the risk for disease recurrence and a non-significant reduction in mortality . The most recent reports of the ATLAS and ATTOM trials support a further 5 years of hormone therapy (tamoxifen if still premenopausal and an aromatase inhibitor if postmenopausal) in patients who have already received 5 years of tamoxifen . Many clinicians believe that this evidence could be extended to prolong treatment with aromatase inhibitors beyond 5 years, particularly in patients with higher risk of relapse (see below) . Both classes of aromatase inhibitor have established superiority over tamoxifen in metastatic breast cancer and have therefore been evaluated as adjuvant therapy . The Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial was the first to compare a modern aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole, with tamoxifen as initial treatment in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer . In a sequence trial, the change is planned at the start, with patients receiving tamoxifen for 2-3 years and then changing to an aromatase inhibitor . The recognition that hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer carries a protracted risk over time, with some patients relapsing 5-15 years after diagnosis (with indeed more deaths after 5 years than before), has led to interest in treatment with endocrine therapy beyond 5 years . The National Canadian Cancer Institute MA-17 trial was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in over 5000 postmenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer, who were disease free after standard treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years . In the trials, patients started an aromatase inhibitor any time after they had taken tamoxifen for 4 years . There is little doubt that postmenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer should receive an aromatase inhibitor as part of their adjuvant therapy . Conversely, patients with ER positive disease may be at low and protracted risk of relapse and may therefore benefit from extended therapy; at present, this would be tamoxifen followed by an aromatase inhibitor, as there are no data to support the use of aromatase inhibitor monotherapy for more than 5 years . A number of clinical trials have been designed to investigate the effectiveness of GnRH analogs in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer . A randomized trial comparing 2-weekly dose-dense chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with the same drugs given in a 3-weekly regimen found that dose-dense treatment was superior in terms of both DFS and overall survival . These trials showed a significant benefit of treatment with trastuzumab for 12 months at 2-year follow-up .","Adjuvant hormonal treatment and chemotherapy reduces the risk of recurrence of breast cancer by 33% and improves survival. The absolute benefit for an individual woman depends on her initial risk. For women with strongly estrogen-receptor(ER) positive breast cancer, endocrine treatment is the mainstay of treatment, and the additional benefit of chemotherapy should be calculated. Postmenopausal women with ER positive breast cancer should be offered an aromatase inhibitor as part of standard adjuvant treatment. Trial evidence supports a further 5 years of hormone therapy in patients who have already received 5 years of tamoxifen -tamoxifen for premenopausal women and an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women. Women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer should be offered anti-HER2-targeted therapy (provided there are no medical contraindications) as part of standard adjuvant treatment. Taxane-based chemotherapy is recommended for women at high risk (node positive and high-risk node negative). Well-designed and managed clinical trials remain the preferred context for treatment."
9781910797150,ch01,"It is estimated that 80-100% of patients receiving chemotherapy without antiemetic prophylaxis will experience some level of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) . The sensation of nausea and the act of vomiting are protective reflexes that rid the intestine and stomach of toxic substances . Although nausea may be considered a prodromal phase to the act of vomiting, patients may experience significant nausea without vomiting . Conversely, patients may have sudden emesis without nausea . Nausea has been assumed to be the conscious awareness of unusual sensations in the 'vomiting center' of the brainstem (see below), but the existence of such a center and its relationship to nausea remain controversial . The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting are not well defined . Vomiting is a reflex activated by toxic substances such as chemotherapy drugs, which may directly affect areas in the cerebral cortex and the medulla oblongata, or may stimulate the small intestine via the vagus nerve . Afferent impulses, triggered from the cerebral cortex, chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), pharynx and vagal afferent fibers of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, then travel to the vomiting center (VC) - termed the 'central pattern generator' by some authors - in the lateral reticular formation of the medulla (Figure 1.1) . The VC is the primary structure that coordinates the mechanisms of nausea and vomiting; it is sensitive to several neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, substance P), which are released through these pathways . Each individual may require a different level of stimulation to the VC to reach the threshold for nausea or vomiting, such that individuals will experience different responses to the same stimuli . The mechanism that is best supported by research involves an effect on the upper small intestine . When rapidly dividing enterochromaffin cells in the GI tract are damaged, serotonin is released and binds to vagal afferent receptors in the wall of the bowel that activate the VC and stimulate emesis either directly or indirectly through the CTZ . Activation of the VC produces efferent impulses that travel from the VC to the abdominal muscles, salivation center, cranial nerves and respiratory center, causing vomiting . The main approach to the control of emesis has been to identify the active neurotransmitters (Figure 1.2) and their receptors in the CNS and the GI tract that mediate the afferent inputs to the VC . The receptors associated with serotonin and substance P are 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT) and neurokinin-1 (NK-1), respectively . The study of these serotonin and substance P receptors has guided the development of antagonists, with relative success in controlling emesis (Table 1.1) (also see Chapter 3) . Despite some reduction of nausea after treatment with 5HT and NK-1 receptor antagonists (RAs), it remains a problem, suggesting other pathways may be important in controlling nausea . Dopamine RAs have been shown to have some efficacy in the treatment of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy . Agents that may affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), histaminic and muscarinic receptors are also being investigated with a view to developing additional effective antiemetic drugs . Dopaminergic, histaminic and muscarinic receptors may be some of the receptors involved in the control of nausea .","It is estimated that 80-100% of patients receiving chemotherapy without antiemetic prophylaxis will experience some level of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

9781910797723,chp4,"Recent years have seen unparalleled advances in the clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) . CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 therefore represent attractive therapeutic targets where checkpoint inhibition by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) helps activate T-cell function to uncover and attack cancer cells . Ipilimumab (Yevoy ®, BMS) and tremelimumab (AstraZeneca) are antibodies targeting CTLA-4 that have reached Phase III trials, but to date only ipilimumab has been approved by the FDA as adjuvant therapy, in patients with melanoma . Many more trials are under way or recently completed, including studies in other tumor types, and metastatic, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment settings, and studies of combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with systemic therapies, including chemotherapy, other targeted agents and radiotherapy . The experience gained in this setting indicates that traditional endpoints, such as response rates and median progression-free and overall survival, do not reflect the true value of treatment with checkpoint inhibitors: more important is the percentage of patients surviving long term without active malignancy, the so called 'tail of the curve' . The PD-1 targeting antibodies are more active than the CTLA-4 targeting agents, but combinations of the two increase long-term survival rates, albeit with increased toxicity . Single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs have consistently shown improvements in median survival of approximately 3 months compared with chemotherapy in patients receiving second-line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) . Studies comparing nivolumab or pembrolizumab with chemotherapy as first-line therapy have shown conflicting results, probably because of differences in patient selection between trials . Compared with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab produced higher response rates (45% versus 28%), a 4-month improvement in median progression-free survival (10 versus 6 months) and better overall survival at 6 months (80% versus 72%) in patients with 50% or more tumor expression of PD-L1 . Improved response and survival rates, compared with standard therapies, have been seen in randomized trials of pembrolizumab and nivolumab as second-line treatment for urothelial and renal cell cancers, respectively . However, 26-50% of patients with high microsatellite instability (MSI-high) colorectal cancer responded to checkpoint inhibitors in Phase II trials, but with evidence of protracted responses; Phase III trials are under way . A large Phase II study of avelumab in 88 patients with stage IV Merkel cell cancer that had progressed after chemotherapy showed a response rate of 32%, including eight complete responses . Toxicities are more common with combinations of a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor with a CTLA-4 targeted agent than with monotherapies . Grade 3/4 toxicities have been reported in fewer than 3% of patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; 9% treated with ipilimumab monotherapy, but 19% of patients who received combination therapy . Skin toxicities, including pruritus and rash, occur in 14-22% (grade 3/4 in < 1%) of PD-1 mAb-treated patients, 15-35% of ipilimumab-treated patients (grade 3/4 in 1-2%) and 28-33% of patients receiving combination therapy (grade 3/4 2-3%) . Fatigue occurs in 15-34% of patients receiving single-agent therapy and 35% of those receiving combination treatment, among whom it may be severe in up to 4% .","Immune checkpoints are cell surface receptors that are expressed on activated T cells and other immune cells, which normally serve a co-inhibitory role in keeping the adaptive immune system in check to prevent autoimmune diseases. Immune checkpoints may be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies, resulting in T-cell activation and an immune response against cancer. This is analogous to releasing the brakes to accelerate a fast car. Immune checkpoint inhibitors against CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1 have produced durable tumor shrinkage and prolonged survival in patients with a variety of solid tumors. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with melanoma, lung cancers, head and neck cancers, bladder cancers, kidney cancers, colorectal cancers, MSI-high solid tumors, Merkel cell cancers and Hodgkin's lymphoma. These include ipilimumab (CTLA-4 mAb), nivolumab, pembrolizumab (PD-1 mAbs), atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab (PD-L1 mAbs). Clinical trials are ongoing for additional indications, as well as various combination therapies. Immune-related adverse events are due to autoimmune inflammation resulting from overactivation of T cells; they include colitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, thyroiditis and pneumonitis."
9781910797693,chp4,"The study design, endpoints, and patient population in a clinical comparability study of a biosimilar drug may differ from those in the original trial of the reference product, although the EMA recommends that some of the endpoints used for the reference product are included to support the comparability exercise . BI 695501 was approved for the same indications as Humira by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2017, following submissions to the EMA and FDA in January 2017, as Cyltezo™ (adalimumab-adbm), supported by a comprehensive data package comprising analytical, preclinical and clinical development studies . In the USA, the first copies of biologic reference drugs were approved through a comparability pathway as complex generics - human growth hormone Omnitrope® (Sandoz) in 2006 and Enoxaparin- M-Enoxaparin TM (Momenta/Sandoz) in 2010 . Further biosimilar approvals then stalled until new legislation was passed to create a separate biosimilars approval pathway; one section of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act permitted biosimilars but also potentially delayed their market entry by extending data exclusivity for original reference drugs to 12 years and creating controversial disclosure requirements on biosimilar makers . Further data may be required in order to demonstrate comparability if, for example, the drug has multiple sites of action, particularly if these have different relevance in different indications, or if there are differences between indications in terms of efficacy, safety or immunogenicity . Although clinical data are an important part of the regulatory review for a biosimilar, comparability with the reference drug based on non-clinical studies is an inherent part of the biosimilar pathway . The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) indicates whether indications have been approved on the basis of extrapolation or data from comparative clinical studies . The FDA approved CT-P13 as a biosimilar in 2016, for the same indications, based on review of evidence that included structural and functional characterization, animal study data, human pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics data, clinical immunogenicity data, and other clinical safety and effectiveness data that demonstrated CT-P13 to be biosimilar to Remicade . The manufacture of 'intended copy' biologics (defined on page 14) in countries where robust regulatory pathways have not been established may address an unmet health need but presents risks - such medicines, while clinically active, may not be close enough to the originator molecule to be judged biosimilar in analytical or clinical testing . The problem with intended copy biologics is that they have neither the security of biosimilarity studies nor large volumes of clinical data to predict their safety and efficacy . For example, an intended copy of rituximab (MabThera ®) called rituximab-Reditux ® was approved for use in India in 2007 via an abbreviated pathway, on the basis of a single-arm pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy, and safety study in 71 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . Clinical studies are required for additional indications if the approved indications have different mechanisms of action (MOA) or mechanisms of toxicity (MOT) that could suggest a potential risk to drug safety or efficacy .","The evidence required for approval of biosimilars is greater than that for generic versions of small molecule drugs. The 'biosimilar pathway' developed by the European Medicines Agency follows the principles that apply following a change to manufacturing of a biologic. Central to the pathway is the demonstration that there are no significant clinical differences between a biosimilar and its reference biologic, based on analytical, preclinical and clinical data. Based on this, and demonstration that the mechanism of action is the same in different conditions, the biosimilar will be approved for the same indications as the reference biologic - known as extrapolation. 'Intended copy' biologics manufactured in countries with less stringent regulation than the EU and USA may not be true biosimilars and clinical equivalence cannot be assumed. Safety monitoring in the EU over the 10 years since the introduction of biosimilars has not identified any relevant difference in the nature, severity or frequency of adverse effects between biosimilars and their reference medicines. While the safety data for a biosimilar may be limited at launch, comparability studies mean that the range and severity of potential adverse events can be predicted from the experience with the originator reference biologic gained over many years of clinical use. Biosimilars are subject to the same pharmacovigilance as their reference biologic, including special report requirements (black triangle; risk minimization plan)."
9781908541062,ch_10,"In the last 12 years, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have both approved five TNF antagonists for the treatment of RA: etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab and certolizumab pegol (Figure 9.1) . After being shed from the cell surface, TNF molecules aggregate into trimolecular complexes that subsequently bind receptors on a variety of cells, including fibroblasts, leukocytes and endothelial cells . Additionally, TNF induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) and stimulates the release of several other pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-8 . Infliximab is a chimeric anti-TNF mAb, administered by intravenous infusion . Infliximab is currently recommended for use only with concomitant methotrexate therapy, at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 8 weeks, following three 'loading' infusions at weeks 0, 2 and 6 . In addition to improvements in inflammation and joint damage, patients receiving TNF inhibitors also report important reductions in fatigue and malaise with significant quality-of-life benefits . Not all RA patients respond to TNF antagonists and, at present, there are no factors that reliably predict effectiveness . According to some (but not all) registry data, anti-TNF agents may further increase the risk, particularly with regard to skin and soft tissue, bone and joint, lung and opportunistic infections . Other adverse events from anti-TNF therapies include local injection-site reactions (with subcutaneously administered agents) and systemic infusion reactions with infliximab, which may relate to the development of neutralizing antiglobulins and be associated with loss of effect . Despite initial concerns there is, as yet, no evidence that anti-TNF agents increase the risk of malignancy or lymphoma in RA patients, with the possible exception of non-melanoma skin cancers . Overall, its effectiveness is less than TNF antagonists and other biological therapies . Rituximab depletes circulating B cells and produces therapeutic benefit in RA similar to that achieved with TNF antagonists . It is approved for treatment of RA patients for whom anti-TNF therapy has failed . Emerging data suggest that rituximab is more effective in RA patients with circulating autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor [RF] and/or anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies [ACPA]) . Clinical trials have demonstrated abatacept to be effective in RA patients with early disease as well as in disease refractory to methotrexate and TNF blockade . Tocilizumab is a humanized anti IL-6 receptor (Il-6R) mAb that neutralizes the effects of IL-6 . Several phase III trials have demonstrated clinical efficacy in RA patients at all disease stages, from early disease to anti-TNF failure . There is no evidence for enhanced vascular events in patients receiving tocilizumab, although this is an area of continuing research with several biological therapies . Biological therapies have provided a major boost to our therapeutic options in RA, but there remains a significant research agenda surrounding their use . Now that we have nine biological therapies approved to treat RA, our major challenge over the next several years will be directed towards how to best use these in individual patients . Biological therapies are produced from living cells rather than by chemical synthesis and, generally, are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or soluble derivatives of cell surface receptors .","Nine biological therapies are now licensed for the treatment of RA. These block cytokines or their receptors (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin [IL]-1 and IL-6), deplete B cells or interfere with T cell activation. Biologics are expensive drugs, produced from living cells, that require parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) administration. They slow joint damage more effectively than traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients vary in their response to biologics, presumably reflecting important inter-patient differences in disease pathogenesis and drug pharmacokinetics. Prolonged experience will be required to provide a true therapeutic ratio and an accurate economic evaluation of these drugs. A major research agenda relates to how to target these drugs to the patients who will derive most benefit from them (personalized medicine)."
9781908541277,ch_10,"Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening medical emergency characterized by frequent and/or prolonged epileptic seizures . Community-based studies in the USA suggest the incidence may be as high as 50 per 100000 people per year, peaking in children under 1 year of age and in adults over 60 years of age . Traditionally, SE is diagnosed when the patient has continuous or repeated seizure activity without regaining consciousness for more than 30 minutes . This time frame is defined on the basis of decompensatory cerebral damage after 30 minutes of seizure activity when physiological changes fail to compensate for the increase in cerebral metabolism . In practice, however, most authorities would recommend emergency antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment when a seizure has lasted more than 5-10 minutes, excluding simple febrile seizures . SE may result from a variety of causes (Table 7.1), the commonest of which include non-compliance with antiepileptic medication, consumption of alcohol, metabolic problems, acute stroke and hypoxia . Mortality and morbidity reflect the underlying cause and the physiological effects of prolonged convulsions, including hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and hyperthermia . Any delay in treatment worsens the prognosis and reduces the likelihood of stopping seizures without having to resort to general anesthesia . The importance of a coordinated effort in the treatment of convulsive SE - involving ambulance technicians, emergency medicine specialists, medical intensivists and neurological specialists - cannot be overemphasized . Most centers would initiate treatment with a benzodiazepine intravenously (most commonly lorazepam or diazepam), followed by phenytoin or fosphenytoin, or phenobarbital . If the seizure persists, the patient might be considered as having refractory SE and general anesthesia would be warranted . Some patients experience clusters of seizures (also called acute repetitive seizures) lasting from minutes to hours . Patients with frontal lobe epilepsy are particularly prone to clustering of seizures at night . Seizure clustering may occur around menstruation in women, or when patients do not take their usual AED therapy . These seizure clusters may not be defined as SE but nonetheless require therapeutic intervention . Acute treatment with a benzodiazepine such as clobazam after the first seizure can be given in an attempt to prevent further attacks . If the seizure cluster has occurred as a result of AED omission or dose reduction, reintroduction of the drug may be sufficient to abort it . During a seizure cluster, oral therapy in a child may be problematic and intravenous access is usually unavailable or difficult . Rectal diazepam administered by parents or other caregivers may be effective in this situation . The doses used in clinical studies (0.5 mg/kg for children aged 2-5 years, 0.3 mg/kg for children aged 6-11 years, 0.2 mg/kg for those over 12 years) were effective and well tolerated, and did not produce respiratory depression . Parents and caregivers must be adequately trained by knowledgeable healthcare professionals to be able to recognize seizure clusters, administer rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam, monitor the patient for potentially dangerous respiratory depression and summon emergency medical help when necessary . Excessive use of rectal diazepam can result in rebound seizures .","Status epilepticus (SE) can be convulsive or non-convulsive. Emergency treatment should be given when a convulsive seizure has lasted more than 5-10 minutes. Poor prognostic factors for SE include old age, acute symptomatic cause and long duration. Benzodiazepine administration, orally or rectally, can be useful in patients experiencing clusters of seizures. Buccal midazolam is being increasingly used in place of rectal diazepam for the treatment of seizure clusters (acute repetitive seizures)."
9783318067095,ch1,". Digital medicine describes a field concerned with the use of technologies as tools for measurement and intervention in the service of human health . Digital medicine products are driven by high-quality hardware and software products that support health research and the practice of medicine broadly, including treatment, recovery, disease prevention and health promotion for individuals and across populations (Figure 1.1) . Patients and healthcare providers are empowered with intelligent and accessible tools to address a wide range of conditions through high-quality, safe and effective measurements and data-driven interventions . In observational and interventional research, digital technologies are increasingly used in the prevention and treatment of disease and to support health promotion . Measurement products include digital biomarkers (exempli gratia using a vocal biomarker to track changes in tremor for a Parkinson's patient), electronic clinical outcome assessments (exempli gratia an electronic patient-reported outcome survey) and tools that measure adherence and safety (exempli gratia a wearable sensor that tracks falls and smart mirrors for passive monitoring in the home) . Digital therapeutics deliver evidence-based therapeutic interventions to patients that are driven by high-quality software programs to prevent, manage or treat a medical disorder or disease . Digital health products are intended to be consumer-facing rather than used in clinical care; they often do not produce the evidence necessary to support medical use . There are times when it may be appropriate to use consumer-grade tools for measurement in clinical research . Instead, we use digital medicine as the term to describe evidence-based digital products that measure and intervene, including those intended for health promotion and disease prevention . Digital medicine products are evidence-based tools that support health research and the practice of medicine . Some digital measurements are already well established in routine clinical care - ambulatory EKG monitoring, for example, is used to detect arrhythmias in cardiac patients . Digital measures are also used in clinical research to better monitor patients and more efficiently assess safety and efficacy . By combining remotely captured data into electronic medical records (EMRs), personal health records, patient portals and clinical data repositories, innovators hope to improve clinical decision-making and support data-driven medicine . Continuous digital measures may allow for the detection of safety events that would otherwise go unrecorded - for example, a wearable cardiac monitor can help reveal arrhythmia in research participants during trials of stimulant use in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) . For example, in Alzheimer's disease, digital cognitive assessments that afford more sensitive and frequent monitoring, but are not endorsed by health authorities yet, could enable better decision-making about which treatments to advance to the next phase of clinical development (Box 1.1) . Articles reviewing current and prospective wearable technologies and their progress toward clinical application and the use of medical technology in the home provide additional examples of measurement in digital medicine . In summary, the field of digital medicine applies the same rigor to the selection, development or use of digital technology for measurement and intervention that is applied to other areas of medicine .","Digital medicine is an emerging medical and scientific discipline concerned with the application of software and hardware to health through cycles of innovation and development of research-based evidence. Digital medicine products can be used for measurement and/or treatment, and in combination with existing diagnostics and therapeutics. Measurement using digital products may enable more continuous, more precise and less biased information than traditional means of measurement in medicine. These measurement advantages are applicable in clinical care and in the conduct of clinical research, where such measurements can be used as clinical endpoints or for other measurement and monitoring purposes such as establishing eligibility for a trial or detecting adverse effects of a treatment under study."
9783318068207,hh-4,"Circulating free DNA is, in general, high quality, though it is often fragmented because of cleavage prior to release from cell nuclei; large fragments (more than 200 bp) are therefore less likely to be successfully sequenced . Sequencing platforms analyzing both DNA strands negate such errors . Those platforms utilized for sequencing very short fragments may miss large deletions (more than 20 bp) . Third-generation sequencing methods, also termed large-fragment single-molecule sequencing, aim to sequence long DNA and RNA molecules . Pacific Biosystems has developed a method that, although it requires library construction, detects single nucleotides during incorporation into a new strand using immobilized, specifically modified polymerase enzymes . Nanopore systems for DNA sequencing are being developed as a fourth-generation technology . These include biological membrane systems and solid-state technology and could potentially offer low-cost DNA and RNA sequencing and genotyping . Illumina and Ion Torrent are the major commercially available sequencing platforms utilizing the short-read technology; the other two - 454 Life Sciences and SOLiD (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection) - are not widely used nowadays . NGS can be utilized to sequence the entire genome (WGS), with all coding (exon) and non-coding (introns, promoters, regulatory and structural elements) regions evaluated . Sequencing involves a common workflow, from DNA extraction, to library preparation, target enrichment, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis . Adapters may include molecular barcodes (to allow for pooling of patient samples), a sequence recognized by universal PCR primers, hybridization sequences to bind the DNA fragments to a surface, and recognition sites to initiate sequencing . The term library refers to these DNA fragments with flanking adapters that are ready for sequencing . The resulting library undergoes enrichment for specific regions of interest for whole-exome analysis and/or targeted sequencing of specific genes . DNA molecules of around 500 bp, with appropriate adapters ligated to each end, are utilized as substrates for repeated amplification reactions on a solid substrate that contains complementary oligonucleotide sequences . This is based on the simple principle that an H + is generated when the correct nucleotide is incorporated across from its complementary base in a propagating DNA sequence . Initially, the DNA fragments (200-1500 bp), ligated to adapters, are attached to a bead of complementary sequences and then amplified by emulsion PCR (emPCR) . Thereafter, once the sequencing reagents enter the wells, if the appropriate nucleotide is incorporated, an H + is released, the voltage spike occurs and is detected and a signal is recorded . Sanger sequencing is a very accurate method of sequencing that can analyze relatively large DNA fragments . All NGS platforms capture the individual sequences of millions of molecules, while standard sequencing methods (Sanger sequencing) deliver a net signal derived from a pool of molecules, a collective sequence . As NGS sequences multiple fragments, multiple times, it has higher sensitivity and can therefore detect variants that occur at lower frequencies . NGS is far more rapid and also cheaper for sequencing multiple targets than standard methods .","Sanger sequencing, although groundbreaking, is labor intensive, time consuming and expensive, and hence it has been replaced with NGS. The two major methods for NGS use the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms. Illumina uses fluorescently tagged nucleotides while Ion Torrent detects a pH (voltage) change on nucleotide binding. It is vital that the results of NGS are considered in a clinical context. A result from an inadequate sample should not be interpreted as a negative result. Methods of single-molecule sequencing, although relatively error prone, have utility in the sequencing of large variants and transcript isoforms."
9781908541796,chapter6,"Indolent lymphoma (also known as low-grade lymphoma) is generally considered to be incurable and treatment is used to reduce systemic symptoms or debulk a high tumor burden . Follicular lymphoma is a common, usually nodal, lymphoma with a relatively high rate of transformation to high-grade disease (Table 6.1) . Thus, the finding of BCL-2+ abnormal lymphocytes within expanded lymph-node follicles is strong evidence for the specific diagnostic translocation and therefore the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma . One of the many difficulties in managing follicular lymphoma is its uncertain prognosis: some patients survive for more than 10 years, while others die within 2 or 3 years of presentation . Most low-grade lymphomas are remarkably radiosensitive, so this may be the treatment of choice for patients with localized disease . Patients whose disease is refractory to first-line therapy will require a second-line treatment, such as CHOP or a fludarabine-containing regimen; the addition of rituximab may also be beneficial . Follicular lymphoma is an indolent slowly progressive disease, and the so-called 'watch and wait' approach is entirely reasonable in asymptomatic patients with stage III or IV disease with low tumor burden . For advanced stages with a high tumor burden or patients with systemic symptoms, the combination of rituximab and chemotherapy has become standard frontline treatment - usually R-CVP, although some centers prefer R-CHOP . Although no data are yet available on the effect of rituximab maintenance therapy on overall survival, 2 years of rituximab maintenance therapy after successful initial R-chemotherapy is broadly considered a new standard for first-line treatment of patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma . Therefore, those patients who have been exposed to two or more chemotherapy regimens, and those with rapidly progressing disease, should be considered for experimental procedures such as high-dose therapy with stem-cell rescue, or allografting with reduced-intensity conditioning (see pages 115-18) . There is emerging evidence that high-dose therapy with stem-cell rescue may result in prolonged remissions and many centers use this approach for patients who undergo high-grade transformation or whose remissions are short with standard regimens . Staging investigations usually reveal widespread disease involving the spleen, bone marrow and, not uncommonly, abnormal circulating cells in the blood . For younger patients, who are otherwise well, there is increasing evidence that intensive chemotherapy treatments, such as HyperCVAD-MA or Mega CHOP (intensive CHOP regimen), alternating with high-dose cytarabine, followed by high-dose therapy and stem-cell transplantation, produce improved results compared with R-CHOP . A subset of patients with mantle cell lymphoma present more like an indolent lymphoma - they frequently have a peripheral blood lymphocytosis, splenic and marrow involvement, but minimal, if any, lymphadenopathy . extranodal marginal zone lymphoma or lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), which typically involves sites such as the stomach, lung, salivary gland and thyroid . Marginal zone lymphomas are strongly associated with autoimmune disorders (exempli gratia Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Sjögren's syndrome) and bacterial infection; both represent some form of chronic antigenic stimulation . Patients with more aggressive disease or those that undergo high-grade transformation require combination immunochemotherapy such as R-CHOP . Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/CLL is the most common low-grade B-cell lymphoma (Table 6.5) .","Low-grade B-cell lymphomas are more common in the elderly and treatment is usually aimed at alleviating symptoms rather than curing the disease. Some low-grade lymphomas, such as follicular and mantle cell lymphomas, have characteristic immunophenotypes and cytogenetics that enable clear diagnosis. Other low-grade lymphomas are hard to diagnose definitively because of the lack of specific markers (exempli gratia marginal zone and lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma). Knowledge of the cause of the lymphoma has in some cases led to improved treatments (exempli gratia Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma)."
9781908541666,ch_3,"Early detection of diabetes is critical, as appropriate treatment will prevent the complications of diabetes and the significant burden this places on an individual's quality of life, morbidity and mortality . Early detection of impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance allows early intervention with appropriate lifestyle change and can defer and even prevent the onset of diabetes . The diagnosis of diabetes has changed progressively over the last couple of decades; criteria have become simplified and now recognize that diabetic complications occur with glucose levels previously considered normal . The current diagnostic cut-offs are listed in Table 2.1 and reflect the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines of 2013 . Fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) is generally diagnostic of diabetes mellitus . Random glucose > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is also diagnostic in a patient with polyuria, polydipsia or unexplained weight loss . These cut-offs establish the diagnosis of diabetes, after which it is left to the clinician to consider and determine the cause or type of diabetes . It is now recognized that a fasting glucose level between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L (100-125 mg/dL) is 'prediabetic' . Glucose tolerance should be formally tested when glucose levels fall short of diagnostic cut-offs and the patient is considered 'at-risk' (Table 2.2) . Cut-offs are given in Table 2.1: essentially a 2-hour glucose response > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is diagnostic of diabetes and < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) considered normal . The glucose tolerance test is a useful provocation test that can be used for early detection of diabetes in the at-risk patient (see Table 2.2) . It is also diagnostically useful in women with impaired fasting glucose (fasting glucose 5.6-6.9 mmol/L [100-125 mg/dL]), for whom the fasting glucose test is less sensitive for diabetes . Similarly, repeat testing is not appropriate for the unwell patient found to be hyperglycemic with sepsis, acute infection or acute myocardial infarction, or post-transplantation, for whom treatment of both the acute underlying illness and associated hyperglycemia is indicated . A value less than 6.5% does not exclude diabetes diagnosed using glucose tests . Therefore, in these patients, the best time to screen is with a random glucose level between 15:00 and 17:00 hours . Similarly, it may be relatively clear cut in the obese middle-aged person with multiple family members who have lifestyle- or tablet-managed type 2 diabetes . It may appear identical to type 2 diabetes but be difficult to manage with standard oral medications, with patients progressing to insulin therapy . Recent studies show that early instigation of insulin therapy in this diabetes subgroup is associated with better glycemic control than use of sulfonylureas; a large randomized study is currently under way . To distinguish LADA from type 2 diabetes, detection of serum autoimmune antibodies is useful, specifically glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies and cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies (ICA) . Antibody testing should be considered if the individual with diabetes has any of the following features . strong family history of diabetes without obesity for which insulin therapy was required .","Screening for diabetes should be undertaken annually with a fasting glucose level. Always consider diabetes mellitus in high-risk populations, including those with a family history, the obese, corticosteroid recipients and transplantation recipients."
9781908541406,ch_12,"The platelet count declines by 10% in pregnancy, partly as a result of the increase in plasma volume . Although the platelet count declines in normal pregnancy, a fall below the lower limit of normal (150 x 10 /L) is uncommon . It is usually diagnosed by excluding other causes of a reduced platelet count (exempli gratia disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC]) . Pre-existing primary immune thrombocytopenia may be exacerbated during pregnancy, and the platelet count declines further to a level at which specific treatment may be required . The condition may also first present in pregnancy with a platelet count of less than 100 x 10 /L on routine blood examination, or with bleeding symptoms, which usually only occur when the platelet count is less than 20 x 10 /L . As in the non-pregnant state, it is important to exclude other causes of thrombocytopenia (see Chapter 4) and, in particular, to ensure that the patient does not have a primary bone marrow disorder (exempli gratia acute leukemia) . The antiplatelet antibody responsible for primary immune thrombocytopenia may cross the placenta; the cord blood platelet count of all babies born to mothers with this condition should therefore be checked . The risk of fetal bleeding during labor is extremely small, even with severe thrombocytopenia, and it is therefore inappropriate to obtain an antenatal platelet count by fetal blood sampling before or during labor . Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is an uncommon condition in which maternal immunization results from small fetomaternal bleeds . One of the other features of pregnancy-induced hypertension is activation of the coagulation system and thrombocytopenia possibly arising secondary to endothelial damage . If the DIC is severe with a fibrinogen level of less than 1 g/L and platelet count lower than 50 x 10 /L, it may be necessary to give blood products (see DIC below) . The fibrinogen level rises progressively during pregnancy and may be 4-6 g/L by delivery . If the patient is bleeding, it is necessary to give appropriate blood products in an attempt to restore coagulation and platelet count (see Chapter 12 Diagnosis and Treatment) . In the absence of hemorrhage, blood products such as cryoprecipitate are only necessary if the fibrinogen level is less than 1 g/L and the platelet count lower than 50 x 10 /L to cover delivery . Women who are known, or suspected, to be carriers of congenital bleeding disorders, exempli gratia hemophilia, require specialist counseling, investigation and management by multidisciplinary teams . The mother might have a reduced level of the affected clotting factor and thus a bleeding disorder potentially leading to severe postpartum hemorrhage . During pregnancy the FVIII level usually rises to within the normal range but monitoring is essential . Von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels generally rise during pregnancy, and bleeding is uncommon in patients with von Willebrand disease before delivery . If thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia are discovered, it is likely that platelets, fibrinogen and fresh frozen plasma will be required to control bleeding .","In pregnancy, it is important to be aware of the complications that may be associated with severe coagulation disturbance (exempli gratia pregnancy-associated hypertension) and to monitor the blood count and coagulation screen in these patients. Before attributing a platelet count of 100 x 10 /L or less to the benign condition of gestational thrombocytopenia of pregnancy, other causes of a reduced platelet count should be excluded. In primary immune thrombocytopenia, the platelet count tends to fall as pregnancy progresses and treatment may be necessary to maintain it above about 50 x 10 /L. After delivery, the platelet count in the neonate should be monitored for about a week as it can fall profoundly in the first few days of life."
9781908541963,chapter4,"Medications appear to be the cause of 50% of cases of acute liver failure in the USA, and as pharmacotherapy advances the treatment of many disorders, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) may also rise . Unfortunately, other than the use of N -acetylcysteine for paracetamol (acetominophen)-induced hepatotoxicity (see below), there are no specific 'antidotes' for DILI . Specific medications typically produce a specific and reproducible pattern of liver injury, referred to as the hepatotoxicity profile of the drug . Predictable or direct DILI usually promptly follows an exposure to a new medication and appears to be due to direct toxicity or a toxic metabolite . Nevertheless, elevation of the aminotransferases (greater than three times normal) occurs in approximately 1% of exposed patients . The abnormalities are generally not progressive and may resolve despite continued use of the drug . Nevertheless, if significant persistent elevations in liver tests occur, the statin should be discontinued . Starting a different statin once the liver abnormalities have resolved, and monitoring the patient's liver tests for a period, is appropriate . A common clinical question is whether to use a statin in a patient with pre-existing liver disease . Thus, it is probably acceptable to use the statins in patients with chronic stable liver disease, provided symptoms and liver tests are monitored . Statins are contraindicated in patients with acute liver disease and those with advanced chronic liver disease (elevated bilirubin, depressed albumin, clinically apparent cirrhosis, etc . Lower doses, typically used without suicidal intent, can induce severe liver injury in patients who chronically use alcohol or who are malnourished . Although non-specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and malaise are common within a few hours, patients typically have little evidence of liver injury until 24-48 hours after ingesting injurious amounts of paracetamol . For those who survive, recovery is usually prompt and complete and with no long-term sequelae to acute paracetamol liver injury . The potential for hepatotoxicity following ingestion can be calculated using the Rumack-Matthew paracetamol nomogram (Figure 4.1) . It is therefore imperative that N -acetylcysteine is given early (typically while awaiting paracetamol serum levels) and continued if significant hepatotoxicity has developed . Isoniazid should be continued and the patient monitored for symptoms and worsening liver tests . Often the liver test abnormalities will resolve despite continuing isoniazid . Clinically evident isoniazid hepatitis, the second and much more serious form, is rare, occurring in less than 1% of treated patients . About half of patients with clinical isoniazid hepatitis will develop symptoms within a few months of starting the drug, although presentations after as long as 12 months have been reported . At a minimum, patients who start taking isoniazid should be educated to recognize and report any symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction . The US Centers for Disease Control recommend liver tests before treatment and then periodically during treatment only in patients at high risk for hepatotoxicity (Table 4.2) . Others, reasoning that concomitant use of other drugs with hepatotoxic potential (rifampicin [rifampin] and pyrazinamide) is so common, recommend liver tests at regular intervals .","Drug-induced liver injury is common and usually mild. Determining the temporal relationship between starting a drug and the development of symptoms and signs of liver disease is important. Discontinuation of offending agents usually results in prompt resolution of hepatic injury. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity may be appropriate for some medications, such as statins and isoniazid."
9781908541062,ch_2,"The synovial membrane intima is just one or two cell layers thick and contains two major cell types: type A synoviocytes, which bear macrophage markers, and type B synoviocytes, which have fibroblastic characteristics . The matrix of the intima is rich in proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, in particular hyaluronic acid . The subintima is a loose vascular connective tissue stroma containing blood vessels, lymphatics and nerve endings within a matrix comprising varying proportions of lipid, collagen fibrils and more organized fibrous tissue . The synovial membrane secretes lubricating and nourishing synovial fluid, a viscous fluid containing a high concentration of hyaluronic acid . As well as providing an osmotic force within the synovial cavity, hyaluronic acid contributes to the lubricating properties of synovial fluid although other constituents are also important . Articular cartilage comprises chondrocytes embedded in a hydrated matrix composed of collagen, proteoglycans and other matrix proteins . It is an avascular structure lacking lymphatics, and the synovial fluid is critical for providing nutrients to this tissue . These cells are critical to the integrity of articular cartilage because they synthesize collagen, proteoglycans and also other components such as fibronectin . Each cell is surrounded by a zone of secreted proteoglycans and a basket-like mantle of fibrillar collagen, but the highest collagen content occurs in the more distal intercellular matrix . Collagens are fibrillar proteins that, together with proteoglycans, account for the biomechanical properties of articular cartilage . The predominant collagen in articular cartilage is type II, constituting approximately 90% in the adult, with types IX and XI contributing most of the remainder . The largest family of proteoglycans in articular cartilage is the aggrecans, which contain abundant chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate side-chains . The ratio of collagen to aggrecan is high in the superficial layers of articular cartilage and drops progressively toward the subchondral bone . During load-bearing, water and solutes are squeezed out of aggrecan, which increases the relative proteoglycan concentration, providing an osmotic drive to rehydration once the load is removed . In disease states such as RA, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) reduce synthesis and increase catabolism of articular cartilage, leading to rapid breakdown . The basal layer of articular cartilage is calcified and is attached directly to subchondral bone, which has a similar structure . This provides bone with both tensile and compressive strength . The remaining bone matrix is made up of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronic acid, and proteins such as osteocalcin; as in articular cartilage, these are incorporated into macromolecular complexes . Glycoproteins such as osteopontin, osteonectin and bone sialoproteins function as anchoring molecules, bridging matrix constituents such as collagen to bone cells . Bone contains two major cell types: osteoblasts and osteoclasts . Mesenchymal osteoblasts are critical for the synthesis of collagen and bone matrix (osteoid) . Therefore, in addition to mechanical forces, stimuli to bone formation and breakdown include circulating hormones and vitamins, such as parathyroid hormone, thyroid hormone, vitamin D, calcitonin and sex hormones (Figure 1.3) .","The joint is a complex organ composed of a number of specialized tissues. Dysregulation within any one of the tissues within the joint may precipitate specific pathologies, such as osteoarthritis or osteoporosis. In rheumatoid arthritis, the primary pathological target is the synovial membrane."
9781908541024,ch_5,"Symptomatic management can result in a significant improvement in quality of life for patients with brain metastases . Vasogenic edema secondary to metastases typically responds to treatment with corticosteroids within a matter of hours . Eliminating doses given late in the day and minimizing multiple daily doses may help to limit the side effects . Standard therapy for a patient with newly diagnosed brain metastasis remains whole-brain radiotherapy . About 50% of patients die from progressive neurological disease; the remainder die as a result of systemic tumor progression . Aggressive focused management of brain metastases may improve the prognosis for some patients . These results, while encouraging, have been obtained in highly selected patient populations, most of whom had a high Karnofsky performance status, limited systemic tumor burden and small brain metastases . Second, the optimal timing of whole-brain radiotherapy following surgical resection or stereotactic radiosurgery is unclear . While early whole-brain radiotherapy improves local control, there is no clear survival benefit . Use of chemotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases is generally disappointing . Unfortunately, by the time most patients develop brain metastases, they have already been exposed to the most effective chemotherapeutic agents and the metastatic clones are relatively chemoresistant . In spite of this, chemotherapy may be useful in treating some individuals with brain metastases . In particular, patients with brain metastases from small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer or choriocarcinoma may have a better than average response to chemotherapy . Chemotherapy or radiosensitizing agents may be combined with whole-brain radiotherapy in an attempt to improve the outcome compared with either modality alone . A European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) study found a significant survival advantage for patients with small-cell lung cancer treated with teniposide in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy, when compared with teniposide alone . Similarly, a significant improvement in radiographic response was seen in patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases who were treated with temozolomide in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy, when compared with whole-brain radiotherapy alone . Finally, chemotherapy may be useful in the setting of recurrent brain metastases . At recurrence, most patients have multiple lesions that are not amenable to radiosurgery or focal therapy . Improvements in therapy for systemic cancer have increased the number of patients living long enough to develop symptomatic brain metastases . In particular, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive (Her2+) breast cancer patients with systemic disease controlled with trastuzumab appear to have an increased risk of developing brain metastases . Thus, the development of new strategies to prevent and treat brain metastases is increasingly important . Approximately 1 in 4 patients with cancer will develop a brain metastasis; patients with melanoma, lung or breast cancer are at the greatest risk (Table 4.1) . Patients with a new diagnosis of brain metastasis should be systemically restaged as appropriate for their primary tumor . The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has delineated specific prognostic categories for patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases (Table 4.2) . A treatment algorithm for newly diagnosed brain metastasis is shown in Figure 4.4 .","Improvements in therapy for systemic cancer have resulted in an increase in the number of patients living long enough to develop symptomatic brain metastasis. It is likely that this trend will continue. Therefore, new strategies to prevent and treat brain metastases will become increasingly important. Patients with a new diagnosis of brain metastasis should be systemically restaged as appropriate for their primary tumor. Although the average prognosis for an individual with brain metastasis is poor, selected patients will benefit significantly from aggressive local therapy or judicious use of chemotherapy."
9781908541406,ch_8,"Hemophilia A and B are the most common severe congenital bleeding disorders and result from a deficiency of coagulation factor (F)VIII and FIX, respectively . Some female carriers of the hemophilic gene, however, have reduced plasma levels of FVIII and FIX, and consequently have a mild bleeding disorder . The risk of bleeding is directly related to the plasma levels of FVIII and FIX (Table 6.1); individuals with levels below 1 IU/dL (< 1% of normal) bleed the most frequently and are categorized as having 'severe' hemophilia . It is important to do this, because the clinical features are related to the mutation (exempli gratia the likelihood of an anti-FVIII antibody developing following treatment is higher with certain mutations), and because it makes identification of female carriers in the family much more straightforward . If the mother is a known carrier, or there is a family history of hemophilia, male infants can be tested for hemophilia at birth by measuring the plasma levels of FVIII or FIX from cord blood . For individuals not diagnosed at birth, the age at which the patient clinically presents with a bleed will usually depend on the severity of the hemophilia . Many bleeds in patients with severe hemophilia are apparently 'spontaneous', without a history of trauma, and occur as often as once or twice a week . Boys with moderate (1-5% factor levels) or mild (> 5%) hemophilia usually present with bleeding episodes later, the age depending on the FVIII or FIX level . Bleeding often begins insidiously and may have been occurring for some time before discomfort is noticed; as a result, a patient may eventually present with a large hematoma . In an undiagnosed patient with hemophilia, bleeding may not be excessive during an operation, but persistent oozing over several days leads to a large hematoma . Once bleeding has started, it is important to raise the level of FVIII or FIX promptly to arrest hemorrhage (Table 6.2) . In some patients with mild hemophilia, desmopressin, 0.3 µg/kg (max 20 μg), is capable of increasing FVIII to the necessary level, thereby avoiding the use of a clotting factor concentrate (see Chapter 5) . In many patients who develop inhibitors, it is possible to induce tolerance to FVIII by giving regular daily infusions of this clotting factor, even in the absence of bleeding, and the antibody becomes undetectable after 6-12 months . In the 1970s, it became apparent that patients were being infected with hepatitis viruses from the pooled clotting factor concentrates prepared from the plasma of many thousands of blood donations . From the late 1970s until 1986, HIV contaminated clotting factor concentrates, which resulted in the infection of many patients . Acquired hemophilia is an uncommon autoimmune condition in which antibodies are formed against the patient's own FVIII; this reduces the plasma level substantially to levels usually in the range of 0-10% . Treatment depends on the level of the inhibitory antibody and the severity of the bleeding; recombinant FVIIa and activated prothrombin complex concentrates are generally more effective than FVIII and desmopressin .","Repeated hemarthroses lead to joint destruction and it is therefore important to treat every bleed early and effectively. Children with severe hemophilia should be treated with regular prophylactic injections of factor (F)VIII or FIX concentrate to prevent bleeding and preserve joint function. All licensed concentrates of FVIII and FIX, purified from pooled blood donor plasma, are virally attenuated, do not transmit HIV or hepatitis C virus and are safe and effective therapies. Recombinant clotting factor concentrates are being used increasingly as they are virally safe and equally effective. Patients should be tested regularly for the presence of inhibitors, and any patient who does not respond clinically to treatment with factor concentrate should be immediately tested for an inhibitory antibody. In mild hemophilia A, desmopressin can often be effective and avoids the use of concentrate. All potential carriers of hemophilia A and B should be offered genetic counseling and, if appropriate, DNA testing to ascertain their carrier status."
9781910797587,chp05,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is usually diagnosed clinically but may require investigations to aid in differential diagnosis or in assessing the degree of structural severity . When investigating a new patient presenting with any joint problems, it is usual to try to differentiate OA from primary inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . In the small joints of the hands, findings range from minimal tenderness to marked bony enlargement and deformity, with Heberden's nodes at the distal interphalangeal joint and Bouchard's nodes at the proximal interphalangeal joints (Figure 5.4) . Observation of functional activities, especially walking, will often give a good indication of pain elicited by weight bearing and muscle weakness around the hip joint . Differentiation from lumbar spine problems may be helped by assessing the medial rotation of the hip joint with the patient sitting on a firm surface (the spine and pelvis are therefore supported and relatively fixed in this position, so that any movement elicited by the examiner is likely to be isolated to the hip joint) . Clinical assessment of the hip joint should examine full passive movement of the hip with the patient in a supine position, moving the leg into flexion, then internal rotation and external rotation of the joint with the hip and knee both flexed to 90 degrees (Figure 5.5) . Active or passive movement of the hip joint will often reproduce the patient's symptoms and it is important to ask if this is the case . In general, the diagnosis of OA is based on clinical history and examination; since this disease generally presents with symptoms, these should be addressed first . Primarily, the task force concluded that imaging is not required for the diagnosis of typical presentations of OA (id est patients over 40 years old who present with usage-related pain, short duration morning stiffness, and symptoms in one or more joints) . MRI and ultrasonography are more sensitive than clinical examination in detecting synovitis and effusions (and in distinguishing between the two), but the presence of either pathology does not usually differentiate mechanical from inflammatory arthritides . The major differential diagnosis for multiple hand small-joint pain and swelling is between RA and OA with secondary inflammation . Generally, the absence of prolonged morning stiffness and the examination findings of bony deformities suggest an OA problem, but rheumatologic opinion may be required . The commonest cause of shoulder pain in patients over the age of 55 is subacromial impingement syndrome, which includes rotator cuff pathology and/or subacromial bursitis . This may be a difficult diagnosis to make in the presence of generalized shoulder pain with associated functional disability and may require the use of radiographic or ultrasonographic imaging of the acromioclavicular joint . True mechanical locking should be distinguished from 'gelling' - in the former, patients will often describe the knee locking in mid-gait and requiring some manipulation to return joint function; in the latter (a much more common symptom), patients report that pain limits the range of motion after prolonged immobility (exempli gratia after kneeling) .",Careful history taken together with clinical examination of joints establishes most diagnoses. Imaging and laboratory investigations may occasionally aid the assessment process. Differential diagnosis from other rheumatologic conditions and inflammatory arthritides is part of the diagnostic process.
9781912776818,hh-7,"Therefore, the initial management for a patient with suspected TTP will typically involve empiric plasma exchange therapy, which should usually be started before the diagnosis is confirmed . Nearly 90% of patients will survive an acute TTP episode with plasma exchange therapy whereas, in contrast, there was near uniform mortality prior to the discovery of its effectiveness in TTP . The expected response to plasma exchange would be a gradual decline in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) followed by an increase in platelet count . A clinical response (platelet count > 150 x 10 /L) would be expected 4-6 days after starting plasma exchange therapy . An early study in which steroids were given to treat TTP suggested efficacy, but the study was done before it became feasible to measure ADAMTS13 activity . Steroid treatments are typically continued throughout plasma exchange therapy . Trials have demonstrated a faster platelet response, but, more importantly, caplacizumab has been shown to significantly decrease the exacerbation rate (recurrence of TTP in the first month after stopping plasma exchange) after the acute TTP episode . During the acute phase, complete blood count (CBC) and LDH should be monitored daily to help judge the response to immunosuppressive and plasma exchange therapy . Refractory TTP has been defined as a persistent thrombocytopenia, the lack of a sustained platelet count increment or a platelet count < 50 x 10 /L and an elevated LDH despite five plasma exchanges and steroid treatment . Treatment for refractory TTP should be tailored, based on response to initial therapy, but consideration should be given to . Patients with cTTP do not have an ADAMTS13 autoantibody that needs to be removed, and therefore plasma exchange is not required . Some individuals with cTTP may require only intermittent plasma infusions to treat acute episodes, while others may require ongoing prophylactic therapy to prevent symptoms and treat ongoing microangiopathic findings . Patients are infused daily until the platelet count recovers to normal, which may require only 1-3 days of plasma infusion . Patients with cTTP with ongoing TTP activity may need to be maintained on prophylactic plasma infusions to prevent persistent TMA findings and treat symptoms . Prophylactic plasma infusions may be administered at a dose of 10-15 mL/kg every 2-3 weeks, with changes in dosage based on symptoms and/or platelet counts and ability to handle the infusion volume . This therapy is appropriate to continue if patients benefit from improved symptoms after plasma infusion . Moreover, patients who were diagnosed by genetic testing of family members but who have never had an acute episode may need only close monitoring and not prophylactic plasma infusions . Even if the platelet count is above 150 x 10 /L, individuals may still have symptoms attributed to TTP that resolve with treatment with plasma infusions . Patients should be immediately started on plasma infusion therapy if they experience unexplained neurological findings or thrombocytopenia . Plasma infusions of 10 mL/kg are administered every 2 weeks but may be increased to 15 mL/kg based on changes in the platelet count or symptoms .","In patients presenting with a clinical picture consistent with an acute episode of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), plasma exchange should be started empirically before the diagnosis is confirmed by ADAMTS13 activity testing. Glucocorticoid therapy to suppress the production of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies is an important adjunct to plasma exchange therapy. Rituximab has an increasing role in the treatment of refractory and chronic relapsing TTP and may prevent future episodes by correcting the deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity. The development of caplacizumab as an adjunct to plasma exchange therapy has been shown to decrease the number of plasma exchange procedures required to achieve a normal platelet count and significantly decrease the risk for exacerbations of TTP. Many patients with congenital TTP require chronic plasma infusions as well as careful observations for chronic neurological and vascular complications."
9781908541062,ch_9,"NSAIDs remain one of the most frequently prescribed class of drugs in the treatment of patients with RA, at least early in the disease process . The principal benefit of COX-2 inhibitors is the production of analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects comparable with those of the non-selective NSAIDs, but with lower risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions and without prolongation of the bleeding time . Furthermore, data regarding the potential adverse cardiovascular consequences of both non-selective and COX-2 specific drugs has resulted in a significant reduction in their chronic use . Therapy is often initiated in patients with active disease while awaiting the full therapeutic effect of DMARDs . Recent clinical trials have confirmed the ability of corticosteroids to rapidly control inflammation in patients with recent-onset RA when used in combination with DMARD therapy . In contrast, corticosteroid therapy can be difficult to discontinue in established RA, and tapering should be gradual to avoid disease flares: exempli gratia 0.5-1.0 mg/day every few weeks to months . For this reason some rheumatologists prefer to use a single parenteral dose of a depot steroid preparation (exempli gratia methylprednisolone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide) when rapid control of inflammation is required . Intra-articular steroid injections are particularly useful for controlling, with minimal systemic effects, a local flare in joints that show disproportionate involvement . The adverse effects of corticosteroids limit their long-term use, especially in high doses . If bone densitometry is not readily available, most rheumatologists recommend prophylactic treatment, for example with a bisphosphonate, in any patient starting prednisone treatment and who is likely to receive a dose of 7.5 mg per day or higher for at least 6 months . In the UK, NICE recommends long-term corticosteroid use in established RA only after their potential complications have been fully discussed with the patient and all other treatment options, including biologics, have been offered . The Dutch Behandel Stratagieen (BeSt) study compared various strategies for DMARD use in early RA and concluded that combination therapy of methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, with a tapered dose of prednisone, was as effective as infliximab (see Chapter 9) plus methotrexate . Several studies have shown that a very important aspect of DMARD use is regular patient assessment (exempli gratia with a disease activity score including the 28-joint count [DAS28]), and adjustment of therapy if a target level of disease activity has not been achieved (usually low disease activity, DAS28 <= 3.2; or remission, DAS28 <= 2.6), so-called 'treating to target' . In this way inflammation is effectively suppressed, regardless of the drugs used to achieve it, with minimization of joint damage . It is essential that the patient understands that dosing is weekly and not daily, as the latter will result in potentially fatal bone marrow suppression . The concept of long-term therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids while awaiting a natural remission is no longer acceptable . Rheumatologists today initiate disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy as soon as the diagnosis of RA is secure . Early control of inflammation and the disease process is essential to minimize irreversible joint damage and functional disability .","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids provide symptomatic relief but should almost never be used in isolation. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the mainstay of pharmacological therapy, and their use in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reduces long-term irreversible joint damage. Treatment-to-target strategies, including combination DMARD therapy, rapidly suppress inflammation and minimize long-term damage and disability. DMARDs are generally safe with appropriate monitoring, but adverse events are potentially life-threatening if missed. Optimal therapy also includes access to allied health professionals such as nurse specialists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and podiatrists. The need for, and timing of, surgery requires skilled judgment. Consequently, the patient with RA is optimally managed from disease onset by a rheumatologist and their multidisciplinary team."
9781908541468,ch_6,"In the early stages of CKD, evidence of kidney damage (exempli gratia proteinuria, cysts, biopsy changes) may be seen in the presence of a normal GFR (> 60 mL/minute/1.73 m), while the later stages are characterized by greater functional impairment, with the GFR falling to below 60 mL/minute/1.73 m (Table 4.1) . This is particularly important, because much of the damage caused by CKD occurs early, when interventions may slow progressive kidney damage, prevent left ventricular hypertrophy, minimize vascular disease and improve quality of life . The incidence of CKD leading to dialysis varies worldwide; the number of patients per million population starting dialysis each year is 300 in the USA compared with 230 in Japan and 110 in the UK . The prevalence of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) also varies; in the USA, 1 in 1000 of the population are receiving treatment for ESKD (dialysis or transplantation) and, overall, the number of patients per million population is 1131 compared with 1397 in Japan, 690 in Canada, 634 in France, 530 in Australia, 498 in the UK and 223 in Poland . However, kidney failure resulting from diabetes and hypertension is potentially preventable (see Chapter 5), and many causes of glomerulonephritis can be treated if diagnosed at an early stage (see Chapter 6) . CKD usually presents with non-specific symptoms caused by kidney failure and the underlying disease, or is discovered by chance following a routine blood or urine test . Signs of CKD include skin pigmentation or excoriation, anemia, hypertension, postural hypotension, edema, left ventricular hypertrophy, peripheral vascular disease, lung crackles, pleural effusions, peripheral neuropathy and urine abnormalities (presence of blood or protein) . CKD is generally a progressive disease (Figure 4.2), though the rate of decline in kidney function varies between patients . Treatments aimed at reducing albuminuria and vigorously controlling blood pressure have been shown to slow or even halt the decline in kidney function and to reduce the vascular complications, which are the leading cause of death in CKD . Even a relatively small change in the progression of kidney failure has enormous implications both for the individual patient (quality of life declines significantly once dialysis is needed) and for governments or insurers (dialysis is expensive and even a small delay before it is necessary saves millions of dollars a year) . One of the major aims of care in patients with CKD is to minimize these complications, even if the underlying renal disease cannot be treated . Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with CKD, and cardiovascular mortality is doubled in patients with a GFR below 70 mL/minute (id est quite moderate renal impairment) . The risk factors for cardiovascular disease in CKD are summarized in Table 4.6; the risks increase as kidney function deteriorates . Osteodystrophy develops at a relatively early stage of kidney failure, when the GFR falls below 30-40 mL/minute, and all patients with ESKD develop some manifestations of bone disease . However, there is evidence to suggest that the calcium absorbed in this way may contribute to vascular calcification and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ESKD .","Chronic kidney disease is very common, especially the early stages. Early interventions can prevent a progressive decline in kidney function and complications. Blood pressure control is crucial, and very low targets should be set. Cardiovascular risk factors need aggressive management. Anemia and bone disease may require treatment before dialysis is necessary."
9781910797617,chp3,"consolidation therapy with either high-dose non-myeloablative chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) to effectively eliminate residual disease . Treatment for patients who do not achieve CR after at least two cycles of induction chemotherapy (refractory or relapsed disease) is discussed on page 45 . Midostaurin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2017 for use in combination with standard intensive chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of adults with FLT3 -mutated AML; the US label specifies use of the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay to detect the FLT3 mutation . Additional evidence of efficacy with low-dose GO plus chemotherapy had also been observed in mostly younger, favorable-risk patients, as previously reported by the Medical Research Council AML15 study (GO at 3 mg/m given during courses 1 and 3) . Repeated courses of high-dose AraC (usually three or four at monthly intervals) - alone or in combination with other drugs - has been found to be effective as consolidation therapy in the treatment of AML, particularly in the favorable-risk subset . AlloHCT is the best option in terms of reducing the risk of relapse (Table 3.3) although the benefit is somewhat offset by increased treatment-related mortality (TRM) due to complications, including graft-versus-host disease . Large prospective trials have consistently shown that alloHCT with a standard myeloablative conditioning regimen is the most effective treatment for patients with AML at CR1, with a relapse risk of 24-36% (compared with 46-61% with autoHCT or chemotherapy) . Retrospective analysis of data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) and European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) suggests that consolidation chemotherapy before alloHCT does not benefit patients with AML in CR1 . Decisions about the treatment course for individual patients are strongly influenced by cytogenetic risk, together with additional parameters such as age, comorbidities at diagnosis, white blood cell count at diagnosis, response to induction chemotherapy, and type of consolidation therapy . In the favorable-risk group, alloHCT is generally not considered in view of a TRM of 10-20%, whereas repeated cycles of high-dose non-myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy can achieve long-term DFS rates above 60%, with TRM rates below 5% (at least in younger patients) . Overall consensus is that patients with relapsed or refractory disease should receive alloHCT as part of consolidation following successful re-induction with salvage chemotherapy . Factors that predict poor response rates and poor long-term survival in this cohort of patients include: short duration of CR1 in the case of relapsed disease, complex and high-risk karyotype, increasing age and history of prior alloHCT . For patients with relapsed disease who are not fit to receive intensive salvage chemotherapy and alloHCT, treatment with hypomethylating agents can be considered, though response rates are usually less than 20% and the duration of response is only a few months in the majority of those who do respond . Options for treatment of patients with high-risk APL are many, and are typically chemotherapy plus ATRA, as was previously used in all patients, - although some clinical trials also demonstrate activity of ATRA/ATO plus gemtuzumab ozogamicin .","Historically, treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) adopted a 'one way fits all' approach, using induction chemotherapy to kill large numbers of leukemic cells. In individualized consolidation therapy, the same effect is achieved with either repeated intensive non-myeloablative chemotherapy or, for eligible patients, allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Treatment is strongly influenced by a patient's cytogenetic/molecular risk profile, and is informed by other factors, such as age, fitness and the response to induction chemotherapy; it is therefore highly individualized. Whilst the outlook for younger adults (< 60 years) has gradually improved over recent years, the outlook for older patients remains dismal. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) therapy has high cure rates but early death rates remain an issue for patients presenting with a high white blood cell count. Midostaurin inhibits several tyrosine kinases, including FLT3, which is constitutively activated in about 30% of patients with AML, usually because of an internal tandem duplication ( FLT3 -ITD). It is indicated for use in combination with standard induction chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults with FLT3 -ITD. Enasidenib inhibits aberrant isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) which catalyzes formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. IDH2 mutations occur in approximately 12% of AML patients, particularly in older adults with normal karyotype. Enasidenib is approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML with the IDH2 mutation. The anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been approved for first-line treatment of AML, following modifications to the dosage and schedule in order to address the safety concerns that arose following its initial approval. It is also approved for relapsed AML (including in pediatric patients); both indications are with a reduced fractionated dose schedule. Clinical trials focusing on small, genetically similar subsets are becoming the norm; success with molecular targeted therapies approved in 2017 is likely to herald a shift towards a more targeted, individualized approach. All patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation."
9781908541727,ch08,"Eye problems may even be the first presentation of a systemic disease or a drug's side effect . Regular retinal screening of your diabetic patients by an ophthalmologist or via an accredited retinal screening service is essential for picking up the signs of early maculopathy or proliferative retinopathy . If detected early, the progression of both of these diseases can usually be halted with appropriate treatment, and the patient's sight can be saved . The best time to detect and treat serious diabetic retinopathy is before the patient develops blurred vision . Advanced diabetic maculopathy may show microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates (yellow deposits) and major swelling of the macular retina (Figure 8.1) . Although the presence of hypertensive retinopathy is a useful indication that marked hypertension has been present for some time, it does not usually cause vision problems in itself . The only time hypertensive retinopathy results in visual symptoms is in cases of acute accelerated hypertension, which may cause severe bilateral disc swelling and macular edema, a macro-aneurysm that may leak or bleed into the retina, or arteriovenous (AV) nipping inducing retinal vein occlusions . Changes seen in mild-to-moderate hypertensive retinopathy include narrowing of the retinal arterioles and AV nipping, in which the retinal veins are focally narrowed where they are crossed by sclerosed arteries (Figure 8.4) . Changes due to severe accelerated hypertension include disc swelling, retinal hemorrhages, hard exudates and macular edema . Patients who suffer from a retinal vein occlusion usually complain of sudden loss of vision, or a sudden onset of a visual field defect that affects one eye at a time . When patients present with an eye problem that has no apparent cause, it is worth considering whether the condition could be caused by a systemic medication they are taking . Tricyclic antidepressants (exempli gratia amitriptyline) may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil and blocking the draining of aqueous humor in the eye . Symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma include severe eye pain and headache, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision and colored haloes around bright lights (see Fast Facts: Glaucoma) . Amphetamines may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil . Hydroxychloroquine in particular is a relatively safe drug and retinal toxicity is only seen in patients who receive large doses over many years . Digitalis/digoxin can cause glare symptoms, and some patients taking this medication see haloes around light . Isotretinoin (acne medication) may cause dry eyes and a sudden decrease in night vision . Side effects include sensitivity to light, changes in color vision, blurred vision and problems with night vision . Patients taking steroid eye drops should always be under the review of an ophthalmologist . Topiramate (anticonvulsant, antimigraine treatment) may cause acute angle closure glaucoma by dilating the pupil . Smoking increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the rate of its progression, which can cause serious and permanent retinal damage .","Ensure that all your diabetic patients are enrolled for regular retinal screening examinations - these can save their sight. Hypertensive patients do not require eye screening, but if they develop a vein occlusion as a complication of hypertension, urgent referral is indicated. If patients present with an eye problem that has no apparent cause, it is worth reviewing the patient's systemic medications, as a number of systemic agents may have ocular side effects."
9781912776139,ch5,"However, many individuals will present before generalized physical involvement and will undergo a battery of investigations, including blood tests, brain and spine MRI, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) to support the diagnosis and to exclude so-called 'ALS mimics', though these are rare . NCS are usually performed in conjunction with EMG to confirm LMN pathology, especially in regions of the body that do not yet show signs on examination, and to exclude other possible diagnoses . The hallmark abnormalities therefore reflect loss of the motor nerves (denervation and reinnervation on EMG and, with adequate time, a reduction in the amplitude of the compound motor action potential [CMAP]) with normal sensory function (normal sensory nerve action potentials [SNAPs]) . In ALS, these tests are primarily performed to exclude demyelination and to confirm normal sensory function . In suspected cases, NCS of multiple nerves, including those not routinely tested, should be performed with proximal stimulation, as demonstrating focal demyelination at sites atypical for entrapment is often challenging . This slowly progressive form of spinal muscular atrophy is a pure LMN disorder with prominent bulbar disease, reduced androgen sensitivity and degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia, resulting in low amplitude or absent SNAPs . However, acute and chronic denervation and reinnervation in the bulbar and thoracic paraspinal muscles is very uncommon in other conditions and, in the appropriate clinical context, has high diagnostic value for ALS (Table 5.1) . The presence of chronic denervation and reinnervation is determined with the individual gently activating the muscle being tested . This results in more muscle fibers being innervated by any one motor axon and, hence, an increase in the amplitude and duration of the MUP . Although genetic testing may form part of the diagnostic pathway for individuals with suspected ALS who have a first-degree relative with confirmed ALS or FTD, it should never supersede the clinical diagnosis . If a muscle biopsy is performed in ALS, the histopathological findings will be non-specific and consistent with chronic denervation and reinnervation . All cases require a consistent history and examination to support the diagnosis of ALS and appropriate investigations to exclude alternative diagnoses . The reclassification was made if the individual had EMG evidence of active denervation with compensatory chronic reinnervation in a body segment that did not have LMN signs on clinical examination . Hence, the separate category of laboratory-supported clinically probable ALS was removed, and individuals were categorized as definite, probable or possible according to the presence of LMN pathology, determined by either clinical examination or EMG . More importantly in terms of increasing the sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria without loss of specificity, were the modifications that expanded the electrodiagnostic definition of active denervation . For a diagnosis of ALS using any of the above criteria, evidence of chronic reinnervation must be present in the same muscle, as demonstrated by MUPs of increased amplitude, increased duration, or polyphasia, with or without reduced recruitment .","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is fundamentally a clinical diagnosis. No investigations are mandatory or independently diagnostic. Investigations are usually performed to exclude plausible alternative diagnoses and, in the case of electromyography (EMG), to improve diagnostic certainty in body regions without clinical signs. Most symptomatic individuals will have blood tests, brain and spinal MRI and neurophysiological testing during their diagnostic work up but there is risk of incidental findings that can lead to diagnostic delay. Evidence of active denervation and chronic reinnervation in multiple myotomes on EMG is supportive, but not specific, for ALS. EMG can detect subclinical lower motor neuron disease and expedite diagnosis. The El Escorial diagnostic criteria and subsequent modifications are intended for research purposes and do not predict the clinical course of the disease. The terms possible, probable and definite ALS should be avoided when counseling individuals."
9781908541963,chapter6,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a group of disorders of diverse etiology (Table 6.1) and presents as a spectrum of disease ranging from apparently innocuous deposition of fat in the liver to cirrhosis with liver failure . Once thought to be uncommon and benign, NAFLD is now recognized as one of the most common forms of serious liver disease in Western populations . The growing prevalence of disorders associated with NAFLD (particularly diabetes, obesity and hyperlipidemia) suggests that fatty liver disease will be an important cause of morbidity and even mortality in the future . Simple steatosis is the most predictable form of fatty liver disease, occurring in many patients with diabetes and/or obesity . The most advanced stages of NAFLD are marked by deposition of collagen in the liver, resulting in progressive fibrosis and eventually the architectural distortion that signifies cirrhosis . Insulin resistance plays an important role in the disease of the majority of patients with hepatic steatosis, namely those with obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia . Most patients with the early stages of NAFLD have few symptoms and are typically first identified by abnormal liver tests on routine screening . As there is no specific laboratory test for NAFLD, most practitioners make a tentative diagnosis by excluding other causes of liver disease . The possibility of drug-induced liver disease warrants attention, given that many patients take a variety of medications for disorders associated with NAFLD (diabetes, obesity and hyperlipidemia), and some of these medications have been reported to cause hepatic injury . There is currently no consensus on which patients require a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of NAFLD . Many healthcare providers feel that in the appropriate patient (id est with obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidemia), in whom other disorders have been eliminated, the diagnosis of NAFLD is likely and a biopsy would be unlikely to alter treatment . Many patients have an uneventful course; however, some will advance to end-stage liver disease and are vulnerable to all the complications of cirrhosis . Unfortunately, the comorbid conditions provoked by insulin resistance (atherosclerosis, kidney disease) make these patients relatively poor candidates for liver transplantation should they develop advancing liver failure . Genetic mutations associated with hemochromatosis result in altered regulation of iron absorption . Transferrin saturation is a better diagnostic tool than ferritin concentration, which is often elevated in inflammatory conditions and non-hemochromatosis liver disorders . Patients who are heterozygous for the C282Y mutation typically do not develop pathological iron overload . The hepatology community is divided on the need to perform a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis in patients suspected of having hemochromatosis on the basis of serum iron studies and/or genetic tests . In general, it is recommended that patients with abnormal liver blood tests or other signs of liver disease undergo liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the presence and severity of fibrosis . Patients with hemochromatosis, particularly men with fibrotic disease, are at significant risk for hepatocellular carcinoma . Definitive diagnosis rests on documenting excessive hepatic copper by liver biopsy (Table 6.6) .","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disorder, most often seen in obese or diabetic patients. NAFLD is a spectrum of conditions from simple steatosis to cirrhosis with liver failure. When associated with obesity, NAFLD is best treated with weight loss. Hemochromatosis is easily treatable but underdiagnosed. It is reasonable to screen patients at risk of hemochromatosis by measuring the transferrin saturation in early middle age."
9781908541666,ch_4,"Type 1a is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that cause immune destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans; in type 1b diabetes, such evidence is lacking . Loss of normal insulin secretion from the endocrine pancreas is caused by progressive destruction of the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans . The classic symptoms of diabetes (Table 3.1) emerge when approximately 90% of the beta cells in the islets have been destroyed . Although characteristically such symptoms have a relatively sudden onset, the initiating pathophysiological process leading to the clinical emergence of type 1 diabetes may occur over a prolonged period of time (Figure 3.1) . Although the precise cause or causes of type 1 diabetes remain to be elucidated, the best working model is that something in the environment triggers autoimmune damage in a person genetically prone to the disease (Figure 3.2) . Mumps and Coxsackie viruses may cause acute pancreatitis and Coxsackie virus infection may lead to inflammatory destruction of beta cells . Furthermore, certain chemicals such as streptozotocin, alloxan and the rat poison Vacor are directly toxic to beta cells, but it seems very unlikely that these agents have a significant role in causing the disease . Only one non-HLA gene has been generally accepted as a genetic contributor to type 1 diabetes risk, and that is the insulin gene (INS) region mapped to chromosome 11p15.5 that is now designated IDDM2 . The insulin gene is a very plausible candidate susceptibility locus, as insulin may act as an autoantigen in the immune-mediated process leading to type 1 diabetes . While there is an abundant body of evidence to suggest an autoimmune pathogenesis for type 1 diabetes, there remains an incomplete understanding of the relationship between the described genetic susceptibility to the disorder and the observed abnormal immune response secondary to a putative environmental trigger . Islet cell antibodies (ICA) are present in the serum of approximately 75% of patients at the onset of type 1 diabetes (Figure 3.4) . Islet cell constituent autoantibodies are present in 15-85% of patients around the time of disease presentation and, of these autoantibodies, the most important in detecting future type 1 diabetes are insulin autoantibodies (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA) and antibodies to insulinoma-associated autoantigen-2 (IA-2) . Much of our understanding of the mechanism of beta cell destruction has come from studies not in humans but in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse and biobreeding (BB) rat, with the former now being the favored model of type 1 diabetes . Some individuals may develop the autoimmune markers of type 1 diabetes but not go on to develop the disease; persistence of ICA, however, is associated with progressive beta cell destruction and the emergence of clinical type 1 diabetes . The autoimmune process in type 1 diabetes is associated with a decline in beta cell mass . Once beta cell destruction is advanced, C-peptide levels become undetectable although, as mentioned previously, C-peptide levels may be detectable in some patients for several months after the clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes .","Type 1 diabetes results from an absolute deficiency of insulin. Osmotic symptoms at onset include thirst, polydipsia and polyuria. Environmental factors that cause the condition are unknown, but possibly include viral infection. Multiple inherited genetic factors influence both disease susceptibility and resistance. Autoimmune processes lead to beta cell destruction and a decline in beta cell mass."
9781910797426,ch04,"Older adults with larger CBDs or with periampullary diverticula, as well as patients with recurrent or chronic biliary tract infections, may be at greater risk for developing primary stones in the bile duct . CBD stones are the most frequent cause of extrahepatic obstructive jaundice, generating an increased risk of severe complications, including acute cholangitis or pancreatitis . Symptoms and signs of concomitant acute cholangitis include pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant, jaundice and fever spikes (> 38°C) with chills (Charcot's triad) . Transabdominal ultrasound is non-invasive and is generally the first imaging modality used when a stone in the CBD is suspected . However, its sensitivity for detection of stones in the CBD is lower, about 25-80%, depending on the examiner's experience and the size of the bile duct (Figure 4.1) . Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a minimally invasive endoscopic imaging modality for CBD stones with an accuracy of around 98% (Figure 4.2) . It can be performed in a combined session with therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to achieve diagnosis and stone removal . ERCP is more invasive than other imaging modalities, with risks that include acute pancreatitis (about 5%), bleeding and perforation . When there is high suspicion for the presence of a CBD stone on the basis of symptoms, signs, laboratory tests and abdominal ultrasound, one may proceed directly to ERCP, but in general EUS or MRCP should be performed as a prelude . If there is high suspicion for CBD stones, one may proceed directly to ERCP, but again, in general, the diagnosis should first be confirmed by EUS or MRCP . Any patient with obstructive jaundice, irrespective of the cause, is at risk of increased bleeding owing to malabsorption of vitamin K (bile-acid-dependent), which is required by the liver to synthesize clotting factors II, VII, IX and X . Patients with acute cholangitis exhibiting signs of Charcot's triad usually respond to intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but need subsequent clearance of CBD obstruction . If ERCP clears all stones from the CBD, the patient can then undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Some patients may require more than one attempt by ERCP to clear all stones from the CBD . A plastic stent is sometimes placed in the bile duct during ERCP to achieve biliary drainage if it is not possible to remove all the stones and further attempts should be planned . Clearance of all stones from the CBD through ERCP is possible in more than 95% of patients . ERCP with sphincterotomy is also useful for patients who have recently undergone a cholecystectomy and present with retained CBD stones . Complications of ERCP include pancreatitis, perforation, bleeding and cholangitis in about 5% of patients . Cholecystectomy is recommended after ERCP with sphincterotomy and bile duct stone clearance, in order to prevent recurrence of biliary symptoms and biliary colic . Surgical exploration of the CBD may be needed for patients with stones that could not be cleared by ERCP . more clear-cut guidelines on use of various imaging modalities for detection of bile duct stones .","Around 10-20% of patients with stones in the gallbladder have common bile duct (CBD) stones at the time of cholecystectomy (the prevalence rises with age). Transabdominal ultrasound is 25-80% accurate for detection of CBD stones, depending on the experience of the examiner. Endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are accurate tests for detection of CBD stones and should generally precede endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), unless the clinical signs and symptoms and transabdominal ultrasound findings make therapeutic ERCP inevitable. Clearance of all stones from the CBD via ERCP is possible in more than 95% of patients. Biliary decompression, preferably by endoscopic or radiologic means, is critical in severe suppurative cholangitis with choledocholithiasis."
9781912776153,chp2,"Patients with cardiac arrhythmias can present with symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, syncope or presyncope, as well as chest pain . Patients may have no cardiac symptoms at all (exempli gratia with atrial fibrillation [AF] after a stroke, or as a finding at screening) . Alternatively, patients may present with sudden cardiac death as their first symptom, usually as a result of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, and they may be resuscitated from a cardiac arrest, often out of hospital . Patients with chest pain, rhythm disturbance or murmurs need further investigation . Palpitations are common in patients with any cardiac arrhythmia . When interviewing a patient with palpitations, it is important to determine whether the palpitations represent abnormal awareness of a normal heart beat or an actual cardiac rhythm disturbance (id est normal awareness of an abnormal beat) . The occurrence of other symptoms depends on factors such as the patient's premorbid fitness level and the presence or absence of underlying cardiac disease . For example, a 20-year-old with atrial arrhythmia or supraventricular tachycardia may not have many symptoms other than palpitations, whereas a 60-year-old with mitral stenosis or regurgitation may have severe symptoms such as shortness of breath or even pulmonary edema . Sometimes patients will notice that their palpitations feel irregular, suggesting AF, but this is not a consistent or reliable observation and it can be difficult to determine whether or not the heart is regular at fast rates . The normal heart beat is not entirely regular; the sinus node is under autonomic control and is influenced by breathing and exercise . In the young, marked variation in the heart rate with breathing may occur; this is normal and is termed sinus arrhythmia (see page 12) . Symptoms are more common with ventricular ectopics, which are associated with a greater disturbance to hemodynamic function . Symptoms are related to uncoordinated ventricular contraction, causing abnormal movement of the heart within the chest, or due to retrograde atrial activation and contraction of the atria against closed atrioventricular valves . Atrial or ventricular ectopics arise after exercise (when the sinus node slows down rapidly but the catecholamines produced during exercise are still circulating and cause firing of cells), during rest, and often before going to sleep . If the patient has structural heart disease, the presence of ventricular ectopics may require further cardiological investigation . A slow regular heart rate at around 40 beats per minute could represent heightened vagal tone, often seen in athletic individuals, or in families, or could signify sinus node dysfunction or even complete heart block . In sinus rhythm with complete heart block, irregular cannon waves (large A waves that occur when the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve) may be visible on clinical examination . Cardiac syncope is usually characterized by sudden and complete loss of consciousness for less than 1-2 minutes . . Symptomatic patients are evaluated to determine any concerns regarding possible cardiac arrhythmias . Arrhythmias are usually treated because symptoms interfere with a patient's quality of life .","Patients with arrhythmias can present in a variety of ways. Occasionally, it may be important for the patient to distinguish increased awareness of heart beat from true cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with palpitations and known structural cardiac disease should be evaluated without delay."
9781908541994,ch07,"Physical treatments for acne and scarring . There is a risk of increasing the inflammation associated with acne if the contents of the comedone are extruded into the dermis, rather than onto the surface of the skin . Macrocomedones are large comedones that are often resistant to treatment with topical retinoids and oral isotretinoin . Use of light electrocautery 60-90 minutes after the application of the topical anesthetic EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) on these lesions has been reported to accelerate their resolution . However, the effects are short-lived, and clearly the potential risk of skin malignancies negates the possible short-term improvement that ultraviolet (UV) light might induce in acne . Visible light treatment has the advantage of avoiding the potential risks of UV radiation . A recent review has assessed the effects and safety of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of acne: 492 patients from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated . Many combinations of light sources and photosensitizers have produced positive results in patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions; in some cases, these treatments have also reduced sebum production . However, the evidence for PDT as a good treatment option for acne, producing positive results with acceptable side effects, is limited . More RCTs are needed to determine the best types and concentrations of photosensitizers and light sources, and the duration of light activation and incubation in order to obtain the best results . This mode of therapy is a useful adjuvant to treatment with oral antibiotics or isotretinoin . It is particularly helpful in patients who develop these lesions only rarely and who are not candidates for treatment with isotretinoin . Patients with a family history of scarring acne may be at increased risk of developing acne scars . Hypertrophic and keloidal scars occur most often on the chest and back of young patients with severe cystic acne . Referral to a dermatologist should be considered for a consultation regarding the possible use of intralesional injection with triamcinolone, treatment with silicone gel sheeting or laser therapy . Acne scars that are erythematous may respond to treatment with a pulsed-dye laser, which reduces the erythema of the scar . The treatment of atrophic acne scars is based on type, distribution and depth . Appropriate techniques include fillers, subcision, punch elevation, punch grafting, surgery and chemical reconstruction of skin scars (CROSS), a method that uses a high concentration of trichloroacetic acid localized on the depth of a single scar . It has been shown to add volume to the skin and lift and smooth pitted acne scars to the level of the surrounding areas . Superficial and widely distributed scars may benefit from laser therapy, peelings, dermarolling and dermabrasion . Punch grafting is a useful technique wherein the scar is removed with a punch excision . CO laser abrasion and peelings should be used only after the patient's acne is no longer active . Studies investigating the use of these methods during or immediately after oral isotretinoin have produced conflicting results; some trials have demonstrated impaired healing while others have shown it to be safe .","Macrocomedones frequently require surgical treatment with cautery, as pharmacological therapeutic options are unhelpful. Acne nodules/cysts respond well to intralesional triamcinolone injection or cryotherapy. Acne scarring is common, and the best approach is prevention by early effective therapy. Laser therapy may be helpful for acne scarring."
9781910797297,chp4,"Histologically, this group of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) is characterized by varying degrees of CD30 expression, a cytokine belonging to the tumor necrosis receptor family . However, up to 20% of patients with LyP may present with or subsequently develop other lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides (MF), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL), Hodgkin lymphoma or other hematologic malignancies; further laboratory work-up and imaging is needed if systemic signs and symptoms are present or develop . As suggested by the 'MF-like' pattern, LyP type B biopsies show either a wedge-shaped or lichenoid infiltrate of CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD30-, small- to medium-sized cerebriform lymphocytes . Type D (cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma-like) is characterized by CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD30+ markedly epidermotropic cerebriform T cells with a lichenoid or wedge-shaped dermal infiltrate (Figure 4.4) . This histological pattern can be seen in both pagetoid reticulosis and cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma . CD45RO can also be a helpful marker, as this is generally negative in cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma . Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is recognized as a separate entity to nodal ALCL, because of the good response PC-ALCL has to treatment and good prognosis . Unlike patients with LyP, patients with clinical and histological findings for PC-ALCL must undergo full systemic work-up consisting of CBC, LDH, metabolic panel, HIV test and full body CT or PET-CT . Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is another difficult disease entity to diagnose purely on histopathology, as there is significant histological overlap with lupus panniculitis and primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma (Table 4.3) . As discussed above, there is histological overlap between SPTCL and primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma (see Table 4.3) . The infiltrates are characterized by a dense, nodular to diffuse pattern of medium- to large-sized pleomorphic cells (Figure 4.13) . Immunophenotypically, the neoplastic cells are CD3+, CD4-, CD8-/+, CD56+, TCR-gamma+, betaF1- and EBER1- with a cytotoxic phenotype (positivity with TIA-1, granzyme-B and perforin) (Figure 4.14) . Because of the clinically aggressive nature of gamma/δ lymphoma and high association of systemic spread, complete diagnostic work-up must be performed, including a full physical examination, CBC, LDH, metabolic panel, flow cytometry, TCR PCR, HIV test, human T-cell lymphocytic virus (HTLV-1) test, full body CT or PET-CT, and lymph node and bone marrow biopsy . The previously recognized entity of generalized pagetoid reticulosis (also known as Ketron-Goodman disease) is now better categorized as primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma . Helpful features to distinguish primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma include lack of interface dermatitis, minimal subcutaneous involvement and an alpha/beta rather than gamma/δ phenotype . Moreover, as with all cytotoxic lymphomas, the required work-up includes full physical examination, CBC, LDH, metabolic panel, flow cytometry, TCR PCR, HIV test, HTLV-1 test, full body CT or PET-CT and, if warranted, a lymph node and/or bone marrow biopsy . Histology shows a dense, diffuse, dermal to subcutaneous infiltrate of large, pleomorphic neoplastic cells . Histopathology shows a dense, diffuse, dermal and subcutaneous infiltration of medium- to large-sized neoplastic cells with plasmacytoid and blastoid morphology (Figure 4.20) .","Multiple histological variants of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) exist, although there is no prognostic significance between the subtypes. However, some of the subtypes histologically overlap with other forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and clinical correlation is needed to distinguish these. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) is composed of sheets of CD30+ activated T cells that comprise more than 75% of the neoplastic cells. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-1, epithelial membrane antigen and full staging work-up are used to distinguish between a primary cutaneous tumor and cutaneous involvement from nodal ALCL. Primary cutaneous small/medium CD4+ T cell lymphoproliferative disorder is an indolent process comprised of diffuse to nodular collections of CD4+ cells that generally present as single papules on the head and neck. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a subcutaneous indolent disorder composed of CD3+, CD8+, betaF-1+ T cells with notable rimming of adipocytes, in contrast to gamma/δ lymphoma which is clinically aggressive and comprised of dermal and subcutaneous CD4-/CD8- or rarely CD4+, CD8+ T cells with a gamma/δ (TCR-gamma+) phenotype. The clinically aggressive cytotoxic CTCLs are: primary cutaneous gamma/δ lymphoma, primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma (Berti's lymphoma) and extranodal NK-T cell lymphoma, nasal type. These diseases have a CD8+ or CD56+ immunophenotype and display T-cell intracellular antigen-1+, granzyme-B+ and perforin+ cytotoxic markers. Full systemic work-up is necessary. Other rare secondary cutaneous T-cell processes occur from systemic T-cell lymphomas, and correlation with nodal histopathology is helpful in diagnosis."
9781910797082,ch06,"Phototherapy involves whole-body exposure to artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and is being widely and increasingly used for the treatment of extensive psoriasis resistant to topical therapy . Systemic retinoids, such as acitretin, are widely used with PUVA and may be combined with UVB phototherapy to reduce total UVB exposure . The advantage of this unit is its ability to deliver a specific wavelength of light (id est 308 nm) directly to lesions of psoriasis only, thus sparing the unaffected skin and reducing total body UVB irradiation . Narrow-band UVB may be less likely to produce burning than broad-band UVB, though both are probably associated with a long-term risk of skin cancer . As with any form of chronic UV exposure, it is likely that phototherapy carries an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, which increases with cumulative exposure . Broad-band UVB is probably associated with a small increase in the risk of squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in patients receiving high-level exposure (more than 300 treatments) . Narrow-band UVB phototherapy has now been in clinical use for long enough to determine the associated risk precisely . Although phototherapy is a popular and effective treatment for psoriasis, a significant number of patients find the repeated journeys to the hospital and/or clinic for multiple treatment sessions inconvenient and also expensive . To achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy and minimize the attendant risks of overexposure, home use of narrow-band UVB, which has replaced broad-band UVB, requires significant training of the patient and close supervision from a hospital/clinic base . Thus, with the quality and safety of newer home narrow-band UVB machines and the ability of the prescribing dermatologist to electronically monitor the total number of treatments used by patients at home, the use of these machines for the appropriate patient should be encouraged . Current recommendations for all patients receiving oral PUVA therapy include wearing photoprotective UVA-screening glasses for 24 hours following treatment . Premature aging of the skin, together with thinning and bruising, occurs in patients with light skin (types I or II) who have received high-dose PUVA (multiple courses over years of therapy) . Patients who have received large cumulative doses of PUVA (in excess of 2000 J/cm or more than 260 treatments) are at greater risk of squamous cell carcinoma, particularly if they are fair-skinned . To reduce the overall risk of skin cancer, PUVA is often combined with systemic retinoids or topical therapy, such as vitamin D and vitamin A derivatives, so that fewer treatments are needed and the cumulative UVA dose is reduced . As with phototherapy, PUVA is relatively contraindicated in patients who already have risk factors for skin cancer . The use of a photosensitizing drug, methoxsalen, in combination with long-wave UVA was first reported in 1974 and has become routine therapy for the management of moderate-to-severe psoriasis . It is essential that the dosage of UVA and, if necessary, oral methoxsalen, is adjusted depending on the individual patient's sensitivity and skin type . Remission rates with PUVA are superior to almost all other forms of therapy, including systemic treatments .","Phototherapy (broad-band UVB and narrow-band UVB) is widely used for extensive chronic plaque psoriasis and sebo-psoriasis, and persistent guttate psoriasis. Burning and, rarely, photosensitive rashes complicate phototherapy in the short term. There is a small increase in the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer with long-term phototherapy. Photochemotherapy (PUVA) is indicated for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis involving more than 10% of the body surface area, and those whose psoriasis does not respond to topical therapy. Short-term risks of PUVA include nausea (following oral ingestion of methoxsalen), itching and phototoxic reactions. Long-term risks of PUVA include premature skin aging and skin cancer (non-melanoma and melanoma). In patients who already have risk factors for skin cancer, phototherapy and PUVA should be prescribed only with extreme caution."
9781908541680,ch_4,"Overweight/obesity as a whole predisposes to, or is associated with, numerous cardiac complications such as coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial fibrillation, heart failure and sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in blood glucose, lipids, blood pressure, coagulation and inflammation . Independent of any of the other known cardiometabolic risk factors, obesity is associated with hypertension, tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy, increased collagen deposition, reduced cardiac contractility and increased end-diastolic pressure . 'Metabolic syndrome' describes the clustering in an individual of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, namely abdominal obesity (Figure 3.1), abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia and hypertension . In addition, many other conditions with shared etiology, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; see Polycystic ovary syndrome) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; see Liver and gastrointestinal disorders), which are characterized by insulin resistance and excess and/or ectopic fat, are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk even though the criteria for the metabolic syndrome may not be met . Only the insulin receptors in liver, muscle and adipose tissue are abnormal in patients with insulin resistance; the other organs of the body have normal sensitivity but become overstimulated because of the high circulating levels of insulin, leading to further complications of metabolic syndrome . The only logical way to treat one or more of the elements of metabolic syndrome in obese patients is to tackle the insulin resistance, either by weight loss or with specific pharmacotherapy . Other factors predisposing to type 2 diabetes mellitus include smoking; lack of physical activity; high intake of sugared soft drinks, refined carbohydrate and saturated fat; and low intake of fiber . Individuals of South Asian origin are more at risk from the comorbidities of obesity (including type 2 diabetes mellitus) at a lower body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference than their Caucasian counterparts . Management of obese patients at risk of or with type 2 diabetes mellitus . Orlistat reduces fat mass and has effects on glucose regulation that are beneficial in the management of diabetes in obese patients . The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated metformin to be an effective monotherapy for the treatment of obese patients with diabetes by improving insulin resistance and accordingly reducing plasma insulin and triglyceride levels without risk of hypoglycemia . The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (see Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) is the optimal procedure for severely obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus because it results in up to 40-50% excess weight loss, the effects are durable in the long term and remission of diabetes occurs in up to 80% of patients, particularly if surgery is performed early in the course of the disease . The risk of hypertension is increased fivefold among obese people compared with their lean counterparts, and in up to two-thirds blood pressure is raised as a direct consequence of excess weight . Weight loss through dietary modification and increased physical activity is the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of both obesity and hypertension, whether they occur alone or together .","Obesity significantly affects cardiometabolic status and risk. The metabolic syndrome defines the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors under the umbrella of obesity. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the comorbidity most closely linked with obesity. Weight loss prevents the disease in those at risk and improves glycemic control when it is present. Lipid disorders and hypertension are exacerbated by obesity and add to cardiovascular risk. Weight loss rapidly and effectively reduces cardiovascular risk and the burden of atrial fibrillation, and improves cardiac function."
9781910797495,chp7,"Spinal cord injury (SCI; trauma or disease) (Figure 7.1) and stroke are the most common causes of lesions in the spinal cord or brain and brainstem that cause central pain, but there are many others (Table 7.1) . have provided evidence of a key role of ventromedial posterior thalamic lesions that allow disinhibition of a medial spinothalamic tract projecting via the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus to the anterior cingulate cortex (limbic system) - this appears to be associated with the burning nature of central post-stroke pain and also generates cold hypesthesia . reported that lesions limited to the ventral caudal thalamic nucleus may produce a similar presentation of central post-stroke pain . Thus, there are several sites of lesion associated with post-stroke pain; unfortunately, this does not yet provide insight into the precise mechanisms of such pain . The study of central pain arising from SCI has been more productive than that of post-stroke pain . which reported that at-level SCI pain often progressed to below-level pain - suggesting spinal and supraspinal mechanisms triggered by at-level SCI pain predispose to below-level 'central' pain . Brain-imaging studies have reported neuroplastic changes in the brain that correlate with the severity of post-SCI pain (see Figure 1.10) . It has long been known that complete SCI lesions remove descending inhibitory control and allow severe autonomic mass reflexes . Stroke is the most common cause of neuropathic pain related to brain lesions . It is important to differentiate non-neuropathic pain, which is present in 60% of SCI patients at 5 years, and includes mechanical spinal instability, painful muscle spasms and secondary overuse syndromes (exempli gratia of the shoulder joint in paraplegics) . In one study of SCI from trauma, 12% of patients had below-level neuropathic pain by 2 weeks after injury, and this had risen to 20% by 6 months . Sometimes all of the area below the level of the spinal lesion is painful, but in some patients the area may be smaller or even very localized (exempli gratia bladder or rectum) . Physical therapy has a wide range of roles in patients with post-stroke and SCI pain because of complications related to immobility, postural changes and/or overuse syndromes, or to help relieve symptoms related to neurological disease, such as multiple sclerosis . A reduction in central post-stroke pain has been reported for amitriptyline, with the number needed to treat (NNT) being 1.7 (range 1-3) and pain-relieving effects noted from the second week of treatment onwards . In contrast, there is no evidence for the efficacy of amitriptyline at doses of 50-125 mg in post-SCI central pain . Some studies of intravenous lidocaine infusion report short-term efficacy for SCI pain or post-stroke pain . One study of the cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) at a dose of 10 mg reported efficacy in patients with multiple sclerosis . Strictly speaking this is a 'peripheral lesion'; however, often there is extensive damage to the spinal cord and the pain is similar to central pain . In SCI pain, one controlled study reported efficacy of morphine plus clonidine given intrathecally, but not for either drug alone .","Central pain results from lesions in the brain and brainstem or spinal cord. The most common causes are stroke and traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), though there are many other causes. More than 8% of patients who have had a stroke develop central pain. This is probably an underestimate because communication problems may impede diagnosis of pain. Onset of post-stroke pain may occur up to several years after the injury. Within 2 weeks of SCI, 12% of patients have below-level neuropathic pain which is 'central'; by 6 months, 20% have central pain. Mean onset time is 1.8 +- 1.7 years (wide variation). The pathophysiology of central post-stroke pain (CPSP) involves a key role for lesions in diverse areas of the brain, including several different thalamic nuclei. One such lesion results in disinhibition of a nociceptive pathway that projects to the anterior cingulate cortex (limbic system) - this pathophysiology is associated with the burning quality of CPSP. The pathophysiology of SCI pain involves a 'spinal generator' and a 'supraspinal generator/amplifier'. Treatment of central pain is extremely challenging and requires a multimodal approach based on a biopsychosocial model. Differential diagnosis of pain type is crucial. New innovative physical/psychological treatments show promise of addressing maladaptive brain neuroplasticity changes. Pharmacotherapy, based on only a small number of controlled studies, have demonstrated efficacy of amitriptyline for CPSP (although not yet studied, a trial of serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs] may be preferable because of their lower toxicity) and pregabalin in both SCI and CPSP. Short-term efficacy has been reported for systemic (intravenous infusion) lidocaine (lignocaine), propofol and ketamine, but there is no evidence of long-term efficacy. Dorsal root entry zone lesioning can provide long-term relief of central pain after brachial plexus avulsion."
9781905832729,ch_5,"Urodynamic studies are rarely indicated initially in patients who have symptoms suggestive of OAB, and most patients receive empirical treatment (drugs and or behavioral) whether or not urodynamic studies show detrusor overactivity . The only real role for these tests in patients with OAB symptoms is if conservative therapy fails and more invasive treatment is contemplated . It is important to note, however, that only approximately 50% of patients with symptoms of detrusor overactivity will have an abnormality on supine slow-filling cystometry . Behavioral therapy (sometimes referred to as 'conservative treatment') helps an individual change habits to modify bladder symptoms and learn training techniques to control symptoms of bladder dysfunction . They include lifestyle changes or so-called 'self-care practices' and bladder training, urgency suppression and pelvic floor muscle training exercises . There is a common misconception that a fluid intake of up to 3 liters/day is needed for good health, and this becomes apparent in the frequency/volume bladder records of many patients . However, many patients with OAB will report too severe a restriction of daily fluid intake which is also not a good practice . A trial of caffeine-intake reduction is indicated in all patients presenting with OAB symptoms . See Table 4.1 for specific foods and beverages that patients should consider reducing to determine the effect on OAB symptoms . There is evidence to suggest that weight loss, even a moderate amount of 5 to 10%, can help with the symptoms of OAB in overweight patients . A toileting program, such as bladder training, can help this frequency as it uses a progressive voiding schedule combined with techniques to control and suppress urgency . Bladder training has been shown to be beneficial, and a course lasting for a minimum of 6 weeks, together with pelvic floor muscle training with exercises (see exercises in Table 3.3), should be offered as first-line treatment . Individuals with OAB can use rapid repeated pelvic floor muscle contractions ('quick flicks') to suppress urgency and control incontinence and restore a normal voiding interval . Antimuscarinic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for symptoms of OAB and detrusor overactivity (Table 4.3) . These drugs were thought to act by blocking the muscarinic receptors on the detrusor muscle that are stimulated by acetylcholine released by activated parasympathetic nerves, thereby reducing the ability of the bladder to contract . It should be noted, however, that these drugs work mainly during the storage phase, decreasing urgency and increasing bladder capacity, when there is normally no parasympathetic input into the lower urinary tract . The effects of antimuscarinic drugs in patients with OAB symptoms are shown in Table 4.4 . Research has shown that combining drug therapy with behavioral treatment will produce the best outcome in terms of reduction in OAB symptoms . BTX has been shown to be effective in the treatment of detrusor overactivity within 1-2 weeks of administration . The bladder remains overactive, but when it contracts the improved compliance means that lower intravesical pressures are generated, protecting the upper tracts from the effects of high intravesical pressure .","Overactive bladder (OAB) describes a condition in which the patient experiences urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Detrusor overactivity refers to involuntary detrusor contractions during filling; diagnosis is by urodynamic investigation. Bladder overactivity can be neurogenic or idiopathic. Idiopathic OAB can be associated with bladder outlet obstruction. A frequency/volume bladder record is useful in diagnosis. Initial management includes behavioral modification. Antimuscarinic drugs are a mainstay of conservative treatment. Other options for refractory OAB are neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Intradetrusor botulinum toxin injection is under investigation and seems promising for refractory cases."
9781908541178,ch_8,"Epidural injections are mainly used to relieve refractory sciatic nerve root pain, dysesthesias and/or associated paresis . In the case of spinal stenosis with associated neurogenic claudication, an epidural injection every few months may permit more comfortable walking and standing, an improved quality of life, and postpone or possibly rule out surgical interventions . Nerve root canal injections are performed under fluoroscopic visualization to enhance precision and minimize the risk of inadvertent needle placement . They are indicated for refractory nerve root impingement syndromes where conservative measures have proved inadequate, and where clinical, radiographic and electrodiagnostic procedures can, with reasonable precision, identify the locus of the root canal neural compression . Nerve root canal injections performed under fluoroscopic guidance carry similar risks to those associated with epidural injections . There is no guarantee that symptoms will be relieved by a nerve root canal injection, or that, even if properly performed, the intervention will relieve pain or restore useful function to weakened muscles . In an early study, injections of 3 mL of 5% hypertonic saline into facet joints provoked immediate local deep, dull pain in both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic controls . Subsequent studies, however, have not produced consistent results with regard to relief of symptoms, arthrographic findings or responses to intra-articular anesthetic injections . For those few who do not improve, sacroiliac corticosteroid joint injections can be performed under fluoroscopic guidance in a manner similar to that used for facet joint injection . Those patients who showed a positive response in terms of pain reduction on moving the sacroiliac joint area then received injections of betamethasone and lidocaine . Although far from conclusive, this suggests that sacroiliac joint pain may be responsive to intra-articular corticosteroid injections . Regardless of the precise pathogenesis, local corticosteroid injections into tender bursae can often provide prompt pain relief . To delay urgently indicated surgery for loss of bowel and bladder control in acute cauda equina syndrome, or for major loss of muscular control that is not responsive to non-surgical measures including nerve root and/or epidural corticosteroid injections, risks potentially far greater damage . Expectations that a properly performed and appropriate operation will expedite the relief of pain and discomfort are usually realistic, but outcome perceptions depend on the type of questions asked, and at what point in the postoperative period they are asked . Percutaneous thermal intradiscal catheters have been tried in a small series of patients with low back pain who would otherwise have been treated with a lumbar fusion procedure . In addition to radiographic evidence of lumbar instability and low back pain, regardless of the cause, lumbar fusions are performed to permit spinal stabilization for extensive foraminotomies with facetectomies, neural decompressions and symptomatic pseudoarthrosis . Even in surgically successful lumbar fusions, only about one-third of patients with L4-S1 degenerative spondylosis and chronic low back pain unresponsive to previous non-surgical therapies obtain some measure of pain relief, because the association of the mechanical and degenerative abnormalities and the pain is often not clear .",Epidural and/or nerve root canal injections are safer and more reliable if done with fluoroscopic monitoring. Intrabursal and trigger-point injections with low-dose steroids can often provide prompt pain reduction. Surgery is usually effective for refractory sciatica but is of equivocal benefit for low back pain. Approximately one-third of successful spine fusions provide pain relief for chronic low back pain.
9781910797105,ch10,"The introduction and eventual widespread use of chlorpromazine and other antipsychotics facilitated a major paradigm shift in the treatment of people with schizophrenia, from a hospital-based to a community-based system of care . They have limited efficacy for negative symptoms or cognitive impairments in people with schizophrenia . In the treatment of acute psychotic episodes, these drugs usually begin to improve symptoms within the first week . The long-standing notion that antipsychotic drugs take 2-4 weeks to start working is false: at least half of the therapeutic effect on core psychotic symptoms occurs in the first 7 days . The second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) (Tables 10.2 and 10.3) were developed in an attempt to find effective antipsychotics with minimal potential for causing either EPS or TD . Clozapine is the only SGA that has been approved for the treatment of positive symptoms resistant to other antipsychotics (Case history 10.1) . Clozapine has not been shown to be effective for primary negative symptoms . Although clozapine causes few EPS and little TD, it does have a number of adverse effects that limit its use . However, the most clinically important adverse effects may be the substantial weight gain and disruptions of glucose and lipid metabolism that are associated with clozapine treatment . The substantially reduced risk of EPS at low to moderate doses has played a major role in their supplanting the FGAs as first-line treatments for acute psychotic episodes and maintenance therapy . However, none of the other SGAs has yet been shown to be as effective as clozapine for treatment-resistant positive symptoms . In particular, there were few differences in efficacy between the two classes of drugs; participants treated with FGAs showed a trend toward greater improvement in symptom and quality of life measures . In secondary versions of the CATIE study and CUtLASS, clozapine was found to be more effective than other SGAs for time to discontinuation, symptoms and self-reports of mental health . The CATIE study and CUtLASS demonstrate the clinical principle that selection of the most appropriate antipsychotic treatment requires an individualized evaluation of the benefits and risks of a particular agent . FGAs and SGAs are relatively effective for treating secondary negative symptoms, but leave untouched the primary avolitional syndrome described so eloquently by Kraepelin (see Chapter 1) . The limited efficacy of antipsychotics has led to the investigation of alternative treatments for negative symptoms . In pilot studies, these agents were shown to be effective in ameliorating persistent negative symptoms . Finally, there is emerging evidence that drugs that act at the alpha-7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor may have benefit for negative symptoms . FGAs have limited effects on the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia . However, although there are reports of small subgroups of patients who may benefit from combination therapy with one of these agents, there has not been a consistent demonstration of enhanced positive symptom efficacy when these drugs have been used in combination with antipsychotics . The most common practice is to add a second antipsychotic medication in patients with residual positive symptoms .",First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are effective treatments for the acute phase and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. The long-acting injectable (depot) forms of FGAs and SGAs are useful for patients who are non-adherent to their medications. Clozapine is the only SGA that is effective for positive symptoms resistant to other antipsychotics. SGAs other than clozapine have become the first-line treatments for acute psychotic episodes and maintenance therapy. FGAs and SGAs are relatively effective for treating secondary negative symptoms but are not effective in treating primary negative symptoms and have limited effects on the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia. Add-on treatments for people with residual positive symptoms have not been clearly demonstrated to be effective.
9781908541796,chapter10,"In addition, small molecule drugs targetting specific pathways that are deregulated in certain lymphoma subtypes are being developed and are currently in clinical trials . There are a wide variety of chemotherapy drugs (exempli gratia fludarabine, vincristine and vinblastine) that target cells in the cell cycle, some of which work in a stage-specific manner . It has been appreciated for some time that using a combination of drugs that act at different points in the cell cycle (and some which are not stage specific) has a greater overall effect on the cancer cell . Most of these effects can be explained by the action of chemotherapy on the relatively few healthy cells that normally have an active cell cycle . Fractionation allows a degree of repair of normal tissues in between doses and results in increased oxygenation of the tumor, which makes it more radiosensitive and maximizes the likelihood of treatment occurring at a favorable time in the cell cycle at some point during the regimen . When rituximab was first introduced, there was concern that the resulting depletion of normal B cells would lead to an increase in the rate of serious infection, but this has not yet been observed in extensive clinical trials . Other monoclonal antibodies in clinical use, such as alemtuzumab (which targets CD52 and depletes both B cells and T cells), cause more profound immunosuppression resulting in an increased rate of infection . In general, the higher the dose of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, the greater the number of lymphoma cells that is destroyed . To reduce the duration of marrow failure with high doses of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, stem cells can be infused into the bloodstream 1 or 2 days after the completion of treatment . The patient's own stem cells can be collected before the high-dose therapy . For an autologous transplant, the patient is normally given a cycle of chemotherapy 10-12 days before the harvest . Autologous stem-cell transplantation is most frequently used in the treatment of lymphoma . For the transplant procedure (Figure 10.6), patients first receive high-dose chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy . This is followed 1 or 2 days after the last dose of treatment by infusion of the stem cells in a process similar to a blood transfusion . About 2-4 days after the stem cell infusion, the patient's blood counts drop and an infection often develops . The side effects of autologous transplantation are generally due to the chemotherapy . Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, like autologous transplantation, uses chemotherapy or radiotherapy to kill the lymphoma cells . However, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation also uses the graft-versus-lymphoma effect to attack any residual cells . Previously, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation always used very high doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before infusing the stem cells . The risk of infection persists after the blood counts have recovered, partly because the donor immune cells do not initially appear to work as efficiently and partly because most patients receive powerful immunosuppressant drugs for at least the first few months after the transplant .","The treatment of lymphoma often involves multiple modalities: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and/or high-dose therapy with stem-cell support. Chemotherapy is administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously or intrathecally. Some side effects are common to all chemotherapy agents, such as fatigue, nausea and bone-marrow suppression, but some are agent specific. For complex chemotherapy regimens, indwelling venous catheters are often used but they carry the risks of infection and thrombosis. Radiotherapy kills cells by causing damage to the DNA. Side effects of radiotherapy include damage to local tissues in the radiation field and an increased risk of secondary cancers. These effects are minimized by using fractions (which also increases efficacy) and by careful planning. Monoclonal antibody therapy with rituximab (anti-CD20) has revolutionized the treatment of both high- and low-grade lymphomas, and indications for this agent are likely to expand. High-dose therapy with autologous stem-cell support is useful for patients with certain types of relapsed lymphoma and may be indicated as part of first-line therapy for very aggressive lymphomas. High-dose therapy with allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is a toxic procedure, but it may result in cure, particularly in cases of low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A number of small-molecule pathway inhibitors are currently in development, several of which show very encouraging activity."
9781912776238,ch1,"Biological medicines (biologics) are drugs derived or extracted from living systems, usually modified bacteria, fungi or animal cells; the three main categories are listed in Table 1.1 . Biologics are inherently more expensive than past-generation medicines; they represent the result of costly investment in research and development and are manufactured using cellular-based technologies and utilizing gene expression . For example, 8 weeks of standard chemotherapy for advanced colorectal cancer cost US$63 in the small molecule era but $30 790 using biologics, representing an almost 500-fold increase in drug costs - although this has been accompanied by improved outcomes . Although chemical and biological drugs are both pharmaceutical products, they are very different when comparing their manufacturing, chemical structure and modes of action (Table 1.3) . This means that while the generic and biosimilar competitors fulfill similar economic roles, they pose very different pharmacological problems to developers and medicines regulators . A controlled manufacturing process is intrinsically important to biological medicines . To develop a biologic, a manufacturer creates their own unique cell line through genetic engineering to preferentially express the recombinant gene for the protein product . Importantly, minor variations could produce vastly different products as the process is extremely sensitive to changes in both manufacturing and production . The result is that, unlike conventional small molecule drugs, identical copies of biologics cannot be created - by definition, copies can only ever be 'similar' . To understand biosimilars you first need to understand biologics - for they have properties that are very different to the synthetic chemical drugs that preceded them . This variability has two main sources: inherent microheterogeneity and manufacturing process change . For this reason, most biological drugs undergo regular manufacturing process changes over the lifetime of a drug and so the product may not always remain identical over time . The manufacturing process can affect important aspects of the structure of a biological drug; a copied biologic can never therefore be entirely identical to the original reference product . Thus, the active substance of a biosimilar and its reference medicine is almost the same biological substance, but there may be minor differences as a result of their complex nature and production methods . In addition, manufacturing processes change frequently over the life of a biologic, adding to the potential for variability . A 2016 study of all European-approved originator monoclonal antibodies identified a mean of 11 changes with moderate or high potential risk of altering critical quality attributes (CQAs) per drug . Process change can result from advances in technology, such as higher yielding host cell systems, improvements in bioreactor design, scaling up of production to meet demand or if production is moved to a new manufacturing site . Changes in manufacturing risks the introduction of more significant variation in the tertiary structure of a biologic, known as 'step changes' (see Figure 1.3) . One example is the step change that resulted from a new process in the manufacture of darbepoetin alfa - this required confirmation through additional Phase I, II and III studies .","Biologics are typically proteins, ranging in size from simple proteins to large complex monoclonal antibodies. They are produced using living cell lines. All biologics have inherent variability, which creates batch-to-batch variability for all products. Furthermore, biologics themselves show inherent variation between batches (microheterogeneity), such that no batch is identical to previous batches. Biosimilars are highly similar, but not identical, to their reference (originator) biologic. The slight differences between batches of biologics, or between biologics and biosimilars, are evaluated and not expected to have any meaningful effect in clinical use. Changes to manufacturing processes can introduce significant changes to the structure of a biologic; analytics tests (and, exceptionally, new clinical trials) are required to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed for these therapies."
9781910797495,chp11,"It is now clear that visceral pain results from the activation of sensory afferent nerves that innervate internal organs such as the stomach, kidney, gallbladder, urinary bladder, intestines or pancreas . There are a variety of pain syndromes thought to be maintained by the persistent activation of visceral nociceptive fibers . Nociceptive input from the body surface travels along somatic nerves that enter spinal roots, accounting for the clear dermatomal organization of somatic pain sensations . High-threshold receptors exclusively innervate organs from which pain is the only conscious sensation (exempli gratia ureter, kidney, lungs, heart), but there are relatively few of this receptor type in organs that provide both innocuous and noxious sensations (exempli gratia colon, stomach, bladder) . However, it is clear that visceral pain is not always linked to injury or active disease . It is believed that persistent activation of visceral fibers leads to central sensitization and to visceral hyperalgesia and that, just as for hyperalgesia from chronic somatic pain, excessive activity of N -methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptors is involved in this process . Autoimmune responses and inflammation could trigger the persistent activation of visceral afferent fibers . The possibility that visceral nerve injury may give rise to persistent visceral neuropathic pain is embodied in the term 'complex regional pain syndrome' (see Chapter 5) . Treatment of visceral chronic pain syndromes is aimed at symptomatic pain management . As stress can activate or worsen visceral pain syndromes, stress reduction techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and integrative therapies can be helpful adjuncts . Most people can control their symptoms with diet, stress management and medications, but for some it can be disabling, preventing them from working, attending social events or traveling even short distances . Mild symptoms of IBS usually respond to stress management and changes in diet and lifestyle . Interstitial cystitis is a heterogeneous chronic pain syndrome that most commonly affects women (90%) . Symptoms include pain on bladder filling, pelvic pain and urinary urgency and frequency . In the absence of practical clinical criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis, the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health developed criteria for research purposes . To be diagnosed with interstitial cystitis for research purposes, patients must have glomerulations or Hunner's ulcer on cystoscopic examination, and either bladder pain or urinary urgency in the absence of other diseases that could cause the symptoms . Tanezumab, a monoclonal antibody with an affinity for nerve growth factor (NGF), which prevents toxins interacting with nociceptive neurons in the bladder, has shown promise in reducing pain and urgency in women with interstitial cystitis, but not in men with pelvic pain . Male chronic pelvic pain syndrome . Male chronic pelvic pain syndrome . The diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain syndrome is made in men who complain of chronic pelvic pain but who have an unrevealing examination and work-up . Interstitial cystitis (see above) and male chronic pelvic pain syndrome may be the same syndrome .","Visceral pain results from activation of sensory afferent nerves that innervate the stomach, kidney, gallbladder, urinary bladder, intestines, pancreas and other visceral organs. Sensations arising from visceral stimulation are generally more diffuse, more difficult to localize and more unpleasant than those associated with somatic pain. Visceral pain is more likely than somatic pain to be associated with autonomic signs such as pallor and sweating, or symptoms such as nausea. Pain syndromes such as male chronic pelvic pain syndrome, interstitial cystitis, endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome are thought to be maintained by the persistent activation of visceral fibers, and central sensitization. Management includes identifying and avoiding factors that aggravate the underlying condition and individual clinical trials of medication. Neuromodulatory techniques have been reported as helpful in selected cases."
9781908541024,ch_4,"The surgeon's role has always been central in the management of patients with brain tumors, and recent studies have demonstrated a favorable association between cytoreductive surgery and prognosis for a variety of brain neoplasms, including brain metastases and low- and high-grade gliomas . Situations associated with increased risk include stereotactic biopsy of highly vascular malignant lesions such as glioblastoma, and eloquent areas of the cerebrum where hemorrhage is more likely to be associated with neurological deficits . Modern conventional external-beam megavoltage radiotherapy administers irradiation in fractionated doses, thereby allowing normal tissues adequate time to recover from radiation damage . It can be curative for some types of brain tumor, such as germinoma, and has a central role in the management of most primary brain tumors, including low-grade and malignant gliomas, where it can reduce the rate of tumor progression and prolong patient survival . The toxic effects of radiotherapy on surrounding normal neurovascular structures limits the total dose of radiotherapy that can safely be administered to the target tumor . Attempts to improve tumor cell kill rates while preserving normal tissues have included further manipulation of the dose and schedule of radiotherapy . Radiation is usually administered as photons from an external cobalt source or high-energy linear accelerator, but electrons, protons and charged heavy particles have also been used for the treatment of brain tumors . Usually, however, it resembles curative radiotherapy schedules, extending over 25-30 treatments in an attempt to achieve protracted tumor control in patients such as those with low-grade gliomas or meningiomas, where a life expectancy of years is anticipated . External-beam radiotherapy is the most common technique for administering irradiation to brain tumors . Although the precise risk remains undefined, patients receiving brain radiotherapy are at increased risk for the development of meningiomas and gliomas in the treatment field (Figure 3.8) . Advances will probably be in the realm of novel techniques for delivering increased doses of radiotherapy to the tumor, while limiting toxicity to surrounding normal structures . For example, chemotherapy has recently been established as an essential component of the initial management of patients with glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults . These issues include the cellular kinetics of brain tumors, inherent or acquired drug resistance, the blood-brain barrier and the potential toxicity of chemotherapy . This enzyme is present in normal cells and brain tumors, and may explain the development of resistance to alkylating agents that is commonly observed in patients with brain tumors . The use of chemotherapy in patients with brain tumors is limited by the side effects of these compounds . Agents that are commonly administered by mouth for brain tumors include the alkylating drugs temozolomide and lomustine (CCNU) . These analogs have demonstrated single-agent activity against a spectrum of primary brain tumors, including malignant gliomas, medulloblastomas and PNETs, ependymomas and germ cell tumors . Although there have been remarkable gains in outcome for patients with malignant gliomas with, in particular, the use of temozolomide, better anticancer drugs are needed to advance the management of primary brain tumors .","MRI can suggest a diagnosis of a brain tumor, but surgery is always necessary to provide tissue for pathological diagnosis (except in the case of diffuse pontine glioma). Stereotactic biopsy is a safe procedure for obtaining diagnostic tissue, but sampling error may result in the tumor grade being underestimated. Image-guided surgery facilitates radical resection of intracranial tumors. Elderly patients with poor neurological function are at highest risk of morbidity and mortality following craniotomy for tumor resection. Following surgery, radiotherapy is the most effective treatment for long-term control of most intracranial neoplasms. Radiotherapy is associated with considerable brain side effects, including late toxicities such as dementia and cerebral radionecrosis. Conformal radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy are emerging techniques designed to provide maximal radiation dose to the tumor while sparing normal surrounding tissues. Inherent or acquired drug resistance and the blood-brain barrier are important factors limiting the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with brain tumors. The chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide has revolutionized the treatment of gliomas, and is now firmly established as a component of initial management for glioblastoma. Novel agents that target angiogenesis are the most promising of targeted therapies for malignant gliomas."
9781912776818,hh-4,"This can result in a first overt presentation of MAHA and thrombocytopenia in previously asymptomatic women with cTTP ('late-onset' cTTP), while women with a prior diagnosis of cTTP will usually experience an acute episode in pregnancy in the absence of prophylactic treatment . Presenting features are generally similar to those seen in non-pregnancy cases, though associated hypertension and proteinuria is often found, which can lead, erroneously, to a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia . Late-onset cTTP accounted for 66% (23/35) of UK cases of pregnancy-associated initial presentations of TTP and 24% (10/42) of French cases . Given the above, TTP (especially previously undiagnosed congenital disease) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained fetal growth restriction, unexplained second trimester pregnancy losses, unexplained thrombocytopenia in pregnancy (beyond the level expected for gestational thrombocytopenia, for example below 75 x 10 /L), 'atypical'/'severe' presentations of pre-eclampsia and in cases of HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count), with a low threshold for ADAMTS13 activity testing in all of these scenarios . The most common presentation of acute TTP is a previously healthy young to middle-aged adult with MAHA, severe thrombocytopenia and features of end-organ damage . Non-specific symptoms such as malaise, fatigue and weakness are common, and a non-specific prodrome may often precede the onset of the more specific features of hemolysis, thrombocytopenia or end-organ damage . However, there is a consensus that renal impairment, if present, is usually mild, and that acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy normally favors a diagnosis of atypical (or Shiga toxin-associated) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) over TTP . Onset of TTP in childhood or adolescence is also seen, though less commonly than in adulthood, accounting for approximately 10% of all first presentations of TTP . The clinical presentation mirrored that seen in adults, with MAHA and thrombocytopenia (usually severe) in all cases, fever in 36% and end-organ ischemic damage in 64% . In contrast to the typical onset in adulthood of iTTP, the rarer congenital form of TTP (accounting for about 5% of all cases of TTP), has classically been associated with an acute onset in the neonatal period or childhood . However, through the analysis of registry data,, , it is now well established that clinical presentation is diverse, with a substantial proportion of cTTP cases actually presenting in adulthood, especially in the context of pregnancy . While all cases have persistent severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, additional triggers such as infection or pregnancy are required to provoke acute symptoms of overt TTP . Of 73 UK TTP Registry cases of cTTP, 38% initially presented in childhood/adolescence, as did 58% of 43 Japanese cases . Meanwhile, 62% of cases of cTTP in the UK Registry were diagnosed in adulthood, with a median age at diagnosis of 31 years . In adulthood, cTTP usually presents with overt thrombotic microangiopathy, though the diagnosis is sometimes made as a result of investigations for thrombocytopenia . There may also be a history of stroke or pregnancy losses, or evidence of chronic end-organ damage including cardiac and renal dysfunction, especially if the diagnosis is made in late adulthood .","Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) usually presents acutely in previously healthy adults with diverse features resulting from microvascular thrombosis: (1) microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; (2) thrombocytopenia; and (3) end-organ damage. The brain, heart, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the most commonly affected end organs. Neurological symptoms are the most common. Congenital TTP is a much more common cause of TTP in childhood/adolescence and in pregnancy than in non-pregnant adults. Acute presentations of congenital TTP cannot generally be distinguished from immune-mediated TTP on the basis of presenting features, though some individuals have chronic subacute symptoms. Pregnancy is a trigger for TTP, especially the congenital form. This should be considered as a potential cause for unexplained fetal growth restriction or stillbirth, unexplained thrombocytopenia in pregnancy and atypical/severe cases of pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count)."
9781910797471,ch10,"Stem cell therapy remains a promising treatment for patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction caused by coronary ischemia/infarction . Intracoronary or intramyocardial injections of skeletal myoblasts or bone-marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMSCs) have led to a modest improvement in cardiac performance in some studies, including improvement in the LVEF and reduction in the size of scar tissue and cardiac volume . However, the clinical effect of such therapies has not yet been proven . The therapy appears to be well tolerated in patients after recent myocardial infarction (MI), but a proarrhythmic effect of cell therapy has been observed in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) . The recent CHART-1 trial was the largest multicenter and multinational study of stem cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF less than 35% and worsening HF (class III/IV within the preceding 12 months) . The primary efficacy endpoint was neutral but the exploratory analyses suggested a benefit (trends in reduction of clinical endpoints, and improvement in quality of life and physical fitness) in a large subset of the population defined by the degree of LV dilation and a lower number of injections . In addition, intracoronary administration of BMSCs seems to be associated with improvements in cardiac contractile and microvascular function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy . However, stem cell therapy is not yet ready to become a mainstay of clinical practice . Phrenic nerve stimulation in patients with central sleep apnea . This is an alternative approach to the treatment of patients with central sleep apnea (CSA), designed to restore a physiological breathing pattern throughout sleep . It uses a fully implantable system with transvenous leads designed for the long-term application of transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation (The Remedē System, Respicardia) . It works by stimulating the diaphragm during sleep to stabilize gas exchange and maintain normal breathing . Future large studies in patients with HF and CSA are awaited . Patiromer - a new treatment for chronic hyperkalemia . Hyperkalemia is common in patients receiving HF medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), spironolactone or eplerenone, and often limits their use . Management of hyperkalemia in these patients is often challenging and comprises dietary restriction and dose reduction or withdrawal of the offending agent . Short-term studies have confirmed its efficacy in maintaining normokalemia in patients treated with HF medications . Furosemide, the loop diuretic used to treat congestive HF, is licensed for use in oral and intravenous forms (see pages 96 -) . For patients with recurrent fluid overload, intravenous administration in a hospital setting is the only licensed choice, although in some countries off-label subcutaneous furosemide has been used for several years in the palliative care setting . A new formulation of subcutaneous furosemide that uses a dedicated sc2Wear™ infusor pump has been developed . Subcutaneous furosemide allows greater flexibility of administration, avoids the need for intravenous placement and potentially reduces the cost of care . Ongoing studies are awaited to establish its application and cost-effectiveness in patients with chronic HF .","Stem cell therapy has demonstrated a modest improvement in cardiac performance in some studies, but the clinical effect of such therapies has not yet been proven.

In short-term studies, patiromer, a non-absorbable compound that predominantly binds to potassium in the colon and exchanges it for calcium, has demonstrated efficacy in managing hyperkalemia in patients treated with HF medications. A new formulation of subcutaneous furosemide delivered via a dedicated device has been developed."
9781910797662,ch02,"Coexistent CIS and papillary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer confers a worse prognosis than papillary disease alone . This may explain why metastases with variant histology (exempli gratia as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) are seen in patients with pure UC primary tumors . Historically, squamous cell carcinoma accounted for up to 70% of bladder cancers in areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, such as Egypt (see page 12), whereas contemporary data suggest that UC is now the predominant histology in Egypt as the prevalence of schistosomiasis has decreased . Approximately 30-35% of adenocarcinomas are derived from the urachus and classically appear as a solid, invasive-appearing tumor in the dome of the bladder . Many patients with adenocarcinoma have poor prognosis because the tumor is already at an advanced stage at diagnosis . Urachal adenocarcinomas present as invasive tumors often visible on the dome of the bladder and tend to be asymptomatic until late in the disease course, since they arise in a minimally functional part of the bladder . Micropapillary cancer (Figure 2.2) is a particularly aggressive form of high-grade UC and is associated with a high risk of early muscle invasion and metastasis . Sarcomatoid bladder cancer is a rare variant, accounting for 0.3% of cases . The tumor-nodes-metastases (TNM) staging of the American Joint Committee on Cancer is the system most widely used for bladder cancer, illustrated in Figures 2.4 and 2.5 . The current grading system, introduced in 2004, stratifies bladder cancer into low and high grade, replacing the WHO 1973 three-grade system, as illustrated in Figure 2.6 . High-grade cancers have frequent cell cycle alterations, with mutations in p53 and RB1 and 9p and 9q loss of heterozygosity . Among patients who do experience recurrence, 20-30% of tumors (usually high grade) may progress to a higher stage . Thus, vigilant surveillance is necessary, as is judicious use of intravesical agents (see page 45) to decrease the likelihood of recurrence and progression in high-risk patients (exempli gratia those with large or multiple tumors, high-grade tumors, or Ta or T1 tumors with associated CIS) . CIS has a high rate of progression to muscle-invasive disease if it is not eradicated with intravesical therapy, usually bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) . On average, muscle-invasive disease is associated with regional lymph node metastases in 25% of patients . Mortality due to UC is directly related to the pathological stage and grade of bladder cancer (Table 2.2) . For those with low-grade Ta and T1 tumors, 5-year disease-specific survival should exceed 95%, whereas reported 5-year survival may be as low as 50% for patients with high-grade T1 cancers or CIS without adjuvant therapy . For patients with T2/T3aN0M0 disease, the 5-year survival rate is 60-70%, despite radical cystectomy . In patients who experience disease progression, this occurs within 2-3 years of cystectomy in about 80% of cases . Patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous carcinoma have a 5-year survival rate of more than 50% following radical cystectomy, provided that the lymph nodes are negative . Urachal adenocarcinoma is treated with partial cystectomy, and adjuvant therapy for locally advanced cancers is similar to the treatment for colon cancer .","Urothelial carcinoma is the predominant histology of bladder cancer. Variant histology is common and is usually seen as a mixed pattern with conventional urothelial cancer. Low-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors may recur but progression to muscle invasion occurs in < 5% of cases. High-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer will progress if not adequately treated with resection and intravesical therapy. Carcinoma in situ, whether primary or associated with Ta or T1 papillary tumor, is a high-risk cancer. Up to 30% of patients with high-grade non-muscle-invasive tumors and up to 70% with muscle-invasive disease may die of bladder cancer."
9781905832729,ch_3,"Urgency incontinence can take the form of frequent small losses between voids or large urine losses from sudden complete bladder emptying . With the exception of postmicturition dribble, all of the symptoms described below can be associated with bladder outlet obstruction, a poorly contracting detrusor or loss of coordination between detrusor contractility and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter, termed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) . Use of a bladder record or diary is a simple and practical method to obtain information on a patient's normal voiding pattern, including frequency and amount of micturition and episodes of leakage, in addition to the time and volume of fluid ingested . The frequency/volume bladder record is also useful for assessing and monitoring treatment, and to demonstrate the benefits of treatment to a patient . The presence of hematuria or red blood cells on microscopy should be investigated further with urine cytology, an imaging study of the upper tracts (kidneys and ureters) and endoscopic examination of the bladder and urethra to rule out malignancy, especially in a patient over 50 years of age with symptoms of bladder irritation . Many clinicians request urodynamic investigation for any patient, especially a woman, who complains of lower urinary tract symptoms; however, the clinician may have little appreciation of the clinical indications, what the test involves and its limitations . The UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued guidelines stating that preoperative urodynamic studies are not necessary for patients undergoing a primary procedure and whose symptoms and examination findings suggest simple stress incontinence . Furthermore, surgery for stress incontinence can lead to voiding dysfunction and de novo detrusor overactivity (the urodynamic term describing involuntary bladder contraction), or may exacerbate pre-existing symptoms, so it is important to perform a preoperative assessment . This assumes that other obvious causes for the symptoms (exempli gratia urinary infection) have been excluded and that neither hematuria (blood in the urine) nor significant bladder, urethral or pelvic pain is present . Thus, a patient with symptoms of detrusor overactivity may have a normal urodynamic study . Voiding symptoms and urinary retention are more common in men than women, reflecting a higher incidence of bladder outlet obstruction; however, voiding symptoms do occur in women, especially in association with POP or poor detrusor contractility . Patients with neurological disease and lower urinary tract symptoms are at risk of neurogenic detrusor overactivity, low compliance and DSD . Uroflowmetry is a simple test in which the patient voids in privacy into a commode that incorporates a urinary flowmeter that measures urine flow over time (Figure 2.4) . Urgency - this is a sudden compelling desire to void, described particularly by patients with detrusor overactivity or inflammatory bladder conditions . Detrusor function - abnormal detrusor contractions during bladder filling are noted; detrusor contractility during voiding can be assessed by recording the detrusor pressure in the voiding phase . When filling cystometry has been completed, the filling line is removed as described above, and the patient is asked to void with the bladder and abdominal pressure transducers still in place . If bladder filling symptoms are present, the volume of fluid infused should be noted .","Lower urinary tract symptoms are key in the diagnosis of bladder disorders: onset, duration and severity should be recorded. Urinary symptoms can relate to filling (frequency, nocturia, urgency), storage (stress incontinence, urgency incontinence, nocturnal enuresis) or voiding/emptying (hesitancy, intermittent stream, slow stream, terminal dribble, incomplete emptying). Physical examination is essential, and may include neurological examination, abdominal examination and examination of the genitals. Other assessments include cognitive and mobility evaluation, especially in the elderly. The effect of symptoms on quality of life can be assessed using self-completion questionnaires. A frequency/volume bladder record (bladder diary) is a simple and practical method to record voiding and fluid intake. Dipstick urinalysis is essential for all patients with urinary incontinence, bladder or urethral pain and is good practice in those with voiding/emptying symptoms. Positive tests should be evaluated further. Urodynamic investigation can provide a wide variety of information, but is not necessarily indicated for all patients."
9781908541024,ch_6,"This category of tumor accounts for 45-50% of all gliomas, arising most frequently in individuals aged 45-65 years . However, aggressive treatment that includes maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy has extended median survival to approximately 15-18 months . Several prognostic factors have been identified for glioblastomas, with more favorable outcomes being associated with younger age, greater preoperative and postoperative performance score, maximal surgical resection and the absence of necrosis . A recently completed randomized phase III study has demonstrated improved survival for patients receiving chemotherapy as part of their initial treatment . Despite this very important therapeutic advance, most individuals with glioblastomas will experience tumor recurrence within 2 years of the initial diagnosis . Aggressive treatment including maximal surgery and radiotherapy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy has resulted in reported median survival in excess of 5 years in some series . The use of adjuvant chemotherapy is more common in patients with anaplastic astrocytomas than in those with glioblastomas, but remains controversial . Low-grade astrocytomas account for 5-10% of all gliomas and typically arise in individuals aged 30-50 years . Patients who present with seizures only and have typical radiographic features of a low-grade astrocytic glioma are often observed for a period of time using serial imaging before any surgical intervention is undertaken . Chemotherapy has no established role in the initial management of low-grade astrocytomas, although trials in this area are under way . Consequently, both low-grade and anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors with co-deletion of 1p and 19q are being treated increasingly with chemotherapy first as a means of deferring cranial irradiation and its toxicities, although the best initial treatment strategy for these tumors remains unclear and is the focus of large phase III trials . Results of a recently completed phase III trial, in which patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendrogliomas were randomized to postoperative radiotherapy with or without PCV chemotherapy, failed to demonstrate a survival advantage of early versus delayed chemotherapy . Despite these disappointing results, chemotherapy is still routinely administered as part of initial therapy of anaplastic oligodendroglioma, although temozolomide has become the treatment of choice in most instances . Low-grade oligodendrogliomas are also sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents, although the role of chemotherapy in patients with this tumor type is less established . Complete surgical resection of pilocytic astrocytomas can be curative, and has been associated with 95% disease-free survival at 25 years for patients with cerebellar tumors . For patients with supratentorial pilocytic astrocytomas, 10-year survival rates of 80-100% have been reported following surgery . For malignant tumors, or recurrent ependymomas following surgical resection, radiotherapy is often indicated . The different types of gliomas share a number of characteristics, including indistinct margins that make complete surgical resection impossible, incurability, genetic instability and increasing malignancy over time, as well as a tendency for local recurrence following initial treatment . Astrocytic gliomas are the most common type, and include anaplastic astrocytomas and the highly malignant glioblastoma that can arise de novo or from a pre-existing low-grade astrocytoma .","The prognosis for patients with malignant gliomas is influenced most by histology, tumor grade and age. Increasingly, genetic aberrations are being identified at the molecular level in a variety of gliomas, and these abnormalities will assume substantial prognostic and therapeutic importance as greater knowledge of their significance is acquired. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive of all gliomas. Surgery is the principal initial treatment for gliomas. The benefit of extensive surgery versus limited resection or biopsy is controversial. Postoperative radiotherapy delays tumor progression and prolongs life for patients with malignant glioma. Concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy with radiotherapy for glioblastoma is now the standard treatment for most patients with glioblastoma following surgery. This treatment is associated with significant long-term survival in responding patients. Patients who have tumors with hypermethylated O-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase promotor regions appear to benefit most from this treatment strategy. The role of this regimen is unclear in elderly patients or patients with poor performance status with glioblastoma. The use of this regimen in anaplastic gliomas is being investigated. Chemotherapy is often administered for tumor recurrence or progression but is palliative and of limited benefit for most patients. More effective drugs are needed for this indication. Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a chemosensitive tumor. The appropriate timing of chemotherapy is controversial. Anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors that harbor co-deletion of 1p and 19q have a more favorable prognosis, and respond more consistently and durably to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Observation may be an appropriate initial strategy for patients with low-grade gliomas. The timing and extent of surgery for low-grade glioma is controversial. Increasingly, radiotherapy is deferred until clinically necessary, and lower doses are usually administered. The role of initial chemotherapy for low-grade gliomas is unclear, but is an option for a subset of patients with this diagnosis."
9781908541963,chapter10,"Although currently less common in the developed world, the incidence is expected to rise as patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C age . Thus, patients with advanced viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis or alcoholic liver disease are at risk . Hepatitis B presents a unique risk, as there is evidence that a tumor may develop in the absence of cirrhosis - presumably via direct integration of viral DNA into the host genome . The standard liver biochemical markers are not particularly helpful, although sudden elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase may suggest obstruction of the biliary tree by a tumor . In the absence of specific clinical findings, most hepatologists suspect HCC when there is a change in the expected clinical course of a patient with otherwise stable liver disease . Because of the non-specific clinical presentation, the diagnosis of HCC is typically made using serum tumor markers, imaging studies and, at times, liver biopsy . Immature (fetal) liver cells synthesize alpha fetoprotein (AFP) . Malignant hepatocytes resemble immature hepatocytes, and AFP is an important marker for HCC . A sudden rise in serum AFP or absolute levels greater than 500 ng/mL are highly suggestive of HCC . Lower levels can be seen with any liver disease that provokes hepatocyte regeneration (ongoing hepatitis, cirrhosis) . Imaging studies are particularly useful when confirming a diagnosis of HCC . It has better sensitivity than ultrasonography, making it particularly useful for detecting small tumors . Many hepatologists believe that suspected HCC lesions (suspected on the basis of imaging characteristics, growth patterns and elevated AFP levels) should not be biopsied for fear that the biopsy may spread the tumor . Nevertheless, because there are few symptoms or objective signs of the tumor before it progresses to an incurable stage, and because screening is associated with few risks, many practitioners offer screening to their patients . Patients with established cirrhosis, particularly from viral hepatitis or hemochromatosis, are at the highest risk for HCC . If tumors are small, there is no evidence of extrahepatic spread and the patient has preserved liver function, surgical resection may be considered . Unfortunately, however, few patients with HCC have resectable tumors or sufficient hepatic reserve to tolerate a partial hepatectomy, and approximately 50% of tumors will have recurred at 5 years . Liver transplantation may be an option for some patients, provided there is no evidence of extrahepatic spread and the patient is an otherwise good candidate for transplantation (see Chapter 12) . The prognosis is best for patients with either a single small tumor (less than 5 cm) or no more than three lesions, each smaller than 3 cm . Many patients with HCC are not candidates for liver transplantation or surgical resection . The medication, which is reserved for patients with well-preserved liver function, is generally well tolerated and has modest effects on survival . Other primary hepatic tumors . Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary hepatic malignancy in children . Hepatoblastoma is an aggressive tumor and is associated with a poor prognosis; its response to systemic chemotherapy or radiation is inconsistent .","Hepatocellular carcinoma is a worrisome complication of advanced liver disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma often has few specific symptoms or signs. Hepatocellular carcinoma should be suspected in patients with an unexpected worsening of liver disease. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is of unclear utility, but is widely practiced. Regular checking of serum alpha fetoprotein levels and hepatic ultrasound scanning are acceptable. Curative treatment by resection or transplantation is an option, but not always possible. Radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, transarterial chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are all treatment options."
9781908541406,ch_15,"A bleeding state may arise either because the patient develops a spontaneous pathological anticoagulant (often an antibody against one of the clotting factors) or, much more commonly, from therapy with an anticoagulant or antithrombotic drug . Bleeding is best managed with a bypassing agent such as recombinant human FVIIa or activated prothrombin complex concentrate; FVIII is only useful in patients with very low titer inhibitors, and must be monitored to ensure that effective levels of FVIII have been achieved . Rarely, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus develop antibodies directed against specific clotting factors, such as FVIII or prothrombin . Before starting any antithrombotic therapy it is essential to consider the balance between reducing the chances of thromboembolism and increasing the risk of bleeding in every patient . Furthermore, antithrombotic therapy should be reviewed regularly to ensure that the hemorrhagic potential of the patient has not changed (exempli gratia the development of renal or hepatic failure) and that the current dose of drugs is appropriate . General principles for the management of anticoagulant-associated bleeding are shown in Table 13.3, and specific agents used to control hemorrhage are highlighted in Table 13.4 . The regular use of ASA (aspirin) is associated with a twofold increase in the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding . Prior to prescribing antiplatelet agents, enquiry should be made about a family history of intracranial aneurysms or other potential risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the bleeding risks discussed with patients and their families . Bleeding due to ASA (aspirin) and NSAIDs is usually from the gastrointestinal tract and often responds to withdrawal of the drug and treatment with proton pump inhibitors . In patients treated with full-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin, the rate of major bleeding can be as high as 4.5%, depending on the dose and duration of treatment . The bleeding risk with fondaparinux, 2.5 mg/day, after surgery has been compared with LMWH (enoxaparin); the pooled estimates from four trials (3616 patients) were 2.7% and 1.7%, respectively . Bleeding associated with fondaparinux has been controlled with recombinant human FVIIa, 15-90 μg/kg, and this agent may be effective for bleeding due to the FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban . Other anticoagulants, such as the direct thrombin inhibitors hirudin or argatroban, are given intravenously, and after several days can usually be replaced by fondaparinux . Major bleeding may be controlled by a prothrombin complex concentrate, and activated charcoal can reduce drug absorption from the gastrointestinal tract . In most people, 3-5 days of exposure to warfarin are required before clotting factor levels decline to the extent that thrombosis is prevented or that bleeding is a risk . A prediction guide to assess the risk of warfarin-associated bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (ATRIA) weighs anemia and severe renal disease with 3 points each, age of 75 years and older with 2 points, and hypertension and past hemorrhage with 1 point each . If major bleeding occurs during the infusion of a thrombolytic agent, the drug should be stopped immediately and a full blood count and coagulation screen performed .","Pathological anticoagulants A pathological anticoagulant should be suspected when major unprovoked bleeding occurs in a previously well person. Pharmacological anticoagulants Serious bleeding associated with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents may be controlled by platelet transfusion and, if minor but troublesome, with desmopressin. A decline in hemoglobin in a patient receiving an anticoagulant should prompt an exhaustive search for a source of bleeding. Coumarins should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients with poor oral intake. The direct factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors currently available do not have specific antidotes and should be used cautiously in patients at risk for bleeding (those with renal failure, liver disease, previous stroke or history of hemorrhage). Thrombolytic agents Thrombolytic agents are associated with a risk of intracranial hemorrhage of nearly 1%; they should be administered in intensive care units and stopped immediately if signs of bleeding appear."
9781910797587,chp08,"This chapter provides an overview of the pharmacological therapies introduced in Chapter 6 (see Table 6.1) and their potential side effects . Furthermore, the management of any chronic musculoskeletal pain should include consideration of comorbid medical conditions and prompt evaluation, and occasionally pharmacological management, of associated sleep and mood disorders . Paracetamol can be used in combination with oral agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or in formulations with mild opioids . Despite its relative safety, recent data suggest that higher-dose paracetamol (more than 3 g/day) may still lead to upper gastrointestinal side effects, including bleeding, and may negatively affect renal function and blood pressure with daily use . Importantly, as well as being anti-inflammatory agents that work at peripheral sites (rather than in the CNS), NSAIDs are analgesics . NSAIDs may be more efficacious in certain individuals with OA, although clinical selection of these people on the basis of 'inflammatory' features (such as effusion) is not a good predictor of treatment response . Drugs with higher COX-2 selectivity (exempli gratia celecoxib, etoricoxib) were developed in an attempt to reduce the GI toxicity of NSAIDs . Studies have shown that the short-term efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in OA is similar to that of the traditional NSAIDs . Initial endoscopy studies and subsequent clinical trials have generally supported the concept that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with fewer upper GI problems, including ulceration and serious complications . Apart from GI toxicity, COX-2 inhibitors were initially found to have similar side effects to traditional NSAIDs (exempli gratia raised blood pressure, peripheral edema), but subsequent studies revealed an increased incidence of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events, leading to withdrawal of some of these agents from the market . How should NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors be prescribed? In general, extra caution should be exercised when using these drugs in elderly patients, as there are higher incidences of important side effects, including confusion . In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended the routine addition of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to either a traditional NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor to reduce the risk of GI side effects . If a person is using ASA for modest CV risk, then most NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated . It is worth monitoring blood pressure and occasionally renal function in people using NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors in the long term . The use of opioids always requires careful consideration of the patient's age, general state, comorbidities and other medications . However, guidance varies by country; because of increases in overdose and other adverse events, in the USA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended that opioids should not be used as first-line pharmacological therapy for chronic pain . It is worth considering the likely duration of effect of a pharmacological intervention, especially in people who only use analgesics intermittently . For many people with OA, symptoms are worse in the latter half of the day, and taking a short-acting agent at lunchtime and/or at evening-meal time may provide maximal short-term benefits .","Paracetamol (acetaminophen), topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and capsaicin are well-tolerated early pharmacological interventions in osteoarthritis (OA). Traditional NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are effective but have a range of important side effects that must be taken into consideration, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks. Care should be taken with the use of opioids for chronic OA pain. Optimal timing of analgesia should be considered in relation to when the patient has most symptoms and the likely duration of effect of the pharmacological intervention."
9781912776238,ch8,"These committees also consider the impact of products on workflow and patient throughput, and the indications for the biosimilar within the organization . These next chapters explore many of the issues that drive these decisions: this one looks at primarily pharmaceutical issues and the following ones look at some of the clinical discussions that might arise when considering biosimilars for formulary inclusion . The decision-making group will have to satisfy itself of how the safety and efficacy data compare with those of the reference drug for the specific patient populations under consideration . The amount and quality of available clinical data, particularly for the indications under consideration for formulary inclusion, and any post-approval data should be considered . Pre- and post-approval clinical data may reveal differences in immunogenic profile (such as infusion reactions, neutralizing antibodies or loss of efficacy) between approved biosimilars and their reference products . As an illustration of the type of event that may occur, we can consider the increase in antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) that was seen in patients with chronic renal failure and using the biological drug recombinant human erythropoietin in Europe between 2002 and 2003 . Any differences from the reference in product characteristics (such as formulation and excipients) or compatibility (such as interference with laboratory assays or a difference in adverse events) should be considered in light of the specific patient groups in question . A patient population needs a reliable and consistent supply of a biologic, given potential problems with changing products . Differences between the biosimilar and its reference product, or between biosimilars, in storage requirements (such as volume of packaging, shelf life, temperature, light sensitivity) may translate into practical difficulties if they are not adequately assessed at an early stage . Are there differences in the timing of administration that might increase the indirect costs of the product? It is prudent to consider not just compatibility of the biosimilar compared with the reference, but also whether there are differences in technician time and preparatory techniques . There are economies to be made by stocking only one brand, but there are costs associated with switching that must be considered, as this involves allocating expert staff time to consulting with patients . Crucially, the Cancer Vanguard policy recognizes that brand switching entails extra immediate costs and it provides reimbursement for this if switching targets are met; this is typically a short-term target for 90% of new patients to be started on the best-value biological product within 3 months of its release and 80% of existing patients to be switched to a biosimilar within 12 months . The cost of the biosimilar versus the reference product should be considered in the context of financial arrangements that favor one product or the other . Differences in costs between biosimilars and their reference products should be carefully evaluated in the context of manufacturer assistance programs . If the biosimilar manufacturer does not provide an assistance program similar to that of the reference product, this may weaken the case for including the biosimilar .","A number of product characteristics and manufacturer processes need to be considered when adopting a biosimilar. A biosimilar may have effects that impact nursing time, patient comfort and ease of use, and these should be evaluated at the outset. Economic estimations should address the potential direct and indirect costs of the biosimilar versus the reference drug."
9783318066241,ch8,"IAP is measured in patients in an intensive care unit setting via an indwelling urinary catheter (transbladder technique) and is usually 5-7 mmHg in critically ill adults . Moderate-to-severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with increased vascular permeability (resulting in interstitial edema), retroperitoneal inflammation and collections and with paralytic ileus; it may also be associated with ascites . These factors increase IAP and may result in intra-abdominal hypertension (a sustained IAP >= 12 mmHg) . Patients with intra-abdominal hypertension are at risk of developing organ failure (OF), as increased pressure in the abdomen may collapse blood vessels, resulting in gastrointestinal tract and kidney ischemia and decreased cardiac output . Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained increase in IAP (> 20 mmHg) that is associated with new organ dysfunction/failure . Very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared aggressive versus conservative treatment of pancreatitis-associated ACS . In critically ill patients with increasing IAP, some non-invasive measures may be useful . In cases of refractory intra-abdominal hypertension, and particularly in cases of organ dysfunction, percutaneous drainage of collections may decrease IAP and improve outcomes . Patients with no response can undergo abdominal decompression surgery (Figure 8.1) . This complication is called disconnected tail syndrome (DTS) or disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome . DTS is associated with bulky retroperitoneal collections, pancreatic ascites, pancreatic pleural effusion (Figure 8.3) and/or pancreaticocutaneous fistula . Octreotide, a somatostatin analog that inhibits the secretion of pancreatic juice, does not seem to be useful in managing DTS . Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography together with pancreatic stenting of the disrupted duct will do little to solve the problem, as a necrotic collection is present and may become infected . However, in cases of DTS, early removal of the stent will probably result in the collection relapsing, so the use of LAMS in this kind of endoscopic drainage is discouraged . In cases of partial main pancreatic duct disruption, retrospective data suggest that bridging of the disruption using a transpapillary pancreatic stent may improve outcomes . AP results in local inflammation and may expose surrounding tissues to pancreatic enzymes . The eventual rupture of a pseudoaneurysm into the retroperitoneum, abdomen, gut, bile duct (hemobilia) or pancreatic duct (hemosuccus pancreaticus) may be associated with massive bleeding . A case series study found that, overall, 20% of patients diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm due to acute or chronic pancreatitis died . The treatment of choice for pseudoaneurysms due to acute or chronic pancreatitis is selective angiographic embolization . Retrospective data suggest that almost 2% of patients overall, and almost 20% of patients with severe AP, develop peripancreatic vein thrombosis (PVT) . PVT is associated with local complications of AP because inflammation and local compression of the veins are important prothrombotic factors . PVT is usually an incidental finding on a contrast-enhanced CT scan performed to look for or control pancreatic or peripancreatic collections and necrosis . Left-sided portal hypertension with collateral circulation on imaging is a frequent consequence of PVT if it is not promptly treated, but bleeding due to esophageal or gastric varices is uncommon, affecting 2.2% of patients with PVT according to a retrospective study .","Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg that is associated with new organ dysfunction/failure. When non-invasive measures fail in ACS, neuromuscular blockade with artificial respiration, percutaneous drainage or, finally, decompressive surgery may be indicated. Disconnected tail syndrome may be associated with bulky retroperitoneal collections, pancreatic ascites, pancreatic pleural effusion and/or pancreaticocutaneous fistula. If indicated, the treatment of choice for disconnected tail syndrome is long-term double-pigtail plastic stent drainage with or without transpapillary main pancreatic duct stenting. A pancreatic pseudoaneurysm should be treated with selective angiographic embolization. Although bleeding varices are uncommon, peripancreatic vein thrombosis should be diagnosed during the index hospital admission and patients should receive prompt anticoagulation therapy."
9781908541406,ch_5,"Most patients with HHT have cutaneous and visceral arteriovenous malformations; those with type 1 disease have epistaxis and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations at a younger age, while hepatic involvement is limited to those with type 2 disease . Cutaneous telangiectasias typically have small feeding vessels, blanch with pressure and bleed freely when traumatized . Telangiectasias are ubiquitous in the gastrointestinal tract, and chronic bleeding results in iron-deficiency anemia . Cutaneous telangiectasias are commonly observed in pregnancy and liver disease, and are usually located on the face and chest; however, in HHT they are found on the hands and fingertips as well (Figure 3.1) . Recurrent episodes of nose bleeding or gastrointestinal hemorrhage result in severe iron-deficiency anemia requiring lifelong iron replacement therapy, either orally or by regular intravenous infusions . Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, is reported to provide long-term control of bleeding . Scurvy is a manifestation of vitamin C deficiency characterized by bleeding gums, perifollicular hemorrhages (Figure 3.2) and large ecchymoses on the buttocks and thighs . Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a form of immune vasculitis affecting venules in the skin, joints, intestinal mucosa and kidney . Deposits of immune complexes containing immunoglobulin (Ig) A can be identified in the circulation and in the walls of inflamed vessels . In a series of 20 patients, seven (35%) who experienced severe Henoch-Schönlein purpura in childhood progressed to renal impairment in adulthood . Although some have urged categorizing Henoch-Schönlein purpura with cutaneous vasculitis (palpable purpura), there appear to be sufficient characteristic features (the IgA deposits, and the involvement of joints, intestinal mucosa and kidney) and risk of late renal sequelae to justify considering it as a specific entity . Once the diagnosis is established, usually by biopsy of skin or renal lesions, steroid therapy should be initiated . Deposition of these complexes on the endothelium of small vessels leads to vascular obstruction and hemorrhage . About 75% of patients have polyarthropathy and 50% develop renal involvement, usually glomerulonephritis . Deposition of immune complexes in skin venules is associated with a palpable purpura . After 1 year of treatment, patients receiving rituximab had earlier complete remissions, a higher rate of immunologic responses, and more complete remissions of renal involvement . In 10 patients refractory to anti-HCV and rituximab therapy, IL-2 resulted in a reduction of cryoglobulinemia in 9, improvement of vasculitis in 8, and an increase in T-regulatory cells in all . Deposition of this amyloid in blood vessels markedly increases their fragility . Minor trauma, such as sneezing or putting the head in a dependent position will cause small vessels to rupture and result in skin hemorrhage (Figure 3.5) . A different form of amyloid is found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease, where it appears in plaques and in the walls of blood vessels . The presence of amyloid in cerebral vessels (found in 10% of those over 65 years of age and in 80% of patients with Alzheimer's disease) may also provide an explanation for the relatively high incidence of cerebral hemorrhage when these patients are treated with tissue plasminogen activator .","Individuals with recurrent nosebleeds and a family history of epistaxis should be carefully evaluated for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Henoch-Schönlein purpura in childhood may lead to complications in pregnancy and renal failure in adulthood. Palpable purpura, renal disease, polyarthropathy and cryoglobulinemia are usually associated with hepatitis C infection."
9781908541703,ch_10,"The clinical trial process may be our most powerful analytical tool for developing and testing new treatments . It must also be remembered that no trial can supplant good clinical observation, the insight that develops a new hypothesis or the basic scientific discovery or technological advance that prompts the trial . By all means, if the question is good, the design makes an answer feasible and entry does not compromise the individual patient's care . However, clinical trials place a burden on all involved, because the data must be meticulously collected and analyzed; a good trial design will make this as easy as possible . If your patient is one of the first to be entered into a trial with a 5-year follow-up, then - barring an unexpectedly dramatic result - you may not know the outcome for a decade . Finally, an admission of uncertainty (a true equipoise between the two treatments being compared) by the physician is implicit in a randomized trial, which can be difficult for some patients (and physicians) to accept . The purpose of a clinical trial is to conduct a human experiment that is likely to provide an answer to a clinical or a biological question (or both) . In a randomized trial, this introduces the concept of 'equipoise', which means that each arm of the study has equal merit in advance of the experiment . The patient may decline to enter the trial, or withdraw at any time during the study, without prejudicing their subsequent care . The Phase I study involves a small number of participants, and provides basic pharmacological and toxicological information . For drugs with relatively non-toxic mechanisms of action (exempli gratia endocrine agents), Phase I studies may be carried out in healthy volunteers; trials on cancer chemotherapy agents are almost always conducted in major cancer centers and involve patients in whom all other available treatment has failed . A Phase II study may test drug combinations or newer approaches to treatment with (but not necessarily) new technology: for example, a Phase II study of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy boost using Intrabeam found the approach to be safe, feasible and efficacious with a lower than expected recurrence rate on long-term follow-up . Phase II studies are not usually randomized . Phase II studies are not usually randomized . The Phase III study is a randomized trial comparing the effects of different treatments, one of which represents the current 'state of the art' . Because the differences in outcome between groups are often expected to be small, these trials involve many patients; they are conducted over several years and involve many institutions in many different countries . Clinical research groups' trials . The UK Department of Health has established a National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) to encourage clinical trial activity . One of its stated aims is to raise recruitment from 3% to 10% of eligible cancer patients; indirectly, this endorses the process as integral to good clinical practice . This mirrors numerous national and regional efforts to accrue patients rapidly and advance clinical science .",The well-conducted clinical trial remains the benchmark of both therapy and medical progress. The patient must be an informed and willing participant in the study. Patient safety is of primary concern in a trial. The clinical trial process needs to be encouraged within routine clinical practice.
9781910797495,chp2,"For the busy clinician, a handy mnemonic for assessing the patient's pain history and pattern is PQRSTU (Table 2.1) . Clearly, the history, physical examination and any laboratory evaluation performed to assess chronic pain may overlap with those carried out for general medical diagnosis and therapy . These patients may simultaneously experience: acute and chronic pain; somatic and neuropathic pain related to the primary diagnosis or its treatment; the effects of mood state on pain; or pain from unrelated, possibly pre-existing, common medical conditions affecting the nervous and/or musculoskeletal systems (exempli gratia neuropathies, spinal pain, arthritis) . Because of the multiple and evolving etiologies of pain, each time a clinician assesses any patient at risk of undertreated pain there must be a fresh evaluation of the pain . Unless pain is assessed systematically and classified according to its likely origin as well as its temporal pattern, aggravating and ameliorating factors and perpetuating factors and comorbidities, then the patient is at risk of receiving suboptimal treatment . When taking the patient's pain history, aspects that should be obtained and recorded in detail include: location, duration, type and intensity of the pain; exacerbating or alleviating factors; previous treatments and response to them; and the meaning of the pain to the patient and their family (Table 2.2) . The patient's self-report is a more accurate assessment of pain than vital signs, outward behavior or observer estimates; however, the last is, by default, important in neonates, infants and individuals of any age with severe cognitive impairment or poor language skills . Identification of pain radiation, where present, may be of assistance in evaluating the possible source of pain (exempli gratia pain from a compressed spinal nerve may radiate down the leg to the foot or down the arm to the hand) . The pain, enjoyment and general activity (PEG) scale, a three-question tool that assesses pain intensity, mood and effects on function, has been validated for use in primary care (see Figure 2.2) . Clinicians often anchor the numeric scale numbers with adjectives denoting levels of both pain intensity and function, giving the numbers consensual meaning between patient and clinician . Musculoskeletal examination is important for all patients because of secondary pain related to postural changes, and deconditioning resulting in muscle atrophy, as well as the adoption of abnormal patterns of movement and loss of range of movement in the spine and various joints . Thus, it is important to monitor how pain and its treatment affect function, daily activities, mood, sleep patterns and other aspects of HRQoL . Scales such as the Brief Pain Inventory, which evaluates pain intensity and the effect of pain on mood, sleep, social function and activities, are commonly used to monitor the effects of treatment from visit to visit . Recently, it has been recognized that there is a spectrum of responses that require assessment of 'risk of substance abuse' in each patient using opioids, benzodiazepines or other medications associated with physical dependence and the potential for addiction . Imaging tests can help physicians confirm or rule out diagnoses suggested by findings in the medical history or physical examination .","A thorough evaluation of pain history and a detailed examination are the foundations for a rational treatment plan. Persistent pain is a disease entity per se that can undermine many dimensions of health-related quality of life. The patient's pain history should document the onset, location, radiation, duration, type (character) and intensity of pain, exacerbating or alleviating factors, previous treatments and response to them, and the meaning of the pain to the patient and their family. Assessment of patients with chronic pain should include a physical examination with particular attention to neurological and musculoskeletal function, a psychosocial assessment and, when appropriate, diagnostic testing such as imaging. Particular attention must be paid to risks for addiction and/or overdose before prescribing, and during a course of, opioid analgesics."
9781910797426,ch10,"Hereditary pancreatitis represents a rare cause of chronic pancreatitis and is associated mostly with mutations in the protease serine 1 (PRSS1) gene . In addition to PRSS1 mutations, other mutations, primarily mutations in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genes, are involved in the etiopathogenesis of hereditary pancreatitis . Patients can have severe episodes of acute recurrent pancreatitis, which lead to chronic pancreatitis with calcifications, and possibly exocrine and endocrine insufficiency . By the age of 70 years, 60% of patients with hereditary pancreatitis will develop exocrine insufficiency, including all of the expected symptoms of steatorrhea and weight loss . Exocrine and endocrine failure develop in a much higher proportion of patients with hereditary pancreatitis than those with either idiopathic or alcoholic pancreatitis, but the time until failure is longer . After exclusion of common etiologic factors (alcohol, occult pancreatic tumor, hypertriglyceridemia, duct obstruction, trauma, pancreas divisum, autoimmune pancreatitis and hyperparathyroidism) as well as hereditary pancreatitis, it has no apparent cause other than a genetic predisposition . There are two types of idiopathic pancreatitis: the most common is early onset (child or young adult), whereas the other occurs in much older patients . The histological and radiological features of these three types of chronic pancreatitis (hereditary, idiopathic and alcohol-related) are indistinguishable . The genes responsible and their association with the different types of pancreatitis are outlined in Figure 10.1 shows the mechanisms by which mutation in PRSS1 and SPINK1 result in inappropriate trypsin activity within the pancreatic parenchyma . The distinction between hereditary pancreatitis and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis requires a careful family history (Figure 10.2) . For a diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis, there should be at least two first-degree relatives in two or more generations with proven chronic pancreatitis . Genetic testing of symptomatic children of an individual with the condition may be considered as this may help clinical diagnosis and management . The nature of the abdominal pain seen in hereditary pancreatitis is commonly misdiagnosed in children and young adults; this fact, coupled with the reduced penetrance, often leads to clinical confusion and a failure to identify the existence of close relatives with pancreatitis . Patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis are at high risk of having a CFTR mutation; this may have significant implications for people planning to have children, particularly in areas where there are many carriers of the mutated CFTR gene in the general population . The median age for presentation for hereditary pancreatitis is around 12 years, but presentation is earlier in children with an R122H mutation (10 years) than in other patients (15 years) . Young adults with hereditary or idiopathic chronic pancreatitis may be diagnosed with celiac disease or irritable bowel syndrome . From the age of 40 years, patients with hereditary pancreatitis should be counseled regarding regular secondary screening for the detection of pancreatic cancer . Routine genetic counseling and gene testing in regional pancreas centers for all families with hereditary and idiopathic pancreatitis .","Patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis are likely to carry cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) mutations in one or both alleles of the gene (compound heterozygotes). Children and young adults are often misdiagnosed with other gastrointestinal diseases. There is a lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer (35%), as well as a high risk of diabetes mellitus and exocrine insufficiency. Patients should undergo genetic counseling prior to genetic testing, and from the age of 40 years patients should be offered secondary screening for cancer in a regional pancreas cancer center. Alcohol and tobacco consumption should be strongly discouraged."
9781908541062,ch_7,"The serum titer of RF does not generally correlate with disease activity, except in patients with vasculitis (see 5 . They may also be present many years before symptomatic onset of RA (see Chapter 2), ultimately appearing in a similar proportion of patients as RF . The identification of the ACPA targets that are most closely associated with RA is an area of active research because this should provide clues to etiology and pathogenesis . As with RF the presence of ACPA, particularly when present at high titer, is associated with more aggressive RA . Anti-nuclear antibodies are present in approximately 40% of RA patients, usually at low titer, and have minimal diagnostic or prognostic value . A potential association with more aggressive disease or vasculitis requires confirmation . X-rays are often normal in RA at presentation, or may just show soft-tissue swelling and periarticular osteoporosis around affected joints . In later disease, erosions spread to the subchondral areas, joint-space narrowing occurs and ultimately subluxation, secondary osteoarthritis and even bony ankylosis may ensue . The rate of development of these changes varies greatly between patients and depends both on therapy and the aggressiveness of the underlying disease . If changes are present these are important prognostically (Chapter 7) but may also help in the differential diagnosis from, for example, inflammatory osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis and gout . In contrast to conventional X-rays, high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS) and MRI may show significant abnormalities in the patient with a very recent onset of joint symptoms . MRI detects the water content of tissues, and readily demonstrates articular and periarticular structures (Figure 6.3) . In the patient with early RA, inflamed synovium appears as a high signal on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images, and enhances further with the paramagnetic contrast agent gadolinium-DTPA . For example, smaller MRI magnets are now available for the study of peripheral joints, providing high-resolution images in an office setting . MRI is the investigation of choice for imaging the rheumatoid cervical spine, however, where it provides high-resolution images of the spinal canal and cord . HRUS is also useful for imaging tendons and soft tissues, for example in the hands or at the shoulder or ankle where symptoms may be secondary to arthritis, bursitis, tendinitis or fasciitis (see Figure 6.4) . Rheumatologists themselves are now becoming trained in the use of HRUS, which is therefore becoming an office, clinic room or bedside aid to the diagnosis, assessment and management of joint disease . It is important to appreciate that the macroscopic appearance of synovial fluid is not a reliable guide to the underlying diagnosis . In established RA, investigations are aimed at determining disease activity, documenting damage and monitoring drug therapy . Any patient with poorly controlled disease, particularly if taking glucocorticoid therapy, should be considered for osteoporosis screening by dual emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) or an alternative modality . Initial investigations of inflammatory arthritis (Table 6.1) are guided, on the one hand, by the differential diagnosis (see Table 5.1) and, on the other, by predictors of damage or prognosis (see Chapter 7) .","In the acute setting the investigation of polyarthritis is guided primarily by the differential diagnosis. There are no pathognomonic tests for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and investigations may be completely normal at presentation. Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) are highly specific for RA and have a sensitivity of up to 75%. Conventional X-rays may provide diagnostic information but are less sensitive than MRI and high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS), although MRI and HRUS continue to be validated. In the chronic setting, investigations are useful for determining disease activity, monitoring therapy and documenting and monitoring joint damage."
9783318066685,ch3,"The first clinical trial in human gene therapy was reviewed by the RAC and initiated at the NIH Clinical Center in 1990 (the goal of the trial was to treat immune-deficient children born with adenosine deaminase [ADA] deficiency using retroviral gene transfer to T cells) . Over the years, major concerns about gene therapy included the (at least theoretical) possibility of germline transmission, the potential for severe immunotoxicities and the risk of insertional mutagenesis, among others . Despite a lack of RCR, at least early-generation murine retroviral vectors unfortunately still have the potential to cause cancer development on gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); while this risk is substantially lower for differentiated cells such as lymphocytes . Interestingly, a murine retroviral vector similar to those used in the initial SCID-X1 trials did not cause leukemia on HSC gene transfer for a different primary immune deficiency, namely ADA deficiency-severe combined immunodeficiency [ADA-SCID]) . Another example of insertional mutagenesis after HSC gene transfer with first-generation LTR-driven gammaretroviral vectors comes from the first clinical trial for the treatment of the X-linked primary immune deficiency Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, conducted in Germany . Recent trials in Europe and the USA utilize a lentiviral vector and a human endogenous promoter to achieve therapeutic gene expression on autologous HSC gene transfer in patients with WASP . Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are a major limitation for in vivo gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, prompting the development of diverse viral capsids that can infect the desired target tissues while being less likely to be neutralized . For gene therapy protocols that may require re-administration, immune suppression may have to be employed at the time of the initial vector injection . For some viral vectors such as adenovirus, innate immune responses can be very potent and thus potentially life-threatening, resulting in activation of endothelial cells or platelets and subsequent changes in blood pressure and dysregulation of coagulation and/or severe inflammation in multiple organs . As a result of more extensive investigation of the innate immune response to adenoviral vectors, their use in gene therapy is now much more limited . In addition to NAb formation against the vector, as explained above, antibody and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses to the transgene product are a concern in gene therapy . The risk for such immune responses is influenced by multiple factors, including the type and specific design of the vector, vector dose and route of administration/target tissue . Improvement in vector potency - for example, by engineering more potent expression cassettes, using hyperactive variants of the therapeutic protein or developing viral capsids or envelopes with stronger tropism for the target cell type - results in efficacy at lower vector doses and, in turn, in lower immune responses to the vector . While targeted vectors with receptor specificity are being developed, most vectors currently used in human gene therapy are not specific to cell type . In some cases, this may be desirable if multiple cell types need to be gene corrected to achieve therapy .","Gene therapy is a relatively new type of medicine that is closely monitored and regulated. Some gene therapies have a risk of cancer development (due to insertional mutagenesis), toxicities, unwanted immune reactions or off-target effects. In each case, a risk-benefit analysis provides guidance for patient selection and potential protocol modifications. Continued development of safer gene therapy vectors and protocols mitigates risks and makes gene therapy available to a broader patient population. Although opinions on the ethical implications are diverse, the prevailing view on gene editing is that applications should, at least currently, be restricted to somatic cells because there are still many unknowns about this novel technology. The costs of gene therapy are high, but these therapies could actually provide healthcare systems with savings over time; outcomes-based pricing is one proposed model."
9781910797457,chp9,"Primary care practitioners and allied healthcare professionals have an important role here: good management of treatment effects and complications can unquestionably improve the quality of life of affected men and should be incorporated into the routine care of all prostate cancer survivors . Treatment of localized prostate cancer often results in sexual dysfunction . Improvements in techniques for radical prostatectomy and nerve sparing, such as the use of robotic assistance, have resulted in significant improvements in this area; however, erectile dysfunction can occur following even the most expert surgery . Early administration of pharmaceutical treatments for erectile dysfunction soon after surgery has been shown to improve the time and quality of subsequent erections . Men who undergo radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for localized prostate cancer may also experience ejaculatory problems, although the sensation of orgasm is usually preserved . Therapy with an antiandrogen can effectively deprive prostate cancer cells of androgen stimulation without such a profound effect on libido or erectile function . Men with prostate cancer, and their partners, should be counseled not only about probable outcomes, but also about the likely effect of the disease and its therapy on sexual activity . An open and informed approach to this important aspect of prostate cancer will do much to counter the anxiety and loss of self-esteem that often accompany the diagnosis of this prevalent malignancy, and to restore effective sexual function after treatment and thereby maintain an important aspect of quality of life . Prospective clinical trials of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with prostate cancer have highlighted multiple risk factors for bone health and cardiovascular disease, including increases in serum cholesterol and triglycerides, insulin resistance, body mass index and fat body mass, and decrease in lean body mass (Table 9.1) . Loss of bone mineral density (BMD) with ADT for prostate cancer is well recognized, with significant loss within 12 months of starting therapy; the annual loss is 2-8% per year at the lumbar spine and 2-6% at the hip . Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid [zoledronate], pamidronic acid [pamidronate] and alendronic acid [alendronate]) have been shown to prevent bone loss in prospective studies in men receiving ADT, and increased BMD in one randomized controlled trial . Further prospective trials are required to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bisphosphonates in men with prostate cancer who require ADT . Until the results from these trials become available, suggestions for the management of bone effects in men receiving ADT include baseline and yearly measurements of BMD . Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors (exempli gratia fasting hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased serum high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, increases in waist circumference and waist to hip ratio, and hypertension) that have been reported to be increased in men receiving ADT . reported that, in men over 65 years, treatment with ADT decreased the time to fatal myocardial infarction compared with men not receiving this therapy . A number of large studies have reported a 19-49% increase in the risk of developing diabetes in men receiving ADT .","Men with prostate cancer require emotional support as well as information on probable outcomes and the effects of the disease and its treatment. Sexual dysfunction is a common sequela of prostate cancer treatment. An open and informed discussion with the patient and his partner will do much to counter anxiety and loss of self-esteem. Erectile dysfunction can often be improved with phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, prostaglandin suppositories or injections, or mechanical vacuum devices. Loss of libido can be reduced by using antiandrogens to treat prostate cancer in preference to bilateral orchidectomy or a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analog/antagonist. Osteoporosis and fractures are side effects of long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT): vitamin D status should be evaluated before starting ADT, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation, as well as isometric exercises, encouraged during treatment. It is prudent to weigh the risks and benefits of ADT in men with cardiovascular risk factors and to monitor all risk factors during therapy. At-risk patients should be advised to make lifestyle changes as appropriate (exempli gratia stop smoking, lose weight, increase physical activity, improve diet)."
9781908541062,ch_4,"The synoviocytes ignore their normal tissue boundaries and migrate onto the articular cartilage, where the secretion of cytokines and cartilage- and bone-degrading enzymes results in the characteristic destructive changes of RA . A search for pivotal regulatory cytokines suggested that synovial TNF could orchestrate the expression of other pro-inflammatory mediators, and subsequent studies in animal models and then in humans have shown TNF blockade to be a useful therapeutic strategy for RA (see Chapter 9) . For example, cell-to-cell contact between activated T cells and synovial monocytes is a stimulus to TNF production and the rheumatoid synovium is heavily infiltrated with a variety of immune and inflammatory cells . The 'signature' cytokine of this subset, IL-17, has pleiotropic actions relevant to RA: endothelial cell activation, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8), and RANKL induction on chondrocytes and osteoblasts, leading to osteoclast activation . In addition to producing autoantibodies, B cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (including TNF and IL-6), and are also efficient antigen-presenting cells . Macrophages are almost certainly the major 'factory' for pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA, and recently there has been renewed interest in the potential role of mast cells in the disease . They are also present in rheumatoid synovium and could play an important role in disease pathogenesis . Their expression is stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, TNF and IL-17, and results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells via counter-receptors such as the integrin leukocyte function-associated molecule-1 (LFA-1) and very late activation antigen-4 (VLA-4) . Further progress of inflammatory cells into the joint is stimulated by chemokines, of which there is an abundance in the rheumatoid synovium . These include monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1 [also known as chemokine {C-C motif} ligand 2 or CCL2]), IL-8 (also known as C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 or CXCL8), regulated upon activation, normally T expressed, and presumably secreted (RANTES [also known as chemokine {C-C motif} ligand 5 or CCL5]), monocyte chemoattractant protein 4 (MCP-4 [chemokine {C-C motif} ligand 13 or CCL13]), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 [also known as chemokine {C-X-C motif} ligand 12 or CXCL12]), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1-alpha [also known as chemokine {C-C motif} ligand 3 or CCL3) and fractalkine (chemokine [C-X3-C motif] ligand 1 or CX3CL1) . Furthermore, it is now recognized that the pathology of atherosclerosis bears many resemblances to that of RA, in terms of cellular and pro-inflammatory mediators, as well as in the destructive enzymes that result in plaque rupture . Relatively few apoptotic cells are present in rheumatoid synovium, however, despite pro-apoptotic stimuli such as hypoxia and TNF . This is a transmembrane protein induced on fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and osteoblasts by pro-inflammatory cytokines, and a soluble form is secreted by activated T cells . There they activate macrophages expressing Fcgamma receptors (receptors for IgG), which then produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to further inflammatory cell influx . They secrete TNF, IL-1 and IL-6, three of the pivotal cytokines in RA, and studies have shown a correlation between the number of synovial macrophages and the degree of joint destruction .","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease initially localized to the joint lining. Dominant features are synovial inflammation, and proliferation and outgrowth of the synovial lining layer, with destruction of articular cartilage and bone. Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a pivotal role in RA pathology. The primary pathogenic event may reside within the immune system or in the synovial lining. However, data from genome-wide association studies and preclinical autoantibody development suggest primary immune dysregulation. Accelerated cardiovascular disease in RA may be secondary to inflammation or intrinsic to the disease process. The inter-relationship between the immune system and bone is receiving increasing attention (osteoimmunology)."
9781905832729,ch_7,"Urinary tract pathology is found in 2-10% of patients under the age of 50 years with microscopic hematuria . Urinary tract malignancy is rarely seen in patients under 40 years of age . Over 50 years, 10-20% of patients with microscopic hematuria will have significant urinary tract pathology . Flow charts for the investigation of hematuria, as recommended in 2001 by the American Urologic Association Best Practice Policy Panel on Asymptomatic Microhematuria in Adults are shown in Figures 6.1 and 6.2 . Hematuria identified by dipstick urinalysis should always be investigated further by urine microscopy . Microscopic hematuria is present if more than three red blood cells per high-power field are visible in urinary sediment from two out of three freshly voided, clean-catch midstream urine samples . Misshapen red blood cells are usually glomerular in origin, whereas normal red blood cells generally come from the lower urinary tract . Urine should be tested for proteinuria, which may be a sign of renal pathology or an extrarenal medical disorder . Ultrasonography of the renal tract is the preferred initial imaging technique for identifying renal parenchymal disease, hydronephrosis and stone fragments . If hydronephrosis is found, the entire renal tract should be investigated . Ultrasonography can be used to detect and characterize renal masses but is unreliable in detecting upper tract urothelial tumors . Plain abdominal radiography is useful to detect calcification due to renal tract stones, which affect about 5% of the population . Intravenous urography (IVU) was traditionally the modality of choice for imaging the urinary tract, and some still consider it to be the best imaging test for the initial evaluation of microscopic hematuria . CT is more sensitive for detecting small renal masses, and is the investigation of choice for detecting renal tract stones - it is extremely sensitive (94-98%) compared with IVU (52-59%) and ultrasonography (19%) . CT is used to detect and characterize solid renal masses as well as renal and perirenal infections and associated complications . In European countries, the investigation of hematuria is often carried out in 'one-stop' clinics with facilities for cytology, ultrasonography and flexible cystoscopy, the aim being to make the diagnosis in a single outpatient visit . Patients with stones or renal tumors should be referred to the appropriate urologist . Patients with significant proteinuria, renal insufficiency, or red blood cell casts or dysmorphic red blood cells on microscopy should be referred to a nephrologist for evaluation of renal parenchymal disease, which may necessitate a percutaneous renal biopsy . Investigation finds no cause for microscopic hematuria in many patients . Although most urology specialists/one-stop clinics will discharge these patients, it has been suggested that repeat urinalysis, cytology and blood pressure monitoring is required . Unexplained frank hematuria requires more extensive investigation . Hematuria can originate from anywhere along the urinary tract and may be an indicator of underlying pathology . Dipstick testing is sensitive but is not specific, and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between 'physiological' amounts of blood in the urine and blood that is the result of pathology .","Blood in the urine can originate from anywhere along the urinary tract and may indicate underlying pathology. Dipstick testing is sensitive but does not distinguish between physiological and pathological amounts of blood. The most common causes of hematuria are stones, infection, nephritis and prostate enlargement. Malignancy becomes more likely in patients over 50 years of age and who smoke. Some drugs can cause hematuria. The morphology of red blood cells may distinguish between glomerular and lower urinary tract causes. Investigation of hematuria can be in a 'one-stop' clinic with facilities for cytology, ultrasonography and flexible cystoscopy so that diagnosis can be made in one visit. Ultrasonography is useful for identifying renal parenchymal disease and urinary tract obstruction. Radiography will identify stones. CT scanning is highly sensitive for detecting stones, renal masses and infections. Management depends on the underlying cause identified. Unexplained hematuria should be followed up with repeat tests at a later date."
9781912776726,ch1,"The worldwide incidence of intrinsic brain tumors (benign and malignant) is an estimated 26 per 100 000 person-years, while the overall age-adjusted incidence of gliomas ranges from 4.67 to 5.73 per 100 000 people . Molecular studies have identified key genetic mutations associated with glioblastoma (see page 11) . Glioblastomas are malignant intrinsic tumors that are thought to arise from populations of stem/progenitor cells in the brain (Figure 1.2) . Tumors arise as a result of a driver mutation in a cell of origin (exempli gratia astrocyte, oligodendrocyte), which defines the location of the tumor, and occur during a preferred developmental period (exempli gratia childhood versus adult) . Over the past 10 years the combination of location, age and mutation has been used to define many brain tumors (see Classification by genetic mutation, page 11) . With the advent of molecular classification, the terms 'primary' (used to define the 95% of glioblastomas that manifest rapidly without evidence of less malignant precursor lesions) and 'secondary' (used to define the 5% of glioblastomas that develop from lower-grade gliomas) are becoming obsolete . Instead, the histological term 'glioblastoma' comprises several distinct biological entities, underpinned by combinations of genetic mutations and cells of origin, which are described in more detail below . The recognition of genetic mutations has largely superseded the importance of histological appearance in the classification of glioblastomas (see Figure 1.3) . Large-scale studies have found IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas (WHO grades II and III) and in a small proportion of glioblastomas . These tumors can occur in adults of any age, but arise most commonly in individuals of 50-70 years old . Precursor forms of IDH wild-type glioblastoma present on MRI as hyperperfused low-grade diffuse gliomas and do not show high-grade histological features (see Figure 1.3) . The ATRX mutation results in loss of expression in tumor cell nuclei, which can be seen on histological sections (see Table 1.1) . These tumors typically occur in young adults aged 20-40 years and are most frequently located in the frontal, parietal or temporal lobes, but not in the midline . A recent molecular study of IDH -mutant astrocytomas and glioblastomas, combined with outcome data, found that the CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion is associated with poor outcome . These occur in low- and high-grade forms; the latter may have similar histological features to glioblastoma . Oligodendrogliomas occur in people in their 30s and 40s, are usually located in the frontal or parietal lobes, and are defined by the presence of an IDH mutation and loss of heterozygosity on chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q co-deletion) . H3.3 K27M-mutant glioblastomas are most commonly seen in children in the brainstem (so-called diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma), but adult forms are increasingly being recognized . Most BRAF -mutated tumors present as lower-grade gliomas, such as pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma or ganglioglioma, but occasionally they present with high-grade histological features and appear similar to - and are sometimes indistinguishable from - glioblastomas . Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation in glioma cells occurs in about 50% of glioblastomas, increasing chemosensitivity .","Many intrinsic brain tumors can be defined by their driver mutations, some of which are diagnostically and prognostically relevant. For example, the presence of an IDH mutation generally confers a better prognosis than no IDH mutation with chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss (as seen in early forms of glioblastoma or histological classic glioblastoma). IDH -mutant tumors may be astrocytomas or oligodendrogliomas. They occur in people aged 30-40 years and are usually located in the frontal lobe. IDH wild-type glioblastomas occur mostly in older people (50-70 years old). They generally have chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss, and in many cases, EGFR amplification and/or TERT promoter mutation. Gliomas in midline structures are highly likely to have a histone H3.3 K27M mutation. MGMT promoter methylation increases chemosensitivity to temozolomide treatment."
9781908541680,ch_8,"Behavioral therapy - the collective name for the various methods and strategies used to bring about changes in lifestyle - is universally credited as being one of the three main pillars of weight management, alongside dietary modification and increased physical activity (Chapters 5 and) . Changing patients' habits and attitudes using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is key to long-term obesity management . For example, if the first thing an individual does when arriving home from a stressful day is to eat two biscuits, basic dietary and nutritional advice is simple: stop eating biscuits . Behavioral therapy, on the other hand, suggests how to avoid eating the biscuits: the answer could be simple - don't buy any biscuits; or more complex - avoid the stressful situation that triggered the desire to eat biscuits, which may mean changing jobs, or walking home instead of taking a crowded bus . However, a long-term support program that combines behavioral therapy with regular physical activity and dietary advice can be highly successful in improving adherence to lifestyle changes and sustaining weight loss . An individual's likelihood of accepting any lifestyle advice depends on their 'stage of change', which refers to their state of mind and reflects how motivated they are to undergo management for their condition . Self-monitoring: increasing self-awareness of eating patterns and physical activity behavior, which is an essential precursor for change . Stimulus control: avoiding situations that lead to harmful behavior, and promoting situations that influence healthy activity . A food and activity diary should clarify eating patterns and behaviors, particularly events that trigger eating, with a view to changing those patterns once they have been identified, for instance by planning ahead . Long-term weight management has been shown to improve when food records are used . Different stimuli (cues) for eating, only one of which is feeling physically hungry, must first be identified then managed . For example, eating chocolate biscuits on arriving home from work is more likely to be because of stress than hunger; the stimulus control is therefore to remove the biscuit or the stress . Stimulus control might involve avoiding external cues, for instance taking a different route home that avoids passing the temptation of a fast-food outlet . 'Learned self-control' becomes important when the only route home passes the fast-food outlet, making external temptation unavoidable . 'Stress management' is self-explanatory; comfort eating is widely recognized as a reason for overeating . Patients with BED display the features of bulimia nervosa but without the purging, abnormal exercise regimens or other compensatory behavior to induce weight loss (see also Fast Facts: Eating Disorders) . Its features include recurrent episodes of eating objectively large amounts of food within a discrete period of time, a subjective sense of lack of control during each eating episode, binge eating at least 2 days a week on average for 6 months and no regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, id est purging, fasting or excessive exercise . Treatment is predominantly behavioral rather than dietary, initially by persuading patients to have an early substantial breakfast and to regain a normal eating pattern .","Behavioral therapy, alongside diet and lifestyle advice, is one of the three key components of obesity management. A person's degree of motivation and expectations should be assessed. Techniques include goal setting, self-monitoring and stimulus control. Binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome are specific eating disorders and should be treated accordingly."
9781910797457,chp4,"Once a man has undergone a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal exam (DRE), a reasonable level of suspicion for the presence of prostate cancer may arise . Multiparametric MRI is increasingly used before biopsy to identify suspicious lesions within the prostate that would allow targeted biopsy, and may also mean that biopsy can be avoided in some men with normal MRI findings and lower levels of suspicion . Multiparametric (mp) MRI - which is based on four MRI techniques - is increasingly used to identify 'areas of interest', so that biopsies can be better targeted, and to stage prostate cancer . The combination of MRI methods is claimed to significantly improve the detection and local staging of prostate cancer by MRI, and is now widely used before prostate biopsy to target suspicious areas, and to follow up patients managed by active surveillance . Furthermore, in cases where a biopsy is warranted, a negative finding on MRI can provide reassurance to the patient, id est that they don't have prostate cancer . The recently completed PROMIS study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of an mpMRI scan followed by both template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy and standard transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS)-guided biopsy in 576 men with suspected prostate cancer . While this is the most accurate method of targeting a suspicious lesion on MRI, the technique is cumbersome and is not clinically practicable for most patients . Accurate grading and staging of prostate cancer, particularly distinguishing between Gleason grades and between localized and more extensive disease, is critical for selection of the optimum treatment . Although developments in imaging techniques, especially MRI, have led to more accurate staging than can be achieved with DRE or PSA testing alone, both under- and overstaging are still common clinical problems . PSA levels above 20 ng/mL often indicate tumor extension beyond the prostatic capsule, while levels above 40 ng/mL suggest a high likelihood of bony and/or soft tissue metastases (see the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's pretreatment nomogram at) . Men who present with newly diagnosed, well- or moderately well-differentiated prostate cancer, no skeletal symptoms and a serum PSA value of 10 ng/mL or less may not need a staging radionuclide bone scan because the probability of skeletal metastases approaches zero . Carbon-labeled choline PET/CT and gallium-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET imaging (Figure 4.4) are accurate methods for staging advanced disease and are increasingly used to confirm or exclude the presence of soft-tissue or skeletal metastases . While cancer characteristics such as PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage, number of biopsy cores involved and percentage of each core involved provide valuable prognostic information, combining all these variables in a nomogram provides a much more accurate prediction of the outcome . A number of tests that measure gene expression from paraffin-embedded tissue, such as prostate biopsy material, have been evaluated and appear to give prognostic information over and above that of Gleason grade grouping (see pages 14 -) alone . A genomic prostate score allows more accurate risk stratification of patients with low -and intermediate-risk prostate cancer than is possible with the Gleason grade group alone and informs decisions about treatment .","Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed on the basis of transrectal or transperineal biopsy. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The Gleason score of these biopsies, clinical stage on digital rectal exam (DRE) and presenting prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value provide an estimate of the risk of extraprostatic extension. Multiparametric MRI is increasingly used to target biopsies and can provide information about local staging. Bone scanning identifies bone metastases, although the probability of these in patients with PSA below 10 ng/mL is low. PET/CT is useful to detect soft-tissue and bone metastases."
9783318066241,ch1,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a disease caused by acute inflammation of the pancreas . The pancreas is an organ with important exocrine and endocrine functions, including being the main source of digestive enzymes . The exocrine pancreas consists of acinar and ductal cells (Figure 1.1) . Pancreatic acinar cells secrete inactive digestive enzymes (zymogens) in order to protect the pancreas from self-digestion . Trypsin is a key pancreatic enzyme and is secreted as a zymogen called trypsinogen . Once in the duodenum, an enterocyte apical membrane enzyme called enterokinase converts pancreatic trypsinogen to trypsin by limited proteolysis of its eight-amino-acid-long N-terminal activation peptide (Figure 1.2) . Trypsin then activates other molecules of trypsinogen as well as other zymogens into active enzymes . Pancreatic ductal cells secrete water and bicarbonate, which neutralize gastric acid and help to flush pancreatic enzymes into the duodenum . However, the initial step in the pathogenesis of AP is acinar cell injury, which has several important consequences (Figure 1.3) . Altered calcium signaling is associated with destabilization of the secretory zymogen granules and intracellular activation of trypsinogen to trypsin . When an injured cell becomes necrotic, it releases substances that activate inflammation, including so-called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) . Acinar cell injury is associated with the activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa B, which in turn induce the secretion of proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules . These substances are involved in immune cell recruitment to the damaged tissue: neutrophils, monocytes and other cells infiltrate the pancreas and produce inflammation . The initial injury to the acinar cells can block this process of autophagy, leading to trypsinogen activation, cell death and inflammation . Premature intrapancreatic activation of zymogens Altered calcium signaling, inflammation, altered autophagy and genetic mutations in certain proteins (see page 19-22) are associated with intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen to trypsin . In turn, trypsin can activate other zymogens in a cascade reaction that leads to mitochondrial malfunction, cell necrosis and direct self-digestion of the pancreas and its surroundings . Two-thirds of patients will develop a mild and uneventful disease characterized by pancreatic edema (classically termed edematous pancreatitis) and little or no systemic inflammatory response . However, the remaining one-third of patients will develop local and/or systemic complications . Pancreatic gland necrosis results from massive cellular injury mediated by the mechanisms described above and also from damage to the pancreatic microvasculature caused by inflammation . Peripancreatic fat necrosis arises when the fat surrounding the pancreas is affected by inflammation and digestion by pancreatic lipase . These local complications are frequently associated with pain, systemic inflammation, fluid sequestration and sometimes with compression of neighboring structures, leading to intolerance of an oral diet, thrombosis of peripancreatic veins, jaundice or infection . Necrotizing pancreatitis (pancreatic gland and/or peripancreatic fat necrosis) is also associated with a higher risk of systemic inflammatory response syndrome leading to organ failure due to uncontrolled and unbalanced release of proinflammatory mediators .","The pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is incompletely understood. Initial acinar cell injury has several cellular consequences that promote local inflammation. Severe local damage is associated with a systemic inflammatory response, which, when uncontrolled, may progress to organ failure. AP may induce bacterial translocation. Viable bacteria in the bloodstream may colonize necrotic pancreatic and/or peripancreatic tissue resulting in infection."
9781908541703,ch_9,"Metastatic breast cancer is increasingly a chronic and recurrent disease characterized by remission and relapses, but it can lead to oncological emergencies requiring immediate treatment (Table 8.2) . For example, patients with a long disease-free interval after primary treatment, good performance status, small volume disease and so-called 'favorable' disease sites (bone, soft tissue) are likely to do better than patients who relapse very soon after initial adjuvant therapy or who have poor performance status because of high disease burden and possibly multiple disease sites with visceral involvement (liver, lung) . Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive disease should receive anti-HER2 targeted therapy as their main treatment, usually in combination with chemotherapy . However, as this is usually the treatment of choice in adjuvant therapy, most women will have been exposed to tamoxifen and thus ovarian suppression (possibly with an aromatase inhibitor) is preferred for metastatic disease . Evidence from clinical trials has led to the recommendation that an aromatase inhibitor is the standard of care for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer . A recent Phase III randomized trial (BOLERO-2) investigated second-line therapy with everolimus and exemestane compared with exemestane and placebo in 724 patients with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer . All patients in the study had developed recurrence or progression while receiving adjuvant therapy or treatment for advanced disease (or both) . Retrospective analyses have shown that metastatic steroid hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer with concurrent overexpression of HER2 is less responsive to endocrine treatment, especially tamoxifen . It should be recognized, however, that patients with hormone-receptor-positive disease who have overexpression of HER2 do badly and should perhaps be considered for chemotherapy at an early stage in their metastatic disease . Although many patients will have received trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment (see Targeted treatment), those who relapse with metastatic disease should be rechallenged with trastuzumab as first-line therapy, usually in combination with chemotherapy (a taxane), either weekly or 3-weekly . Recent data indicate that, if metastatic disease in visceral sites or bone progresses during treatment with trastuzumab, HER2 suppression should be maintained with trastuzumab in combination with a different cytotoxic drug (exempli gratia vinorelbine or capecitabine) or with lapatinib in combination with capecitabine . Identification of other targets in breast cancer has led to the development of many new targeted therapies, largely comprising monoclonal antibodies or oral small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials either alone or in combination with endocrine treatment or chemotherapy (Table 8.3) . Locally advanced breast cancer or inflammatory breast cancer should be staged to exclude metastatic disease and then managed with systemic treatment, the choice of which will depend on a number of patient and tumor factors, including receptor status . Bone metastases occur in over 70% of patients with metastatic breast cancer and may be solitary or multiple . Hypercalcemia is becoming more uncommon in breast cancer, probably because of more active management of bone disease at an early stage .","Site of recurrence, extent, time to recurrence and evaluation of comorbidities are critical determinants of prognosis and treatment. It is essential to set clearly defined goals of therapy for both the patient and healthcare professionals. Systemic treatment can improve symptoms and, in some cases, prolong survival. Oncological emergencies must be anticipated and recognized. Effective pain management is almost always possible."
9781908541703,ch_5,"A much higher level of accuracy is required for patients with symptomatic lumps: the risk of a false negative is too high (1-10%) with two assessments only (exempli gratia physical examination and imaging), so a tissue sample (preferable to cytology) should be taken in any patient with a clinically or radiologically identifiable lesion . Triple assessment, comprising clinical examination, imaging and pathological evaluation (preferably a core biopsy) will provide a confident diagnosis in 95% of patients with suspected breast cancer, and should be carried out before the patient is discharged . The importance of a thorough history cannot be overemphasized; for example, a history of regular ibuprofen use in a young girl would suggest a diagnosis of fibromatosis for a lump that otherwise may mimic breast cancer . to increase the likelihood of detecting a relatively small cancer in patients whose breasts have a coarse nodular texture . Most importantly, randomized trials have found that MRI does not reduce the necessity for reoperation, the likelihood of recurrence or contralateral breast cancer (incidence is 6% with or without preoperative MRI at 8-year follow-up), and does not improve surgical accuracy . Large series have found that patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery after a preoperative MRI (therefore excluding those in whom additional lesions were found) have the same outcome as those who did not have a preoperative MRI evaluation, suggesting that the lesions found on MRI may never have progressed to a clinical tumor . The Comparative Effectiveness of MRI in Breast Cancer (COMICE) trial that randomized women to either receive or not receive a preoperative MRI, found that MRI does not reduce reoperation rates (even with lobular cancers), but increases the mastectomy rates (7% vs 1%) . If cytological examination of cells obtained by FNAC is equivocal or not concordant with clinical or radiological features, especially in women over 35 years old, a core biopsy should be obtained under local anesthesia using an automatic core biopsy needle (widely available and, in many cases, disposable) . It should be emphasized that routine staging for metastatic spread in early breast cancer, especially when detected by screening or when a node-negative T1 tumor is present, is not advisable as the yield is less than 4% . Since over 90% of breast cancers are first detected by the woman herself, the rationale for regular self-examination is to increase the likelihood of detecting a tumor as early as possible . Screening by regular mammography can reduce the risk of mortality from breast cancer by 20-30% in certain groups . Since 20-30% of breast cancers are not detected by mammography, some tumors could, therefore, be missed . For every breast cancer detected, a substantial number of women will undergo biopsies or surgery for benign breast disease, with attendant morbidity . Many invasive cancers detected by screening would never have progressed to clinical disease . Indeed, two large-scale randomized controlled trials performed in St Petersburg and China found no difference in breast cancer mortality rates between women trained in breast self-examination and a control group .","A logical process for assessing breast pain or masses will greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy. Triple assessment - clinical examination plus imaging plus cytological or histopathological examination - represents the diagnostic gold standard. All suspicious findings on MRI require pathological confirmation. No test is pathognomonic. Clinical judgment has high value. Breast screening programs have modest utility. Their greatest value may be in increasing patient self-awareness and in the improved organization of clinical services. Breast self-examination can no longer be recommended, though women should be aware of normal physiological changes and thus be alerted to the first chance observation of a pathological change."
9781910797006,ch02,"While cigarette smoking, itself now regarded as a disease, is the major risk factor, COPD also occurs in non-smokers and individuals vary greatly in their susceptibility to smoke . Cigarette smoking is the most important etiologic factor for the development of COPD . There is a highly significant dose and duration effect, with smokers having lower lung function the more and longer they smoke . It is likely that smoking contributes to the development of COPD in several distinct ways and at several different periods over the lifespan of the individual (Table 2.1) . Furthermore, the adverse effects of smoking on lung function are likely to be greater the earlier an individual is exposed . Passive exposure to cigarette smoke is an important risk factor and may contribute to the development of COPD in non-smokers . Individuals exposed to dusts and fumes who also smoke cigarettes have the highest risk of developing COPD . The complex interactions between cigarette smoke and the lungs of smokers suggest multiple steps at which individual susceptibility may vary . Consistent with this, smokers show considerable heterogeneity in their susceptibility to developing COPD and strong genetic components appear to be present . Both smoking and non-smoking siblings of individuals with established COPD are at greatly increased risk of lower lung function than are siblings of individuals without COPD . Not surprisingly, a variety of early life events can increase the risk for the development of COPD, presumably by affecting lung growth and development . Some childhood infections have been reported both to reduce lung function in adulthood and to increase the risk of pulmonary symptoms . In addition to acutely altering lung growth and development, some infections may have direct effects in later life . Low socioeconomic status is also a risk factor for the development of COPD and may reflect the association with risk factors such as smoking, occupational exposures and respiratory infections . Airway hyperreactivity is also a risk factor for the development of COPD . Consistent with this, a proportion of patients with asthma appear to have an accelerated rate of decline in lung function suggestive of COPD . There is a significant familial risk of airflow limitation in smoking siblings of patients with severe COPD, suggesting that genetic factors influence the development of the condition (Table 2.2) . People deficient in alpha1-proteinase inhibitor are at increased risk of developing COPD even if they do not smoke, although not all affected individuals develop disease . If such individuals smoke, they are much more likely to develop severe COPD and to develop it at a particularly early age (Figure 2.3) . However, only some non-smokers with alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency develop emphysema . Additional genetic associations that may contribute to COPD risk and that are more common than alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency have been identified, although these are likely to increase the risk of COPD only modestly . It is important, therefore, to view the natural history of COPD not only in terms of the decline in FEV, but also in terms of increasing symptoms .","Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for COPD; about 80% of patients with COPD are, or have been, smokers. Almost all smokers develop impaired lung function. Other influences, including air pollution and occupational exposures, contribute to COPD risk. Individual genetic susceptibility probably accounts for the heterogeneity of COPD risk. It is likely that many specific genetic factors will contribute to COPD risk; alpha1-proteinase inhibitor deficiency is the best characterized of these. Asthma may contribute to COPD risk in some individuals. Early life events, including compromised lung development and growth, are likely to contribute to the risk of developing COPD later. Many individuals with COPD are undiagnosed, as symptoms of dyspnea can be minimized by restricting activity, which leads patients to discount their functional compromise."
9781910797082,ch02,"The classic symmetry, silvery scale and vivid reddish-purple color of lesions (Figure 2.2) allow psoriasis to be easily differentiated from other skin disorders in most cases . Flexural forms (inverse psoriasis), commonly seen in obese patients, occur in normal body folds, such as under the breasts, in the natal cleft and in the inguinal and axillary regions (Figure 2.5) . The first form occurs in association with erythrodermic psoriasis, in which multiple tiny pustules, with or without coalescence, are scattered throughout the inflamed body surface . Although psoriasis is normally considered to be a less itchy condition than eczema, most patients complain of a persistent and uncomfortable itch and find it difficult not to constantly scratch their lesions, especially those on the scalp, leading to a marked increase in thickening (lichenification) of individual plaques . Secondary candidiasis in body folds can also modify psoriasis, as can concurrent disease such as HIV infection, which frequently results in a more inflammatory form of psoriasis, often with severe facial involvement . Scalp involvement may range from a moderate degree of silvery scale resembling seborrheic dermatitis to thick well-circumscribed plaques covering major portions of the scalp surface (Figure 2.7) . The patient's habitual scratching will often modify the psoriasis to produce asymmetrical plaques, particularly on the sides and the posterior scalp . Psoriasis is also one of the most common causes of otitis externa, with a classic silvery scale on an erythematous base extending into the ear canal (Figure 2.8) . Lesions in the folds of the breasts are also common; usually a distinct erythema is present rather than the classic silvery scale (see Figure 2.5) . The pustular variant (see Figure 2.6) has multiple tiny pustules (0.1-0.3 cm in diameter), with or without associated erythema, scaling or crusting of the intervening skin . In men, a well-circumscribed, thin, erythematous lesion is seen on the glans penis, which is usually associated with minimal silvery scales, because of the thinness of the skin in this region . This observation has strong clinical implications and suggests that the management of patients with psoriasis should take into account factors other than the severity of the skin disease . Metabolic syndrome describes a number of clinical features that together largely explain the excess risk of cardiovascular and liver disease in patients with psoriasis . Recent studies show that obesity is much more common in patients with psoriasis, particularly if they have severe disease . Epidemiological studies indicate that cardiovascular disease is more common in patients with psoriasis, and traditional risk factors such as hypertension and obesity also have an increased incidence in these patients (see above) . Furthermore, mortality from cardiovascular disease is 2.6-fold greater in patients with moderate and severe psoriasis than in the general population . While the risk is thought mainly to be associated with concomitant metabolic syndrome (see above), it may also relate to the chronic systemic inflammation that patients with moderate and severe psoriasis experience, and is similar to that seen in other chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, which is also strongly associated with cardiovascular disease .","Psoriasis is a clinical diagnosis; there is no blood test specific for this disease. Chronic discoid plaque psoriasis is the most common subtype of psoriasis. The scalp, elbows, knees and sacrum are the areas most commonly affected by psoriasis. Psoriasis can sometimes be triggered by infection, trauma, stress or medications. Psoriasis is associated with a number of comorbidities that have important health and socioeconomic implications."
9781910797693,chp6,"For originator drugs, the pivotal trial endpoints were disease-free survival and overall survival rates 5 years after treatment . The regulatory's aim for a biosimilar is to show no clinically meaningful difference in efficacy, as determined by the totality of evidence from structural analytics and functional assays of biopotency, and phase I and III trials to show comparable safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints . Whilst regulators are familiar with the issues of extrapolating data between diseases, surveys show that this is the principle barrier to clinician confidence in the use of rituximab biologics . In the case of trastuzumab biosimilars for breast cancer, manufacturers have, as for rituximab, chosen different clinical settings in which to demonstrate equivalence based on phase III PD endpoints . Whilst all these trial designs can provide the PD and safety data to show comparability, as required by regulators, it is potentially confusing for clinicians, who are used to comparing data for identical endpoints for competing treatment options . Amgen proposed that biosimilar bevacizumab-ABP215 has identical primary and secondary structures to the reference drug, but differences in the glycan proportions lie outside the variation shown by the reference drug over time (Figure 6.1) . However, bevacizumab has low immunogenicity, and an immune response is even less likely to be associated with its use in patients receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy for cancer . Equivalence for bevacizumab-ABP215 was shown clinically in a phase III trial involving 578 patients: treatment-induced anti-drug antibodies were found in 2.5% of patients treated with the reference drug, bevacizuamb, and 1.4% of those who received bevacizumab-ABP215 . While this off-label use is not without evidence, and is supported by clinical outcome data from a 2-year Comparison of wet-AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) in the US (results published in 2012), the Inhibition of VEGF in Age-related Choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) trial in the UK (2013), and a Cochrane review, which concluded that bevacizumab and ranibizumab were equally effective . Such issues cannot be assessed by the drug regulators as use in wet-AMD is unlicensed . Confusion, stemming from differences in trial design, is compounded by the desire of competing manufacturers to create differentiation between biosimilars of the same drug . With the originator cancer drugs, claims of superiority were based on differences in trial outcomes, such as a longer time without tumor or disease progression, higher 5-year overall survival rates, or lower drug toxicity . Since phase III clinial trials for biosimilars are tailored for each drug, and trial endpoints may be different from the originator pivotal study, it may be impossible to directly compare a biosimilar with the originator, or indeed, other biosimilars . Different clinical trial designs therefore offer an opportunity for drug manufacturers to make claims of superiority of one trial approach over another that are of no interest to the regulator . The problem, suggests Professor Pekka Kurki of the Finnish Medicines Agency, is that while regulators decide what constitutes a biosimilar based on analytical and non-clinical testing, as well as clinical trial data (the totality of evidence), clinicians consider only clinical testing .","The next wave of biosimilars will be therapeutic oncology drugs, such as rituximab, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, and recombinant insulins. The equivalence of oncology biosimilars will be based on surrogate pharmacodynamic endpoints, rather than survival, and extrapolation from non-oncology indications, with regulators considering the totality of evidence. Marketing pressure to differentiate between medicines is usually based on clinical differences in phase III trials. However, biosimilars do not fit this commercial model, as by definition, they offer no difference in efficacy or safety with which to differentiate brands."
9781912776238,ch4,"Original reference medicines are protected at launch by patent law and laws on data exclusivity that prevent potential generic and biosimilar drug developers from relying on the originator's test data submitted for marketing approval when seeking such approval for its own product . The manufacturers of original reference drugs are frequently accused of 'evergreening' to delay competition - maintaining data exclusivity through the introduction of minor changes to a product, such as a change to the dosing schedule from twice to once a day, which can potentially extend monopolies for years . This has particularly affected biosimilar development in the USA, where originators have tried to protect monopoly status well beyond the patent expiry of the drug itself through the creation of a 'patent thicket' of often dozens of secondary legal blocks to competitors . The first appearance of such tactics in biosimilar development was in 2015, when an originator biologic manufacturer described publicly its strategy: it listed 22 patents for various diseases or methods of treatment, 14 on the drug's formulation, 24 on its manufacturing practices and 15 other patents . The impact was to prolong US monopoly patent protection up to 2034 - while biosimilar versions of the same drug were approved and marketed in Europe by 2018 . Biosimilar manufacturers have reacted in two ways: some companies have agreed with the reference drug maker to extend US patent protection until 2023, while one company is launching a legal attack on this policy . Patent law is not the only difference affecting biosimilar development in Europe and the USA . Without the regulatory description of 'biosimilar', the US versions of these drugs did not attract the negative position statements of clinician associations that were seen in Europe, nor was there a required understanding of this process at the time . Further biosimilar approvals then stalled until new legislation was passed to create a separate biosimilars approval pathway under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act . However, it also stipulated extending data exclusivity for original reference drugs to 12 years and creating controversial disclosure requirements on biosimilar makers . However, the US regulator in 2010 signaled an intention to further designate some biosimilars 'interchangeable biosimilars'; this subclass has regulatory approval for potential brand substitution by dispensing pharmacists . Similar rulings were placed in the era when generic medicines were being introduced, and one of the key historic roles of pharmaceutical benefit schemes in the USA was to overturn many local state restrictions to create today's competitive American medicines market . Europe has a specific legal problem, with one central regulator shared between 31 nations . Biosimilars are approved by the supranational European Medicines Agency, while patent laws can be national . This explains the European need for 'bioidentical' drug brands for different nations - identical medicines sold under different brand names with different approved indications (some examples are listed in Table 4.1) . No such need for bioidentical medicines is required in the USA as one patent office and one regulator covers the same territory .","'Evergreening' is a process by which manufacturers of originator products introduce minor changes to protect their drug development data from being made available to other companies. US state laws govern drug substitutions by the pharmacist. In Europe, national patent laws may mean that one biosimilar, approved by the European Medicines Agency, is available with different names in different European countries - these are bioidenticals."
9781910797853,chp4,"However, many types of leukemia show no obvious symptoms early in disease, and may be diagnosed incidentally during a physical examination or as a result of a routine blood test . The precise disease classification may rely upon evaluation of abnormal circulating cells (exempli gratia the presence of Auer rods in the blasts of patients with AML - see page 55) . Acute myeloid leukemia is diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy using morphological, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic/molecular analysis . These myeloblasts must account for at least 20% of the total cellularity of the bone marrow biopsy sample; exceptions include leukemias with certain genetic abnormalities and myeloid sarcoma, which are considered diagnostic of AML, regardless of blast count . While CML is definitively diagnosed by the presence of the chromosome translocation t(9;22), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome (see below), examination of the peripheral blood and bone marrow helps to characterize the patient's disease phase (chronic stable phase, accelerated phase or blast phase) . The bone marrow smear in patients with CLL and its variant B-PLL is hypercellular with monotonous areas of small round cells containing a thin rim of cytoplasm . Large granular lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by infiltration of peripheral blood and bone marrow by LGLs with T-cell or NK-cell lineage . The diagnosis can usually be made based on a morphological and immunophenotypic analysis of the peripheral blood, which demonstrates increased numbers of clonal LGLs of T-cell lineage . Morphologically and clinically distinct subsets of leukemia are associated with specific chromosome abnormalities, which also provide important prognostic information . Given the ease with which blood and bone marrow samples can be obtained, there is now a lot of information available about the association between cytogenetic abnormalities and the pathogenesis and natural history of the leukemias, more so than for any other malignancies . The detection of specific chromosome translocations/gene fusions enables a precise diagnosis of leukemia, while the detection of recurring gene mutations in AML and ALL provides important genetic information regarding prognosis and informs the selection of targeted therapies . Thus, in the clinical setting, complete cytogenetic analysis, performed at the time of diagnosis, can be used to identify the chromosome abnormalities in the malignant cells of a particular patient . PCR can detect abnormalities in bone marrow or blood samples at a level of 1 in 10 to 1 in 10 normal cells . Cytogenetic analysis of metaphase cells is a key component of the evaluation of all patients with newly diagnosed or suspected AML . Patients with this abnormality have a poor response to standard therapy, which may be a result of the lesion itself or its association with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), which is also known to convey a poor prognosis (see page 65) . Extramedullary disease can present without bone marrow involvement, and is associated with certain cytogenetic changes such as the t(8;21) chromosome translocation . Acute lymphoblastic leukemia presents with similar symptoms of bone marrow failure as those described for AML above .","Diagnosis of leukemia is based on an integration of clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic and genetic findings. Many types of leukemia, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), show no specific symptoms in the early stages and may be diagnosed incidentally during a physical examination or routine blood test. Both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can present with signs and symptoms of bone marrow failure, including those related to anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The presence of blasts in a peripheral blood smear suggests an underlying hematologic disorder. Myeloblasts containing Auer rods are pathognomonic for AML. Examination of bone marrow aspirate can confirm the diagnosis of leukemia. Flow cytometry can differentiate between ALL and AML on the basis of different cell surface markers. On immunophenotypic analysis, the presence of B-cell antigens in the absence of T-cell antigens differentiates B-cell ALL from T-cell ALL. CML is diagnosed by the presence of the chromosome translocation t(9;22), also known as the Philadelphia chromosome. The t(9;22) mutation also occurs in some cases of ALL. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with favorable responses to treatment, while others are associated with treatment failure. Detection of recurring gene mutations in AML and ALL provides important genetic information about prognosis and informs the selection of targeted therapies."
9781910797006,ch07,"The treatment strategy for stable COPD recommended by the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) considers patient symptoms and future risk of exacerbations (see Figure 3.2; Table 7.2) . Usually, improvements in physiological function can benefit the patient only if the bronchodilator treatment is used together with an aggressive rehabilitation program (see pages 113 -) . Formoterol and salmeterol have been shown to significantly improve FEV, lung volumes and health-related quality of life, and reduce breathlessness and exacerbation rates and frequency . As a result, improved bronchodilation and clinical effect can often be achieved with increased doses, and routine administration of 3 or 4 puffs has been suggested and is widely used . Interestingly, while the bronchodilator effect of ipratropium bromide is clearly shorter than that of salmeterol, both drugs result in a similar degree of improvement in exercise performance 6 hours after administration . While some studies have suggested that a maximal bronchodilator effect can be achieved with a single agent given at sufficiently high dose, several large clinical trials have demonstrated an improvement in bronchodilator effect when a combination of beta-agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators are administered . LABAs and both long- and short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators have been associated with a reduction in the frequency of COPD exacerbations . Inhaled glucocorticosteroids should therefore be considered for patients with more severe airflow limitation (FEV < 60% predicted) who experience frequent exacerbations, particularly if they are already receiving maximal bronchodilator therapy . The combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA is more effective than the individual components at improving lung function and health status and reducing exacerbations in patients with moderate to very severe COPD . The addition of a LABA/inhaled corticosteroid combination to tiotropium has been shown to improve lung function and quality of life and may further reduce exacerbations . The mucolytic and antioxidant drugs N -acetylcysteine and carbocisteine have been shown to reduce the frequency of exacerbations of COPD in patients not taking inhaled corticosteroids . Significant treatment benefits were a reduction in exacerbations, improvement in health status and a reduction in the rate of decline in lung function of 13-16 mL/year . The reductions in exacerbations and improved health status clearly demonstrated in these two large clinical trials support the aggressive treatment of patients with COPD . At all stages of COPD, patients appear to benefit from exercise training programs, which improve exercise tolerance and reduce symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue . A study evaluating the benefits of long-term oxygen for patients with COPD who are not hypoxic at rest but who desaturate with exercise is under way . Given the conflicting evidence for the use of long-term NIPPV, it cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of patients with chronic respiratory failure due to COPD . Studies have shown that very severely affected patients with homogeneous disease and an FEV or DLco less than 20% of the predicted value do not benefit; indeed, there is increased mortality in this group . In patients with very advanced COPD, lung transplantation has been shown to improve health status and functional capacity, though it does not convey a survival benefit .","Bronchodilators are the first-line treatment in COPD; they can be effectively used concurrently and also have beneficial non-bronchodilator effects. Inhaled glucocorticosteroids can improve airflow modestly and can reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations. Short courses (7-14 days) of systemic corticosteroids may help following exacerbations, but should not be used over the long term. Optimum clinical benefits require an integrated program combining pulmonary rehabilitation with pharmacotherapy. Influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with COPD; there is also some evidence to support pneumococcal vaccination. Surgical removal of large bullae and lung volume reduction surgery may improve lung function and symptoms in carefully selected patients. Lung transplantation in patients with very advanced COPD improves health status and functional capacity, though it does not convey a survival benefit. Rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in terms of improving exercise tolerance, symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue in patients with COPD."
9781910797082,ch01,"Psoriasis is a common chronic, disfiguring inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 3% of the population . Two types of chronic plaque psoriasis have been described, based on age of onset, association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and disease course . Furthermore, there is increasing evidence of an association between psoriasis and important comorbidities including cardiovascular and psychiatric disease; evidence suggests that patients with moderate and severe disease have a high mortality due to cardiovascular events (see Chapter 2) . In the UK, although most patients with psoriasis have relatively mild disease, evidence suggests that 30% require second-line treatment (phototherapy or systemic medication) that involves referral to a dermatologist and that perhaps 40% of all dermatology inpatients have psoriasis . In the USA, where inpatient dermatology care is rarely available, and at many institutions in the UK, specialized psoriasis day centers have evolved for patients with moderate-to-severe disease . changes in the epidermis and dermis, such as excessive growth and failure of proper differentiation and proliferation and dilatation of blood vessels, which lead to the development of the clinical psoriatic plaque . The validity of this statement has been borne out by population and family studies and research in twins, all of which suggest an important genetic component to the disease . Approximately 30% of patients with psoriasis will have a known family history of the disease . There have been a number of key genetic advances in recent years: first, the chromosomal localization (on 6p21.3) of the major psoriasis genetic locus, psoriasis susceptibility 1 (PSORS1), which contributes up to 50% of the genetic risk; and secondly, the discovery of several genes that, while conferring a low genetic risk, point to specific biological pathways for the disease . Intriguingly, these genetic findings indicate a key role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha in disease pathogenesis, thus supporting therapy targeted at TNF . Finally, psoriasis responds rapidly to treatments designed to inhibit T-lymphocyte function, such as ciclosporin (cyclosporine), as well as to specific biological agents targeting key cytokines (IL17, TNFalpha, etc . As a result, specific patterns of T-cell differentiation and activation occur, including Th1- and Th17-related molecules, leading to stimulation of keratinocyte hyperproliferation (see below), further cytokine production (particularly TNFalpha) and an influx of neutrophils that result in psoriatic lesion formation (see Figure 1.1) . They are also of considerable clinical importance, as the majority of recently developed drugs, as well as those used in clinical research studies, are targeted specifically at modulating lymphocyte activity in skin (immunotherapy) . Psoriasis represents an important and key disease in which translational medicine has led to major clinical advances . These cells - neutrophils and T lymphocytes in particular - accumulate in both the dermal and epidermal layers of the skin . Which of the factors described above represents the primary pathophysiological event has been debated for more than 100 years . Most evidence indicates that lymphocytes play a key role in the disease process, and that the epidermal proliferation and loss of differentiation are secondary and a consequence of the release of mediators from infiltrating lymphocytes .","Psoriasis affects up to 3% of the population; however, there is considerable interracial variation in prevalence. The usual age of onset is 20-35 years. A family history of psoriasis is found in approximately 30% of patients. Evidence indicates that psoriasis is primarily an immunologic T-cell-driven disease requiring participation of both innate and T-cell-mediated mechanisms. Important environmental triggers include infection, drugs, and physical and psychological stress. Three key events characterize the pathophysiology of psoriasis: epidermal hyperproliferation, angiogenesis and accumulation of inflammatory cells. The impact of psoriasis on the patient's quality of life is similar - physically and emotionally - to that of ischemic heart disease, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

Psychosis has been reported as the single most important precipitant for nursing home placement,, with a consequent increase in mortality . In one study of 11 subjects placed in nursing homes, all died within a 2-year follow-up period . Although other studies have not confirmed this high mortality rate, follow up of 59 subjects 3 years after they had enrolled in the first double-blind trial of clozapine for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) found that 42% of survivors were in nursing homes . In total, 25% of the subjects (15) had died, 6 of whom had died within a few months of completing the trial; none of the deaths was thought to be related to adverse drug effects . Although all patients were treated at some point with clozapine, 37 of the 54 survivors continued to have psychotic symptoms beyond the first few months . Forty patients continued to be treated with antipsychotics, 23 on clozapine . No long-term follow up or short-term mortality was reported in the almost identical trial of clozapine that was performed in France . Studies of American healthcare costs have underscored the increased cost associated with PDP . A recent study reported that patients with PDP had yearly costs over twice as high as patients with PD but no psychosis, as well as an increased risk of falls (3 times higher) and twice the risk of fractures . In addition, the patients with PDP stayed an average of 179 days, compared to 83 days for the non-psychotic patients and 22 days for the controls . The cost difference was $31 178 per year (PDP) versus $14 461 (non-psychotic) . A UK study of 7271 patients with PD (1994-2013) found that those with the disease required $3716 more for healthcare per year than age-matched controls without PD . In addition, patients with PD with greater disability, including psychosis, required an additional $1608 per year . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that the deaths of patients receiving pimavanserin were likely to be due to underlying disease rather than drug effects . However, pimavanserin, like all other antipsychotic drugs, carries a black box warning of increased mortality . The warning for pimavanserin was purely derivative, based on data showing increased risk of death with antipsychotics, and did not take drug pharmacology into consideration . A 2-year chart review comparing mortality in 113 patients with PDP treated with pimavanserin with 505 who received quetiapine and 58 treated with both, found non-significant trends of increased mortality of 7.1%, 11.5% and 12.1%, respectively . The increased mortality associated with the use of antipsychotic drugs must be considered when making treatment plans . While the FDA has requested that attempts be made to lower or discontinue antipsychotic use whenever possible, and American nursing homes are graded on their reduction of antipsychotic drug use, this should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time .","Psychotic symptoms have been shown to be the single most important cause of nursing home placement in patients with PD. Healthcare costs have been found to be twice as high for patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) than for those without psychosis. Acute psychosis may require hospitalization. Causes for hospitalization include direct safety issues, both for the patient and their family. All antipsychotics carry a black box warning of increased mortality, which should be considered when making treatment plans. Although the FDA generally recommends that attempts be made to lower or discontinue antipsychotic use whenever possible, this should not apply to patients with PDP, whose psychotic symptoms generally worsen with time."
9781908541901,ch_3,"NSTEMI results from a partial (or a transient but complete) coronary occlusion and distal embolization of platelet-fibrin thrombi, compromising microcirculatory blood flow . STEMI results from a sudden and complete occlusion of an epicardial artery, and these patients have persistent (> 20 minutes) ST-segment elevation, indicative of transmural ischemia . Pathological and imaging observations indicate that the common underlying mechanism of ACS is atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion followed by superimposed thrombosis formation and distal embolization . Activated platelets serve as inflammatory mediators by expressing various membrane receptors capable of interacting with leukocytes and endothelial cells and thereby significantly contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis (Figures 1.3 and 1.4) . A vulnerable plaque is prone to rupture or erosion, leading to platelet-rich thrombosis generation and subsequently to ACS . Histologically, a vulnerable plaque consists of a thin-capped fibroatheroma that is enriched in cholesterol debris, a large number of inflammatory cells - especially macrophages, some activated T cells, and smooth muscle cells . Large amounts of hyaluronan (an anionic non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan that is present in both eroded and ruptured plaques) promote thrombosis by enhancing local adherence of platelets and leukocytes . The underlying mechanisms of vulnerable plaque development (fibrous cap thinning and propensity to rupture) and thrombus generation at the site of plaque rupture are poorly understood . Microemboli of plaque material and thrombus may be washed downstream from the culprit lesion leading to distal microembolization, whereas iatrogenic embolization may occur during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) . In addition to thrombus generation at the culprit plaque rupture site, multiple plaque ruptures and luminal thrombi may occur in ACS patients . Moreover, the risk of new thrombus generation at the site of a non-culprit lesion is high during the 12 months after initial presentation in ACS patients . Non-culprit lesions that were responsible for unanticipated subsequent thrombotic events were angiographically mild at the baseline and characterized by thin-cap fibroatheroma, large plaque burden (>= 70%) or small luminal area (<= 4 mm) . Moreover, only occasionally (1%) a major life-threatening thrombus or acute coronary event develops at the site of a plaque rupture (Figure 1.6) . Atherosclerotic plaque rupture and endothelial denudation result in the exposure of the subendothelial matrix and the release of various factors such as cholesterol, tissue factor and necrotic debris . Binding of activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors via fibrinogen molecules between adjacent platelets results in stable and robust thrombus generation at the site of vessel wall injury . Plaque rupture also results in tissue factor exposure at the site of vascular injury and the generation of small amounts of thrombin, the most potent primary platelet agonist . In addition to the prothrombotic properties resulting from heightened platelet reactivity, a procoagulant and antifibrinolytic environment in the presence of a dysfunctional endothelium and plaque rupture markedly enhances clot formation and stability . The clinical manifestation of thrombus generation at the site of plaque rupture depends on the extent and duration of thrombotic occlusion . STEMI is often characterized by the complete obstruction of coronary vessels by 'red thrombi' rich in red blood cells and fibrin that overlay platelet-rich thrombi (see Figure 1.1) .","The common underlying mechanism of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion, with differing degrees of superimposed thrombosis and distal embolization. Although atherosclerosis starts with the development of dysfunctional endothelium in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors early in life, the speed of progression is non-linear, unpredictable and varies markedly between individuals. A vulnerable plaque is prone to rupture or erosion and consists of a thin-capped fibroatheroma that is enriched in cholesterol debris, a large number of inflammatory cells (especially macrophages, some activated T cells), and smooth muscle cells. The major determinants of thrombus generation are those of the classic 'triad of Virchow': thrombogenicity of the exposed plaque material (plaque vulnerability), local flow disturbances (vessel vulnerability), and systemic thrombotic propensity (blood vulnerability). Mural platelet-rich 'white' thrombi most often incompletely block coronary blood flow and are present in unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) is often characterized by the complete obstruction of coronary vessels by thrombi rich in red blood cells and fibrin, which overlay platelet-rich thrombi."
9781910797693,chp1,"They range in size and structural complexity from simple proteins such as insulin and growth hormone to complex molecules such as coagulation factors and monoclonal antibodies, as shown in Figure 1.1 . The complex nature of the biologics, and their manufacturing processes, means that identical copies of these molecule cannot be created . As with all biologic medicines, the challenge for manufacturers and regulators is to ensure that copies of biologics are close enough in structure and function to the reference product to have no clinically meaningful differences in practical use . Molecules made in living systems have inherent variability, even between batches of the same product, which is known as microheterogeneity . The manufacturing process can affect important aspects of the structure of a biological drug; a copied biologic can therefore never be entirely identical to the original reference product . Thus, the active substance of a biosimilar and its reference medicine is almost the same biological substance but there may be minor differences as a result of their complex nature and production methods . Like the reference (originator) biologic, the biosimilar has a degree of natural variability . When a biosimilar is approved, this variability, and any differences between the biosimilar and the reference biologic, will have been shown not to affect safety or effectiveness . In addition, manufacturing processes change frequently over the life of a biologic, adding to the potential for variability . A 2016 study of all European-approved originator monoclonal antibodies identified a mean of 11 changes with moderate or high potential risk per drug . Changes in manufacturing risks the introduction of more significant variation in the tertiary structure of a biologic, known as 'step changes' (see Figure 1.3) . One example, a step change resulting from a new process in the manufacture of darbepoetin-alfa required confirmation through additional phase I, II and III studies . Bioidenticals are products that are the same but have different brand names (as can also occur with small molecule drugs); some examples of bioidenticals are provided in Table 1.2 . Different brand names may also be used for a biosimilar of a reference product that still has patent protection for some indications, particularly in Europe where the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approves medicines for use in more than 30 countries . Such medicines, while clinically active, may not be close enough to the originator molecule to be judged biosimilar in analytical or clinical testing . For example, in Mexico, 23 intended copy biologics had been registered as generics by 2011, and in Russia, 20 epoetins, 53 interferons, 42 monoclonal antibody drugs, 61 insulins, 11 somatropins, 24 filgrastims and 55 heparin versions had been approved to 2015 . Whilst intended copy biologics are unlikely to be encountered in clinical practice in the EU and USA, it should be borne in mind that such products have been misleadingly identified as biosimilars . Note that intended copy biologics have also been referred to as 'non-comparable biotherapeutic products', 'biomimics' 'bio-generics' and 'bio-questionables' .","Biologics are typically proteins, ranging in size from simple proteins to large, complex monoclonal antibodies. They are created in living systems. Inherent variability exists for all biologics and creates batch-to-batch variability for all products. Biosimilars are highly similar, but not identical, to their reference (originator) biologic. Furthermore, biologics themselves show inherent variation between batches (microheterogeneity), such that no batch is identical to previous batches. The slight differences between batches of biologics, or between biologics and biosimilars, are authorised and not expected to have any meaningful effect on clinical use. Changes to manufacturing processes can introduce significant changes to the tertiary structure of a biologic; analytics tests (and, exceptionally, new clinical trials) are required to assure that safety and efficacy have not changed."
9781910797310,chp6,"In randomized controlled trials of patients with advanced disease and good PS, cisplatin-based chemotherapy has shown a significant improvement over best supportive care (BSC) in terms of disease progression, survival and palliation of disease-related symptoms . Furthermore, a meta-analysis of randomized trials observed that a two-drug regimen significantly increased tumor response (OR 0.42, CI 95% 0.37-0.47, p <0.001) and 1-year survival (OR 0.80, CI 95% 0.70-0.91, p <0.001) compared with single-agent treatment, although there was a significant increase in adverse events . Two randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), added to standard first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy . Both trials showed benefit in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who received the antiangiogenic therapy, but a significant difference in overall survival (OS) was only seen in those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (12.3 vs 10.3 months; HR: 0.79 p =0.003 favoring bevacizumab) . Two phase III trials have evaluated the addition of necitumumab, a recombinant antibody targeting EGFR, to a two-drug platinum combination in patients with squamous and non-squamous lung cancer . The survival benefit in fit, elderly patients with NSCLC receiving platinum-based combination treatment appears to be similar to that seen in younger patients . A survival benefit was demonstrated in patients aged 70-89 years who received a weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel combination compared with a single-agent regimen, despite an increased but manageable toxicity profile . Non-platinum-based combinations have not demonstrated a survival benefit over single agents in this population . Some series and prospective trials have shown survival benefit and improved symptom control with combinations compared with single agents in the elderly with PS2, although the benefit was much lower than that seen in patients with PS 0-1 . However, these studies were done before the use of well-tolerated drugs like pemetrexed, which has now been evaluated as both a first-line combination therapy and a maintenance single agent . Continuous maintenance with pemetrexed has demonstrated statistical improvement in OS in patients with NSCLC compared with placebo (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.96, p =0.0195; median OS 13.9 vs 11 months) . Switch maintenance with pemetrexed after non-progression following a non-pemetrexed combination regimen, has also shown a benefit in terms of PFS and OS in one randomized trial . Two chemotherapy drugs are currently approved for second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC: docetaxel and pemetrexed . In 1999, a significant survival benefit (37% vs 11%) and improvement in disease-related symptoms was demonstrated with second-line docetaxel compared with BSC in patients with advanced NSCLC and good PS who had relapsed following a first-line platinum-based treatment . Several randomized studies have been performed in patients with NSCLC comparing second-line docetaxel-based combination chemotherapy with docetaxel single agent: no significant differences in response rate, median survival or PFS were reported . In two randomized phase II trials, pemetrexed-based combination therapy produced a higher response rate than the single agent but showed no benefit in terms of survival . Second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy combined with a targeted agent has also shown promising results .","Treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC without an actional somatic gene mutation consists of systemic chemotherapy; regimen selection is based on histology, comorbidities and performance status (PS). Platinum-based combinations are the backbone of first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC. Pemetrexed regimens are restricted to non-squamous histology. Pemetrexed as continuous or switch maintenance prolongs survival over no maintenance in patients with non-squamous histologies and PS 0,1. Bevacizumab combined with a paclitaxel regimen can provide a survival benefit over a paclitaxel regimen alone in patients with non-squamous subgroups. Advanced age alone should not preclude appropriate NSCLC treatment. Two chemotherapy drugs have been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC in the second-line setting: docetaxel and pemetrexed. Platinum re-challenge could represent a potential option for fit, relapsed patients with a platinum-free interval treatment of more than 6 months."
9781912776696,hh-7,"Suppose several different endpoints are being assessed; for example, objective response (partial response [PR] or complete response [CR]), clinical benefit (stable disease [SD], PR or CR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) . A general approach to control the type I error (alpha = 0.05) would be to divide it across the endpoints that are being considered . Paying a price on the alpha in this way and using a reduced significance level enables researchers to draw confirmatory conclusions for the endpoints that are significant . For example, in a study of patients with advanced prostate cancer, researchers may want the flexibility to draw confirmatory conclusions for both PFS and OS as co-primary endpoints . The Bonferroni correction would divide the 0.05 by 2 and assign a significance level of 0.025 to each endpoint . However, PFS is potentially the easier endpoint in terms of achieving statistical significance, possibly because there is likely to be a larger treatment effect on that endpoint or because, by definition, there will be more PFS events than OS events . The Bonferroni correction is not the only approach to splitting the alpha; the Hochberg method is also in fairly common use . Suppose the p -values for three different endpoints have been calculated and ordered from largest to smallest . If that p -value is <= 0.025 (0.05/2) then that endpoint and the endpoint with the smallest p -value are statistically significant (Case 2 in Example 4.1) . If that p -value is <= 0.017 (0.05/3) then that endpoint is statistically significant (Case 3 in Example 4.1) . Note that if the Bonferroni correction is applied to Example 4.1, with an adjusted significance level of 0.017 for all three endpoints, the only statistically significant endpoint would be E in cases 2 and 3 . In the approaches to multiple testing discussed above, paying a price on the alpha gives researchers the flexibility to cherry-pick significant p -values at a lower significance level . The endpoints are then tested in that order using 0.05 as the significance level, but the statistical significance can only be claimed down to the first non-significant result . For example, the primary endpoint may be placed at the top of several endpoints for hierarchical testing, with three key secondary endpoints placed together in position 2 to be tested with a Bonferroni or possibly a Hochberg correction . It is not uncommon for a study to show an impressive treatment difference in a key subgroup but fail in terms of the primary endpoint . If there is a treatment difference in favor of the experimental treatment, it is routine practice to produce a forest plot that displays the result overall and in subgroups (Figure 4.1) . If all of the point estimates (the hazard ratios shown in Figure 4.1) fall within the confidence interval (CI) for the overall treatment effect, then there is no evidence for heterogeneity . In Figure 4.1 the treatment effect in the subgroup of patients under 65 years in isolation is non-significant .","As several simultaneous statistical tests are usually conducted (exempli gratia for several different endpoints or time points, for the overall sample and several subgroups), the potential for a significant p -value to occur purely by chance increases. The overall type I error rate, known as the family-wise error rate must be controlled in every trial at 5%. The Bonferroni correction divides the 0.05 equally across all endpoints; for example, for four endpoints, the significance level for each endpoint would be 0.05/4 = 0.0125. The decision to do this must be made in the study protocol. The Hochberg approach places the p -values in order, from largest to smallest, and then assigns a different significance level to each; for example, <= 0.05 to the largest, <= 0.025 (0.05/2) to the next and 0.017 (0.05/3) to the next, and so on. In hierarchical testing (or closed testing), the endpoints of interest are ranked from most important to least important before the study begins. The endpoints are then tested in that order using 0.05 as the significance level. The statistical significance can only be claimed down to the first non-significant result. Attention should not be refocused on strong subgroup results because of the problem of multiplicity. If there is a good clinical argument that supports a strong effect in a subgroup, then that subgroup should be built into the confirmatory testing strategy from the beginning of the study. Forest plots are a good way of graphically displaying the results of subgroup analyses."
9781910797273,chp4,"Corticosteroid therapy is therefore reserved either for patients with disabling relapses or for those with an occupational (or other) need to recover function faster than the natural history of the condition allows . Studies showing an improvement in patient-reported outcomes after steroid treatment may also contribute to the decision to prescribe these agents in order to help lessen symptomatology and improve quality of life . However, evidence supporting the use of oral prednisolone/prednisone is limited and there is no indication for prolonged oral steroid therapy following MS relapse . The results of the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial indicate that administration of moderate-dose oral prednisone, 60 mg/day, to patients with acute optic neuritis actually increases the risk of recurrence . For this reason, high-dose oral or intravenous methylprednisolone is the preferred treatment choice for acute relapse . There are times when patients cannot tolerate intravenous or oral steroids, or second therapy is necessary for more severe relapses . In a proportion of patients with MS, nabiximols, which contain δ-9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) at a 1:1 fixed ratio, has been shown to improve self-reported spasticity scores, sleep disruption and the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index when added to baseline stable therapies such as baclofen or tizanidine . Botulinum toxin type A is a useful therapy for patients with severe focal spasticity . Patients receiving high levels of oral antispasticity medications may feel that a continuous infusion is preferable to multiple tablets, especially if swallowing has been affected or if systemic side effects are unacceptable . Fatigue is a common symptom during relapse, but may follow a course independent of clinical and imaging markers of disease activity . Usually, the patient is taught this technique, but physical issues such as poor upper limb function (strength or coordination) or significant lower limb spasticity (adductor spasms) may prevent this approach . Patients with symptomatic detrusor activity and post-voiding residual urinary volumes of less than 100 mL are initially treated with bladder antispasmodics, including . Multidisciplinary management with pain specialists who use non-pharmacological techniques can be very helpful . Physical therapy/rehabilitation can improve muscle weakness, spasticity and general wellbeing, particularly in the context of deconditioning associated with relapses or intercurrent illness . Responders (fewer than half of patients in clinical trials) taking a dose of 10 mg twice daily can be identified within the first 4 weeks of treatment; walking speed, as determined by a 25-foot timed walk, improves by an average of 25% in this group . Fampridine is generally well tolerated but side effects can include neuropathic pain, vertigo and, rarely, seizures . Both seizures and paroxysmal symptoms may respond rapidly to anticonvulsant therapy, but a diagnosis of epilepsy can have profound effects on the social/employment status of the patient . A concurrent mood disorder may have a profound effect on both physical and cognitive functioning in patients with MS and must be sought and treated aggressively with a program of behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy and physical exercise .","Disabling multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses should be treated with high-dose (500-1000 mg/day) short-course (3-5 days) intravenous or oral methylprednisolone. Corticosteroid therapy hastens recovery from acute relapse but may not affect ultimate function. There is no indication for prolonged oral steroid therapy following MS relapse. Moderate dose (60 mg/day) oral corticosteroid therapy for optic neuritis may increase the risk of recurrence and should be avoided. MS symptoms including pain, spasticity and sphincter dysfunction are a source of significant disability and should be treated proactively. Spasticity may be severe and is managed in most patients with a combination of physical therapy and oral medication. In severe focal spasticity, botulinum toxin injections have a role. Bladder dysfunction commonly manifests with urinary frequency, urgency and urge incontinence and is ameliorated with anticholinergic therapy in most patients with low urinary residual volumes (< 100 mL). Intermittent self-catheterization should be considered in patients with significant urinary retention (urinary residual volume > 100 mL), and formal urodynamic studies may be indicated to exclude complex bladder dysfunction. Pain in MS most commonly has a neuropathic origin and responds to anticonvulsant therapy or antidepressant (tricyclic or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) therapy. Impaired mobility is a dominant feature of progressive MS, and function should be optimized through multidisciplinary care, provision of appropriate walking aids and, in selected cases, symptomatic treatment with fampridine. Depression complicates the course of MS in up to 40% of patients and should be proactively managed with a program of physical exercise, behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy as indicated."
9781908541680,ch_9,"drugs that affect gastrointestinal neuroendocrine function and gut-brain neural circuitry to alter appetite, satiety and metabolism; some such agents are used in the management of type 2 diabetes and have been shown to produce weight loss; for example, the amylin receptor agonist pramlintide (licensed in the USA) and the glucagon-like peptide [GLP]-1 receptor agonists (exempli gratia liraglutide) . Phentermine/topiramate extended-release capsules are approved in the USA for the treatment of chronic weight management in patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) >= 30 kg/m (obese) or in those with a BMI >= 27 kg/m (overweight) who also have at least one weight-related comorbidity (exempli gratia type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) . Phase III clinical trials such as CONQUER and EQUIP demonstrated approximately 10% weight loss sustained at 2 years accompanied by improvements in metabolic risk factors when used in combination with a diet and lifestyle modification program . It is approved in the USA for the treatment of chronic weight management in patients with an initial BMI >= 30 kg/m, or >= 27 kg/m plus at least one weight-related comorbidity (exempli gratia type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) . 'Bariatric surgery' refers to surgical procedures that lead directly to weight loss, used in the management of obesity and related comorbidities . The surgical treatment of obesity is cost-effective and may be the only means by which certain individuals can lose significant amounts of weight and maintain weight loss long term, accompanied by reversal or significant improvement in comorbidities . Restrictive procedures have the advantages of lower cost, technical ease, low surgical risk and the absence of any long-term malabsorption, but compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) the amount and durability of weight loss are limited and reversal or improvement of complications less frequent; with bands, late complications may be significant and irreversible . It was initially developed as the first part of a two-stage procedure for patients considered too high risk to safely undergo immediate RYGB, but is now performed as a standalone operation because of the excellent weight loss it induces . The aim of allowing patients to eat and drink without dietary restrictions but to still lose weight was successful, but the procedure caused an unacceptable incidence of severe, potentially life-threatening complications and side effects such as acute hepatic failure, cirrhosis, oxalate nephropathy, chronic renal failure, immune complex arthritis and malabsorption syndromes . In an American meta-analysis of major studies the mean excess weight loss was 61.2% for all patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 47.5% for gastric banding, 61.6% for RYGB and 70.1% for BPD or duodenal switch . It was started in 1987 and included over 4000 patients, who either underwent substantial weight loss by bariatric surgery or remained weight stable by conventional non-surgical management . A sleeve gastrectomy is an inappropriate procedure for children and adolescents because it is irreversible, and a band is inappropriate because of the limited weight loss and reversal of comorbidities, high rate of long-term complications including potential for irreversible esophageal dysmotility and gastric scarring .","Pharmacotherapy should only be used as an adjunct to lifestyle modification. Pharmacotherapy is more effective for the maintenance than induction of weight loss but must be used on an ongoing basis to maintain the effect. Pharmacotherapy improves the cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity. Orlistat has been shown to be safe and effective, and to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, over a 4-year period. Bariatric surgery is among the most clinically effective and cost-effective procedures in medicine. The majority of cases of diabetes resolve after bariatric surgery. Adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are performed laparoscopically."
9781912776153,chp1,"The fibrous ring that supports the mitral and tricuspid valves is an electrical insulator, so depolarization can only travel from the atria to the ventricles via the specialized conducting tissues, unless an abnormal electrically active connection, such as an accessory pathway, is present . The mass of ventricular tissue far outweighs that of the atria, hence the amplitude of electrical depolarization of the ventricles (represented by the surface QRS complex) is much greater than that in the atria . This takes the form of progressive lengthening of the PR interval until a single beat is blocked, known as the Wenckebach phenomenon, and is a normal feature of AV nodal conduction at high heart rates (Figure 1.2) . This slowing phenomenon of AV nodal tissue is known as decremental conduction and is characteristic of the AV node (accessory pathways very rarely demonstrate decrementation) . Maneuvers that provoke a vagal response, such as carotid sinus massage or vomiting, may terminate arrhythmias that use the AV node as part of their mechanism (exempli gratia many supraventricular tachycardias; SVTs) . The best-described mechanism of re-entry is that due to an accessory pathway - an abnormal connection between the atria and ventricle that bypasses the specialized conducting tissues of the AV node and His-Purkinje system . These accessory pathways (also known as bypass tracts) are usually anatomically separate from the specialized conducting tissue (Figure 1.3) . A narrow QRS complex during an arrhythmia means that depolarization of the ventricles occurs via the specialized system of the AV node and the His-Purkinje system . Most have narrow QRS complexes on the surface ECG, demonstrating that depolarization of the ventricles occurs over the His-Purkinje system . This allows part of the ventricle to depolarize before it would otherwise do so (overt pre-excitation), resulting in a diagnostic abnormality on the surface ECG - fusion of the P wave with the initial part of the QRS complex, demonstrating depolarization from both normal AV node conduction and through the accessory pathway (Figure 1.4) . Sustained arrhythmia in WPW syndrome requires both an accessory pathway (the substrate) and a trigger, which is almost always an ectopic beat, either atrial or ventricular . A critically timed atrial or ventricular ectopic beat during the tachycardia can also terminate an arrhythmia if the ectopic depolarizes the part of the heart that lies in front of the circulating wavefront, creating an area of refractoriness as the tachycardia wavefront arrives . During sinus rhythm, antegrade conduction causes the surface ECG to be abnormal as described above, indicating the presence of the accessory pathway . Orthodromic tachycardia occurs in 95% of patients with WPW syndrome, with the arrhythmia circuitry exhibiting antegrade conduction through the AV node and His-Purkinje system, and retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway (see Figure 1.5) . During SVT, the QRS complexes are narrow, as ventricular depolarization occurs normally via the His-Purkinje system . Electrophysiology has shown that in some patients with SVTs, the accessory pathway is capable of only retrograde conduction, so pre-excitation of the ventricles from the atrium never occurs .","Cardiac cells have the unique ability to depolarize rhythmically; depolarization normally occurs in one direction from the top down, from atria to ventricles. The fibrous atrioventricular (AV) ring, which supports the mitral and tricuspid valves, behaves as an electrical insulator: conduction to the ventricles occurs only over the AV node, unless there is an abnormal or aberrant connection. The AV node has a decremental slowing effect on conduction. Autonomic effects on the heart (sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli) can significantly influence cardiac conduction. Re-entry is the most frequent mechanism for arrhythmias. The substrate for an arrhythmia is an abnormal electrical pathway or a region of scarred myocardium. The trigger is an atrial or ventricular ectopic beat. Narrow QRS complex arrhythmias signify depolarization of the ventricle over the usual His-Purkinje system. Most supraventricular tachycardias have narrow QRS complexes. Wide- (broad-) complex tachycardias need further investigation, and patients should be referred for urgent assessment. They should be considered ventricular in origin until proven otherwise."
9781908541901,ch_7,"Over the past decade, clinical outcomes for patients with STEMI have improved as a result of increased awareness, speed of diagnosis, and treatment with both reperfusion and adjuvant medical therapy . In 25-30% of patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), initial angiography shows a patent infarct-related artery . It is recommended that early reperfusion (preferably primary PCI) should be performed within 12 hours of symptom onset in patients with the clinical presentation of STEMI (Figure 5.3) and for those with persistent ST-segment elevation or new or presumed new LBBB . Although previously it was suggested that rapid coronary artery thrombus aspiration in STEMI patients during catheterization may improve blood flow and restore ST-segment elevation, routine thrombus ASA (aspirin) before PCI, as compared with PCI alone, was not associated with reduced 30-day mortality among patients with STEMI in the recently published open-label TASTE trial . Worse clinical outcomes have been observed in both randomized studies and registries when long delays have occurred before the primary PCI, id est increased time from symptom onset to first medical contact (FMC − ECG-confirmed diagnosis of STEMI), time from FMC to arrival in the cath laboratory, time from FMC to sheath insertion, and time from FMC to balloon inflation . A recent meta-analysis showed that rescue PCI is associated with a significant reduction in heart failure and reinfarction and a trend towards lower all-cause mortality when compared with a conservative strategy, but with an increased risk of stroke and bleeding complications . Rescue PCI should be considered when there is evidence of failed fibrinolysis based on clinical signs and insufficient ST-segment resolution (< 50%), if there is clinical or ECG evidence of a large infarct, and if the procedure can be performed within a reasonable time period (up to 12 hours after the onset of symptoms) . If rescue PCI is not available, there is a large infarct and the risk of bleeding is not high, a second administration of a non-immunogenic fibrinolytic agent (see above) may be considered, although readministration of a fibrinolytic agent has not been shown to be superior to conservative therapy . A resolution of more than 50% of ST-segment elevation 60-90 minutes after the initiation of therapy is considered a good indicator of improved myocardial perfusion and is associated with enhanced recovery of LV function, reduced infarct size and improved prognosis . Abciximab is the GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor most extensively studied in acute STEMI patients referred for primary PCI (used as a 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by infusion of 0.125 μg/kg/min up to a maximum of 10 μg/min for 12 hours) in combination with unfractionated heparin (UH) . In the HORIZONS-AMI trial, bivalirudin therapy alone was associated with significantly reduced 30-day and 3-year rates of major bleeding and a reduction in net adverse clinical events compared with heparin plus GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI . Fondaparinux is not recommended at all in primary PCI for acute STEMI patients because of concerns for catheter-related thrombus and interventional complications .","Immediate recognition of STEMI with timely initiation of reperfusion therapies is associated with improved outcomes. The selection of reperfusion strategy in STEMI (pharmacological versus invasive) is critically dependent on the time from onset of symptoms, mortality risk of STEMI and bleeding risk. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred choice of revascularization in STEMI patients if it can be offered within 90-120 minutes of diagnosis. Prasugrel and ticagrelor have superseded clopidogrel as the gold standard in dual antiplatelet therapy. In the European guidelines, bivalirudin is the anticoagulant of choice during primary PCI, while enoxaparin has its merits as an adjuvant to thrombolytic therapy. Whereas, in the US guidelines there is no general preference for bivalirudin over unfractionated heparin and there is no recommendation for enoxaparin."
9781912776139,ch2,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is thought to occur in all regions of the world, but the epidemiology is based on data from the most socioeconomically developed countries, plus the study of atypical cases from geographically isolated populations, notably Guam, the Japanese Kii peninsula and West Papua, Indonesia . In common with other neurodegenerative disorders, age is the leading risk factor for the development of ALS . True population-based data are scarce, but the mean age of onset in Western hemisphere studies is approximately 65 years for men and 67 years for women . A plot of log age of symptom onset versus log incidence supports a 'multiple-hit' mathematical model in which ALS occurs as a result of a range of perturbations over a lifetime . An extreme example of this is mutation in the FUS gene, which is linked to an often aggressive, typically lower motor neuron (LMN)-predominant form of ALS with symptom onset in the teenage years . For many of the genes linked to familial ALS, a broad range of clinical phenotypes (exempli gratia spinal versus bulbar onset) is still found in affected members of the same pedigree . In 97% of all cases of ALS, regardless of whether a genetic cause is identified or not, neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions of aggregated transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43) are identified post mortem (see page 21) . Geographically isolated populations are an attractive source of data for understanding core disease mechanisms and the interplay of environmental and genetic factors, but have demonstrated limited mechanisms of relevance to sporadic ALS thus far . Several studies have shown increased leisure time and occupational physical activity to be risk factors . ALS is associated with a range of cellular and metabolic derangements (Figure 2.2), and researchers continue to search for the basis of the highly selective vulnerability of motor neurons . The discovery of the predominantly RNA-binding protein TDP-43 as the cellular signature of nearly all cases of ALS was supported by the identification of mutations in the TARDBP gene, albeit in very rare cases of familial ALS . However, further support for the concept of deranged RNA processing underlying ALS was provided by the discovery of another rare cause of familial ALS, namely mutations in another RNA-binding gene, FUS . It was the identification, in 2011, of an intronic GGGGCC HRE in C9orf72 as the cause of at least one-third of all familial ALS cases (and 10% of all ALS cases) that brought particular emphasis to the study of RNA biology (see page 26) . Short-interval paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have demonstrated consistently increased excitability of the cortex in ALS, and at least some months before the onset of symptoms in carriers of highly penetrant ALS-causing genetic mutations . The discovery, in 1993, of mutations in the SOD1 gene in cases of familial ALS was rapidly followed by the creation of a transgenic mouse model . However, SOD1 mutations account for only 2% of all ALS and lack the core TDP-43 pathology seen in more than 97% of human brains at post mortem .","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is thought to involve a multistep pathogenesis with a variable mixture of predominantly genetic or environmentally mediated factors. Approximately 90% of cases appear to occur sporadically. The lifetime risk of developing ALS increases with age. A sizable body of epidemiological evidence, albeit mostly retrospectively acquired, supports a common clinical perception of premorbid athleticism and lower body mass index in ALS. Multiple and diverse cellular pathways, many involving cells adjacent to the motor neuron, are implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. An intronic hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion in C9orf72 underpins around 10% of all cases of ALS in the Western hemisphere. RNA mishandling is a core theme underlying the aggregated TDP-43 signature that defines the ALS syndrome. Rodent modeling of ALS has been disappointing in terms of human therapeutic translation. Cellular models currently lack the ability to study neuronal network integrity."
9781908541963,chapter3,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world . Alcohol-related liver injury presents a spectrum of disease, including asymptomatic hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), steatosis accompanied by inflammation (steatohepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis), cirrhosis with liver failure, variceal bleeding, ascites and even the development of hepatocellular carcinoma . Patients with alcoholic hepatitis are usually jaundiced and report fatigue, malaise and anorexia . The aminotransferases are elevated and have a characteristic pattern in patients with ALD: the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is almost always higher than the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and the greater the ratio the more likely that the liver disease is due to alcohol . A liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing ALD and in documenting the severity of liver injury, but may not be required in all cases . This is particularly true when the patient's history is suggestive of ALD, there is no evidence of viral hepatitis and biopsy could be difficult (id est patients with coagulopathy or severe ascites) . It is important to rule out other forms of liver disease and to document any concomitant injurious agents . Although most patients who drink alcohol never develop significant liver disease, and many patients with viral hepatitis do well over long periods of time, the combination of viral hepatitis and alcoholism often accelerates the development of advanced liver injury . There is an interesting parallel between ALD and the more recently recognized non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; see Chapter 6), which is usually seen in patients with insulin resistance, obesity or diabetes . Although it seems self-evident, the diagnosis of ALD is made easier if it can be documented that the patient is drinking injurious amounts of alcohol (id est 80 g - about six drinks - per day for men and as little as 20 g per day for women) . The CAGE questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and reports from families may be helpful in identifying patients whose alcohol consumption is excessive (see Table 1.2) . Small amounts of alcohol would not be expected to cause ALD in men and, if it can be confirmed that a patient consumes only a small amount of alcohol, other causes of liver disease must be considered . The treatment of ALD essentially entails abstinence from alcohol, which is clearly the most important factor in promoting both short- and long-term survival . This is particularly important for patients with alcoholic hepatitis . Unfortunately, however, a few patients with advanced liver disease develop hepatic encephalopathy when given large amounts of protein . Most hepatologists believe that patients with the most severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis - id est those with a Maddrey's discriminant function (DF) score greater than 32 - will benefit from a course of corticosteroids . Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been recorded in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and clinical outcome appears to correlate with TNF levels . One study has documented that pentoxifylline improved survival in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, presumably by interfering with TNF .","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease. Early intervention prevents permanent injury, but interrupting alcoholism can be difficult. Patients with ALD typically have mild to moderate elevations in aminotransferases, with AST > ALT. Patients with ALD are often malnourished; improving nutrition is an important treatment goal. Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis may benefit from corticosteroids or pentoxifylline."
9781910797105,ch12,"Early intervention and prevention . First episodes of psychosis can go undetected and untreated for long periods of time . The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is strongly associated with response to treatment and speed to remission in the first episode, although it is still disputed whether this is truly a causal link . Nonetheless, this observation is the main impetus behind the increased focus on early detection and treatment of the first episode of schizophrenia . First, is it possible to detect, and so treat, people earlier in their first episode? Second, if so, will earlier treatment lead to better outcomes? Some of the reasons for delayed detection are given in Table 12.1 . Public education, training of family physicians and youth workers in recognizing early signs, and specialist rapid assessment teams have been shown in pilot early-intervention services to reduce median DUP to 6 weeks, with a concomitant reduction in symptom severity by the time treatment is initiated . Randomized controlled trials of whole services suggest that early detection and intervention improve medium-term outcomes . Only part of the link between long DUP and poor outcome is explained by the fact that a long DUP leads to more severe symptoms by the time treatment is commenced (Table 12.2) . Optimal treatment in the first episode . Key elements of an early intervention strategy are given in Table 12.3 . Short-term outcome from the first episode is good in 85% of cases, with remission usually achieved within 3 months . Patients in the first episode are responsive to relatively low doses of antipsychotic drugs, and treatment should be started with the equivalent of haloperidol, 2 mg daily, or less . Although remission from the first episode is usual, 50% of people relapse within the following 2 years and 80% within the following 5 years . With each relapse, about 1 in 6 will not subsequently achieve remission . . It is possible to identify individuals in the community who are at very high risk of developing schizophrenia in the near future . Table 12.4a summarizes the descriptions of such cases with so-called prodromal or clinical-high-risk symptoms . In DSM-5, these symptoms are listed as a 'condition for further study' (Table 12.4b) . Overall, follow-up studies of individuals seeking help for these symptoms show that a significant proportion develop schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder over the following 12 months . Early follow-up studies of clinical-high-risk cases suggested rates of transition of 40%, although more recent studies suggest that 10-15% is more representative . If effective drug or psychological interventions are given at this prodromal stage, it may be feasible to prevent, delay or at least ameliorate subsequent psychosis in such cases (Case history 12.1) . Randomized trials have shown that second-generation antipsychotic drug treatments reduce rates of transition to schizophrenia and that cognitive therapy may also do so . While this is one of the most promising current research areas, the ethical issues relating to the treatment of individuals, most of whom will not go on to develop psychosis, still need to be fully explored .","Duration of untreated psychosis is usually 3-6 months. The longer the delay in treatment, the worse the clinical outcome. Early detection has been shown to be possible. Second generation drugs are preferred. Treatment of prodromal cases with cognitive behavioral or drug therapy may prevent or delay schizophrenia."
9781910797853,chp6,"This requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes clinical nurse specialists who can offer psychosocial support and continuity of care and can act as advocates for the patient to ensure that their needs are fully met . Blood transfusions are among the most important forms of supportive care for patients with leukemia . Fresh frozen plasma should be administered to patients with a significantly prolonged prothrombin time (exempli gratia before a procedure, or if there is bleeding or coagulopathy, as in acute promyelocytic leukemia), and cryoprecipitate should be given if fibrinogen levels are lower than 1-1.5 g/L . Patients with leukemia are at high risk of infection, partly because of the disease itself and partly because of the immune dysfunction induced by chemotherapy . Effective prevention and treatment of infections is therefore central to disease management . Antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis is usually given to patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are receiving intensive chemotherapy . However, studies have not shown any significant differences in infection rates in patients given neutropenic diets . Limited clinical trial data suggest that the use of growth factors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), accelerates neutrophil recovery and decreases infection risk in patients undergoing induction therapy . Such treatment may be considered in patients with leukemia at high risk of complications from infection . In practice, use of growth factors varies between centers, depending on the disease, the timing in relation to treatment and patient factors . In patients with ALL, a number of randomized clinical studies have been undertaken to determine the optimal duration of G-CSF treatment during induction chemotherapy . Similarly, in patients with AML, a few studies have shown improvements in neutrophil recovery times and reductions in the number of febrile days and incidence of documented infections following G-CSF treatment . Currently, few data support the concurrent use of GM-CSF in patients with ALL at the time of chemotherapy induction . The management and treatment of CRF will depend on fatigue severity, as assessed using a brief screening instrument, that can be as simple as asking: 'How would you rate your fatigue on a scale of 0-10 over the past 7 days?' As well as asking the patient how bad the fatigue is, it is important to determine how it affects daily activities and what makes the fatigue better or worse . Evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the management of CRF, including psychological, educational and support groups is limited and further studies are needed . Patients with leukemia may experience pain caused by the disease itself, complications of the disease, invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment effects or unrelated medical conditions (Table 6.5) . The use of oral care protocols, including patient education, pretreatment dental work to eliminate caries and gum disease, plaque removal, tooth brushing and mouth rinses, is recommended to reduce the incidence and severity of oral pain caused by mucositis . Certain leukemia treatments, such as some chemotherapy regimens or HSCT, can impair fertility, and this may be an important concern for younger patients wishing to start a family .","Supportive care for patients with leukemia manages the effects of disease activity and progression, as well as the adverse effects of therapy. Transfusion support, with or without the use of blood growth factors, may be required at many points in the disease process and becomes essential to continued survival in the later stages. The prevention and treatment of infection are of paramount importance. It is important not to overlook the importance of cancer-related fatigue. The level and nature of fatigue should be regularly assessed. Failure to control chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) on the first day of chemotherapy increases the risk of CINV on subsequent days and in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. Well-established guidelines for the use of effective antiemetic regimens are available. Patients with leukemia may experience pain caused by the disease itself, complications of the disease, invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment effects or unrelated medical conditions. Management of pain therefore requires a multidisciplinary approach. Surviving cancer can have a profound and lasting impact on patients, affecting both physical and mental health, professional and personal identity, sexuality and financial standing. Patients surviving leukemia may require support in a number of areas. The aim of palliative care is to provide the best possible quality of life for patients with advanced and untreatable disease and their families."
9781908541468,ch_5,"The term acute kidney injury (AKI) describes a sudden reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), within days or weeks, resulting in the accumulation of fluid and nitrogenous waste products usually excreted by the kidneys . Pregnancy can also cause AKI (Table 3.1), and renal disease can present for the first time during pregnancy . AKI may result from poor perfusion of the kidneys (prerenal), intrinsic renal disease or urinary tract obstruction (postrenal) . In general, prerenal AKI will recover rapidly once kidney perfusion is re-established . ATN is by far the most common cause of AKI, and is often seen in postoperative patients in a hospital setting, and in those with severe infections or multisystem disease (Table 3.2) . It is important to establish whether patients with poor kidney perfusion and accumulation of toxic metabolites have true prerenal AKI or whether they have established ATN . Urinary biochemistry may be helpful, since most patients with immediately reversible prerenal failure have a low urinary sodium concentration (< 20 mmol/L) and a high urine:plasma osmolality ratio (> 1.5) . It is important to establish whether acute uremia is due to AKI in previously normal kidneys, or whether it represents a rapid decline against a background of chronic kidney disease (CKD), id est acute on chronic kidney failure . In acute on chronic kidney failure, renal abnormalities, such as small kidneys in chronic glomerulonephritis or large cystic kidneys in adult polycystic kidney disease, will almost always be present . The most common cause of ATN is prolonged renal ischemia due to reduced kidney perfusion, which may be a result of volume depletion, septicemia, cardiac failure or renal artery obstruction . Management of AKI includes the treatment of any underlying cause, general medical management of kidney failure and, if necessary, renal replacement therapy (dialysis) . In prerenal failure, correction of volume depletion, using central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring when necessary, should result in rapid recovery of kidney function (Table 3.4) . However, once ATN has developed, and in other causes of AKI, the patient will often be oliguric for several days or weeks . Most patients are oliguric and, in general, should be provided with a volume of fluid equal to the output on the previous day, plus at least an extra 500 mL if pyrexia is present . As many of the drugs prescribed for patients with AKI are excreted via the kidney, doses must be adjusted and drug levels monitored accordingly . Patients with kidney failure are susceptible to infection, so it is important to take great care of intravenous lines, to perform regular cultures of body fluids and to use antibiotics early . In oliguric or anuric patients, the fluid intake required for feeding generally means that dialysis will be necessary (Table 3.5) . In rhabdomyolysis with myoglobulinuria, alkaline diuresis may prevent the development of severe kidney failure, but must be undertaken with care in oliguric patients . Most patients with ATN should recover kidney function, provided that they survive the underlying illness . Survival in AKI depends on the cause, and mortality remains high (40-80%) in patients with multiple organ failure .","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common and often reversible if diagnosed promptly. Recognition and management of volume depletion or overload is crucial in the early management of AKI. Patients require frequent re-assessment and measurement of physiological parameters (including urine output), and daily measurement of serum electrolytes. Drug doses often need to be modified. Acute tubular necrosis has no specific treatment other than volume control, and there is no benefit in the routine use of dopamine or furosemide. AKI is a risk factor for the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease."
9781910797150,ch04,"Clinicians have a wide variety of antiemetics to choose from for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), and patients should receive the most effective antiemetic agents available . Prophylactic control of acute and delayed CINV that occurs as a result of cisplatin- or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC)-based chemotherapy or other highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) requires an initial three-drug regimen, administered before chemotherapy starts on day 1 of treatment (Figures 4.1 and 4.2) . This should include a 5-HT receptor antagonist (RA) (granisetron, ondansetron, tropisetron, dolasetron or palonosetron; see pages 25-34), dexamethasone (see page 43) and a neurokinin (NK)-1 RA (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, rolapitant or netupitant/NEPA; see pages 34-43) . Two studies have compared the second-generation 5-HT RA palonosetron with ondansetron and granisetron in the prevention of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting . When administered without an NK-1 RA, palonosetron was statistically superior to the other 5-HT RAs in its control of CINV in patients receiving both MEC and HEC . International guidelines recommend the use of palonosetron as the preferred agent because of its higher efficacy compared with ondansetron or granisetron (see above) . One of the netupitant-palonosetron (NEPA) clinical trials involving patients receiving HEC included a comparative arm of oral aprepitant plus intravenous ondansetron . Standard prophylactic control of acute and delayed CINV that may occur as a result of a non-AC MEC requires a combination of a 5-HT RA (palonosetron is preferred) and dexamethasone administered before chemotherapy on day 1, followed by dexamethasone treatment on days 2-3 for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting (Figure 4.3) . Prophylactic control of carboplatin-based CINV requires a triple-drug combination of a NK-1 RA, a 5-HT RA and dexamethasone before chemotherapy is administered on day 1 . There are no data for rolapitant or netupitant in patients receiving multiple-day cisplatin treatment, and the optimal doses of 5-HT RA and dexamethasone have yet to be determined . Limited evidence from clinical studies support the choice of antiemetic therapy or of any treatment at all for patients receiving low or minimally emetogenic chemotherapy . Patients with no previous history of nausea and vomiting who undergo chemotherapy of low emetic potential as an intermittent schedule could be managed with a single antiemetic agent such as dexamethasone, a 5-HT RA or a dopamine RA (Figure 4.6) . In a phase III study, 179 patients were randomized to receive ondansetron and dexamethasone with or without aprepitant on each day of the high-dose preparative regimen . The efficacy of aprepitant has also been evaluated in a phase III study in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing a high-dose chemotherapy regimen of intravenous melphalan, 100 mg/m, on days 1-2, with autologous stem cell transplantation on day 4 . The literature on the use of specific agents for particular chemotherapy regimens in children is not as well developed as that in adults, mainly because the phase III clinical trials performed for the approval of 5-HT and NK-1 RAs were performed in adults only . The main antiemetics administered to children have been the 5-HT RAs (ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron) with or without the use of corticosteroids .","The primary goal of CINV therapy is the prevention of nausea and vomiting. Patients should be individually evaluated for their specific risk factors as well as the level of anxiety present before the first course of treatment. Outcomes are improved by following international guidelines when selecting the antiemetic regimen to use in relation to emetogenicity of the type of chemotherapy involved. The triple-drug regimen of a NK-1 receptor antagonist (RA), 5-HT RA and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The two-drug combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone before chemotherapy is recommended for patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy; no antiemetic should be administered routinely for patients receiving minimally emetogenic chemotherapy. The final choice of antiemetic agent will depend on efficacy, toxicity and cost. To determine overall cost-effectiveness of any given regimen, the acquisition cost of the antiemetic agent should be weighed against the probability and cost of post-chemotherapy visits to the clinic or emergency department and/or admissions to hospital. The incidence and severity of CINV in children is similar ito that in adults. The use of antiemetics in children should follow the same principles as those used to treat adults."
9781910797662,ch01,"An estimated 541 000 new cases of bladder cancer occurred globally in 2016, with 188 000 deaths . Most cases of bladder cancer are non-muscle-invasive urothelial cancers, which can usually be cured; the 5-year survival rate for these cancers is more than 95% . However, invasive or metastatic bladder cancer is a frequent cause of cancer death, accounting for approximately 17 000 deaths annually in the USA and 188 000 globally . Age-standardized death rates for bladder cancer are 5.1 per 100 000 person-years in men and 1.5 per 100 000 person-years in women . Some data suggest that the global impact of bladder cancer is decreasing, even though incidence continues to rise, with a 9.6% decrease in the age-standardized rate for years of life lost between 2005 and 2015 . The lifetime risk of developing bladder cancer before 79 years of age is 1/36 for men and 1/165 for women in high sociodemographic index countries, and 1/122 and 1/310, respectively, in low sociodemographic index countries . Sidestream (secondary/passive) exposure to cigarette smoke is also a significant but insidious risk factor that may be difficult to avoid . Cigar and pipe tobacco smoking are also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, although the effect size seems to be less than with cigarettes . No clear increase in the risk of bladder cancer has been reported in marijuana smokers . Other occupations associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer due to carcinogen exposure are listed in Table 1.2 . The importance of dietary factors in the etiology of bladder cancer remains unclear . Caffeine has long been thought to be implicated in bladder cancer but the effects of confounding factors have been difficult to untangle . A meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies concluded that coffee consumption was associated with a 33% increase in the odds ratio for development of bladder cancer, and the argument was strengthened by the finding that bladder cancer risk was increased in non-smoking coffee drinkers . Long-term ingestion of drinking water contaminated with nitrate derived from fertilizers or human or animal waste has been linked with an increased risk of bladder cancer in postmenopausal women . Cyclophosphamide, used in the treatment of various malignancies and autoimmune conditions, sometimes at very high doses, has known bladder carcinogenic effects . Latency is relatively short - the time between exposure and subsequent bladder cancer diagnosis is 6-13 years . The risk of subsequent bladder cancer can be reduced in the oncology setting by minimizing the cumulative dose, although this is not always feasible . Co-administration of the chemoprotectant 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA) reduces the rate of cyclophosphamide-related cystitis and may reduce the risk of subsequent bladder cancer . Pelvic irradiation for conditions such as cervical cancer has been linked to a 4-fold increase in the risk of bladder cancer . Chronic infection or inflammation due to indwelling suprapubic or Foley catheters in patients with spinal cord injury and other conditions has been linked to an increased incidence of bladder cancer, especially squamous cell cancer . Chronic kidney stones may also lead to chronic inflammation and an increased risk of bladder cancer .","Bladder cancer is a common tumor; each year approximately 17 000 people in the USA die from the disease, and 188 000 globally. Bladder cancer incidence has a male-to-female ratio of 4:1. The incidence increases with age, with a median age at presentation of 60-65 years. Bladder cancer has many etiological risk factors, most of which are avoidable; the most common cause is cigarette smoking. Some familial syndromes and genetic predispositions increase the risk of bladder cancer."
9781910797105,ch02,"Strictly speaking, schizophrenia is a syndrome - a disorder for which there is no objective test or pathology, but which is identified by a characteristic cluster of symptoms that last for a certain time . These specific types of delusions and hallucinations became known as 'Schneider's first-rank symptoms' (Table 2.2), although they also occasionally occur in other serious psychiatric disorders . The two main classification systems in use worldwide are the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) (Tables 2.3 and 2.4) . The main differences are that the DSM-5 states a minimum duration of symptoms, including prodromal symptoms, of 6 months, and includes deterioration of social functioning, whereas the ICD-10 specifies just 1 month of symptoms . Attenuated psychosis syndrome is included in Section 3 of DSM-5, meaning more research is required before it becomes adopted as a formal diagnosis . In contrast to the dependence on traditional diagnostic systems of mental disorders, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) are organized according to domains of behavior, which cut across different diagnostic categories and are hypothesized to be linked more closely to genetics and other neuroscience constructs . The use of structured rating scales to assess symptoms and function allows us to track clinical change over time and to assess outcome . Outcome of schizophrenia can be measured in terms of severity of symptoms, cognitive function or social outcome, or by related constructs such as quality of life or patient satisfaction (Table 2.6) . Measurable dimensions of outcome and the most widely used rating scales used to make these assessments are detailed below . The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is now the most widely used of the symptom rating scales (Table 2.7) . It comprises 30 items in three subscales that rate positive, negative and general symptoms, respectively . Alternatively, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Scales for the Assessment of Positive/Negative Symptoms (SAPS/SANS) may be used to track changes in positive, negative and general symptoms . The Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) is specifically designed to assess depressive symptoms in people with schizophrenia, and has been shown to be reliable and to have good construct validity . Social functioning is a less frequently measured, but very important, outcome . The Social Functioning Scale is probably the best instrument, although is not greatly sensitive to change . The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is probably the most widely used schizophrenia-specific scale . Other scales such as the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36), the World Health Organization's Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL) and the EuroQol Group's EQ-5D are generic scales that claim to be appropriate for use across different physical and mental disorders . The assessment of cognitive function and capacity has become increasingly important with the increased recognition of the role that cognitive impairments play in poor outcome . The Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale (SCoRS) is an interview-based assessment of cognitive function .","There are three major symptom clusters: positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms and behavioral disorganization. Cognitive impairments and negative symptoms have the greatest prognostic importance for functional outcome. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) provide the two principal diagnostic systems used to diagnose people with schizophrenia. It is important to rate social and functional outcomes, as well as symptoms."
9781908541420,ch_8,"In adults, exacerbations are responsible for loss of work time, emergency asthma attendances to primary care practitioners and hospital presentation and admission . While individuals with such a food allergy often present with signs of anaphylaxis, acute asthma is a major component of a severe food reaction for some and it requires recognition and treatment in its own right . Regular use of controller asthma medication substantially reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of an acute asthma attack . All individuals who present with an acute exacerbation should be asked what controller treatment they are taking, and consideration should be given to introducing or adjusting regular maintenance medication in order to prevent such exacerbations in the future . It is important for patients and clinicians alike to recognize the signs of a severe asthma attack and know when to seek further help . Most often, patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma describe their asthma as being 'out of control' . All patients presenting to a doctor with an acute exacerbation of asthma must be assessed objectively for airflow obstruction by PEF measurement, or by blood gas measurement if PEF measurement is not possible . Patients with asthma should have a personal written asthma action plan that provides information to aid recognition of an acute attack and lists treatment options (see Chapter 6) . For less severe attacks that do not require hospital presentation, the first step is to increase regular bronchodilator therapy (however, frequent symptoms and frequent requirement for bronchodilator suggest that further treatment is needed) . For those with more severe asthma, prompt access to a supply of oral corticosteroids is important to prevent severe exacerbations, and such patients may keep a store of these medications at home . Hospital referral is indicated for all patients who have persisting severe asthma or symptoms despite oral corticosteroid therapy and for those in whom asthma is severe (see Figure 6.1) . Patients with a history of severe or brittle (unpredictable and severe) asthma, intensive care admission, difficulties in accessing care or psychosocial problems may require hospital referral at an earlier stage . Admission to hospital enables the administration of parenteral asthma therapy and observation of a patient with severe airflow obstruction to ensure there is a response to asthma treatment, thereby ensuring patient safety . Further risk factors are a previous life-threatening asthma attack, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year and social or physical isolation from medical care, including psychosocial disability, especially psychiatric illness, substance abuse, poor treatment adherence and difficulty accessing treatment . Protective factors for asthma death are regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and possession of a personal written asthma management plan . Treatment of acute severe asthma in hospital . All patients should receive inhaled bronchodilator, and those with moderate or severe exacerbations should receive oral or parenteral corticosteroid therapy . Ongoing review in hospital ensures recovery and introduces patients to their ongoing preventative medication and the management plan likely to be required following a hospital admission for asthma . It is important that asthma control is assessed following a hospital admission and that ongoing maintenance medication is adjusted accordingly .","Asthma exacerbations are one of the major causes of morbidity in asthma, resulting in loss of work time in adults or school absence in children, and emergency hospital presentation and admission. Causes of acute asthma include viral respiratory infections, acute allergen exposure, food allergies and some medications such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Acute exacerbations of asthma usually respond well to inhaled beta -agonists and a course of oral corticosteroid. After hospital admission, patients should receive appropriate medication, a written plan of what to do if their asthma worsens and a follow-up medical appointment for ongoing management and measurement of lung function."
9781910797297,chp2,"CTCL are a rare group of T-cell malignancies primarily involving the skin . Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) is the term used when the patient presents with follicular lesions, id est patches, plaques or tumors with follicular accentuation (Figures 2.14 and 2.15) . Folliculotropic MF may present with lesions limited to patches of MF showing follicular accentuation +/− alopecia, +/− cysts, or with thick plaques and/or tumors with follicular accentuation often showing a predilection to the head and neck . Patients with lesions limited to follicular patches may have a similar prognosis to classical MF whilst those with dense follicular plaques have a poorer prognosis similar to those with advanced tumor stage classical MF . Pagetoid reticulosis is a variant of MF that presents as a solitary patch or plaque, usually located on the extremities and acral sites . About 70% of patients with classic mycosis fungoides (MF) present with erythematous scaly patches (Figures 2.1 - 2.3) or plaques (Figures 2.4 and 2.5) in a 'sun bathing suit' distribution on non-sun-exposed sites (id est hips, buttocks, groin, lower trunk, axillae and breasts) . These early-stage lesions consist of atypical T lymphocytes that infiltrate the skin and show affinity for the epidermis (epidermotropism) (see Chapter 3) . In addition to the physical disfiguration associated with these skin lesions, patients with MF experience itching (pruritus) and pain, which generally worsens in more advanced disease, all of which has a negative effect on quality of life . About 25% of patients will progress to advanced disease, with survival of 10-25 years . Patients with these late-stage lesions tend to have rapidly progressive disease and a poor survival of 1-4 years, with spread to lymph nodes or internal organs (viscera) . Sézary syndrome (SS) is a form of CTCL that presents as advanced disease with erythroderma (Figure 2.19), lymphadenopathy and peripheral blood involvement . Primary cutaneous anaplastic CD30+ large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) presents with rapidly enlarging skin tumors, often with central necrosis (Figure 2.22) . Systemic spread rarely occurs, but relapses in the skin are common . Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a self-resolving form of primary CD30+ CTCL that usually occurs in early adulthood . It presents with recurrent nodules and papules, typically less than 1 cm in diameter, at distant sites that become necrotic before resolving to form an atrophic scar (Figure 2.23) . Given their clinical, prognostic and immunophenotypic differences these are now considered two separate entities: SPTCL and primary cutaneous gammaδ T-cell lymphoma . SPTCL is an indolent disease that is confined to the subcutis, presenting as solitary or multiple nodules and plaques . Primary cutaneous gammaδ T-cell lymphoma has an aggressive clinical course, usually with systemic spread, and may be complicated by a hemophagocytic syndrome . Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder typically presents with a small solitary dermal tumor on the face, neck or upper trunk, and has a favorable clinical course . Most forms of cutaneous lymphoma have a nodal counterpart: systemic nodal lymphomas may involve the skin during the disease course and, on occasions, may present with skin involvement .","Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a rare group of lymphomas that affect the skin. Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the commonest type of CTCL and typically presents in the early stages with patches and plaques. Early-stage MF may progress to advanced disease with skin tumors and blood involvement, with lymph node or visceral spread. Some patients (30%) present with advanced disease. Early-stage MF has an excellent prognosis and long survival (10+ years), whilst the advanced stages are rapidly progressive in 1-4 years. Sézary syndrome is the erythrodermic form of CTCL that presents in advanced disease with leukemic blood involvement. Cutaneous lymphomas may be CD30+, and this group forms a spectrum from lymphomatoid papulosis with relapsing and remitting lesions to large cell anaplastic lymphomas that may grow rapidly. These types of CTCL have an excellent prognosis and should be differentiated from transformed MF, which also has large atypical CD30+ cells. Other forms of CTCL are rare and include subcutaneous panniculitis-like lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder."
9781910797006,ch06,"Most cigarette smokers (> 85%) are addicted to nicotine and experience a well-defined withdrawal syndrome to varying degrees following cessation (Table 6.1) . Therapeutic interventions targeted at individual smokers' susceptibilities are under intensive investigation . Additional non-pharmacological support, which can include behavioral, cognitive and motivational support, and pharmacological therapy can further increase quit rates . Current recommendations are, therefore, that all physicians establish smoking status as a 'vital sign' at every visit and undertake appropriate smoking cessation intervention (Figure 6.1) . System approaches ensure smoking cessation intervention is integrated into each practice and is fully supported by the healthcare system . Smokers not yet ready to quit should be provided with a brief intervention to increase motivation . Data show clearly that the more behavioral support offered the more likely a smoker is to quit . Treatment with first-line medicines for smoking cessation can double or triple quit rates compared with those achieved without pharmacological support . First-line treatments for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy, varenicline and bupropion (also known as amfebutamone) . Nicotine replacement therapy is available in several formulations: polacrilex gum, transdermal systems, inhalers, nasal sprays and lozenges . The use of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation is based on the pharmacokinetics of nicotine as a psychoactive drug . The concept behind nicotine replacement therapy, therefore, is to provide a steady-state level that can protect against the symptoms of withdrawal without providing the reinforcement that contributes to addiction . Currently available nicotine formulations provide only partial nicotine replacement for most smokers, and none completely prevents withdrawal symptoms, but they do reduce them . More importantly, nicotine replacement therapies increase quit rates . The general strategy for their use is to establish a quit day and to start nicotine replacement on that day . Because the available formulations generally provide incomplete nicotine replacement, combination therapy can be considered . Consistent with its ability to partially activate this receptor, individuals who quit smoking while being treated with varenicline have reduced withdrawal symptoms . In addition, individuals who continue to smoke experience less of the rewarding effects of nicotine, consistent with the antagonism expected of a partial agonist (Figure 6.3) . Clinical trials suggest that varenicline can achieve abstinence rates that are three times better than placebo, and that are better than both bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy . This agent is available as an antidepressant and can therefore be used off-label for smoking cessation by physicians comfortable with its use . Currently, no data have demonstrated the efficacy of electronic cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid . For this reason, smokers interested in combustible tobacco use cessation should be offered approved modalities (exempli gratia nicotine replacement therapy, nicotinic receptor agonists) . All smokers making a serious attempt to quit should therefore be offered follow-up assessment . Such programs can, however, provide important support for many smokers, and every practitioner should be able to refer patients for intensive intervention . Data show that quit rates increase when more personnel at more levels participate in smoking cessation therapy .","Smoking should be regarded as a primary chronic relapsing disease. All serious attempts to quit should be maximally supported with behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Repeated efforts by the physician are required to provide sufficient motivation for a quit attempt. Relapses are common, and should engender repeated attempts. Smoking cessation activities should be an integrated part of every medical practice."
9781910797181,ch02,"The prevalence of cigarette smoking varies from country to country, as do rates for men and women (Figure 2.1) . In countries such as the UK and the USA, rates are relatively low overall, and rates for women are slightly lower than those for men . However, in Asian and African countries the prevalence of smoking is much higher in men than in women . Within countries, smoking prevalence varies according to socioeconomic status and level of education . In high-income countries such as the UK and the USA, smoking rates are higher among less affluent and less well-educated groups . In general, women from Asian backgrounds are subject to strong cultural taboos against smoking, so that prevalence in women is much lower than in men . In the UK, there is also a high prevalence of smoking in people of African-Caribbean descent . In the USA, native American communities have particularly high smoking rates (Figure 2.3) . Figure 2.4 shows the decrease in smoking in men and women in Japan, the UK and the USA since the 1960s . It is widely thought that it will become increasingly difficult to reduce smoking prevalence in countries such as the USA and UK as the persisting smokers will be more 'hard core' . Moreover, as the prevalence of smoking has dropped, so has the daily cigarette consumption of the remaining smokers . The commonly held view in the UK and the USA that women are more likely to smoke than men is unfounded . In some other countries there is evidence of an increase, rather than a decrease, in smoking prevalence, as tobacco companies expand their markets . In England, just under 90% of smokers smoke daily . In the USA, the proportion of non-daily smokers has increased to around 25%, and is highest in states with the lowest smoking prevalence and most active tobacco control policies . It should be noted that non-daily smokers do take in substantial amounts of nicotine - and probably, therefore, tobacco-related toxins from smoking . Further, non-daily smoking confers substantial health risks, especially from cardiovascular diseases . It is therefore misleading to report only daily smoking in the headline prevalence figures as is done in some countries such as Australia . In the USA and the UK, people most commonly start smoking at 13-16 years of age . In many western countries, those with an antisocial personality and/or lacking engagement with social values are more likely to take up smoking, as are those with a tendency toward sensation- or thrill-seeking (a characteristic common in teenagers) . Some research has suggested that the influence is not one of direct role models, but may be related to a permissive attitude to smoking . The heritability of take-up of regular smoking in western countries has been put at around 50% . Smokers' attitudes and attempts to stop smoking . In both the USA and the UK about 2% of men smoke pipes or cigars, but not cigarettes . Although the health risks from smokeless tobacco are substantially lower than those from smoking, they may nevertheless be significant .","Smoking prevalence varies across countries from less than 20% to more than 60% in men, and from less than 5% to more than 30% in women. Smoking prevalence is higher in men than in women in almost every country. In industrialized English-speaking countries (which have all implemented tobacco control measures), smoking prevalence has declined markedly, and in countries such as the UK and Australia with strong anti-tobacco policies it continues to decline. In western industrialized countries, smoking prevalence is greater among people with lower educational level and greater socioeconomic disadvantage. Most smokers smoke every day, and in the USA and the UK 70% smoke within 30 minutes of waking. Most smokers start during adolescence; initial take-up and transition to regular smoking are linked to both genetic and social factors. In most developed countries, most smokers want to stop smoking, usually because of health concerns and cost, and try to do so many times."
9781908541727,ch01,"A careful history of the patient's eye symptoms plus looking for a few critical signs of serious disease will help you identify how urgently the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist, or whether you can treat them yourself . Is it blurred vision, visual field loss (a blank or blurry patch in the central or peripheral vision), pain, redness, irritation, foreign body sensation ('something is in my eye') or double vision? Patients who give a history of being struck in the eye with a fragment of high-speed metal (such as when hammering metal), or those who have received sharp trauma to the eye, need urgent referral for a slit-lamp examination and an X-ray to determine whether a perforating injury, with or without an intraocular foreign body, is present, even if the results of your examination are normal . It is important to ask specific questions to find out whether the patient has a 'good' or 'bad' red eye (see Chapter 2): does the patient have blurred vision, pain or photophobia? If the patient has any of these symptoms, and you can't find a corneal foreign body or other easily treatable explanation for the red eye, it is a 'bad' red eye and needs urgent ophthalmic referral . A patient who has recently had eye surgery and presents with a red eye or blurred vision obviously needs urgent referral . All patients with a red eye should be asked if they wear contact lenses, as this greatly increases the risk of an infective corneal ulcer . A diabetic patient complaining of the acute or subacute onset of blurred vision, floaters or field loss should always be taken seriously and referred urgently; patients with diabetes have a high risk of serious eye disease, including diabetic maculopathy and vitreous hemorrhage from proliferative retinopathy (see Chapter 8) . All patients with a red eye and blurred vision, pain or photophobia need urgent pressure testing by an ophthalmologist or optometrist to exclude acute glaucoma . Move close to the patient and view the optic disc in each eye, noting whether the disc looks normal or abnormal (Figure 1.7); trace the retinal blood vessels away from the disc . It is important to remember to examine the optic discs by direct ophthalmoscopy in all patients complaining of headache to see if bilateral disc swelling caused by raised intracranial pressure (papilledema) is present . Remember that although the direct ophthalmoscope gives good images of the optic discs it has only a very small field of view; a 'normal' direct ophthalmoscope examination therefore does not exclude the possibility of serious intraocular disease . You now have two hands available to test two of the four visual field quadrants of the patient's right eye at the same time . Eye movements should be tested in patients who complain of double vision, or in children who present with a squint ('turned eye') . This should be performed for all patients complaining of blurred vision, flashes, floaters or visual field loss .","Eye disease cannot be accurately diagnosed without a slit-lamp microscope examination. If in any doubt, refer the patient. Carry out a basic eye assessment by:- identifying the presenting symptoms- taking a complete patient history- performing as thorough an examination as you can with the equipment you have available. Test visual acuity (VA) in every patient who complains of blurred vision. Test the visual field to confrontation to detect disease that would be missed by testing for VA alone. Perform the 'swinging light test' to check for a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in all patients who complain of blurred vision, flashes, floaters or visual field loss. The presence of an RAPD signifies serious retinal or optic nerve disease. In patients with red eye/s, the use of a blue light and fluorescein drops may identify a corneal ulcer that is invisible with white light alone. Although useful for viewing the optic disc, the commonly available handheld direct ophthalmoscope is not a particularly good instrument for examining the retina. Patients who exhibit 'normal fundoscopy' with the direct ophthalmoscope can still have serious disease that is detectable only by examination with the slit-lamp microscope and retinal lenses. Use your patients' eye symptoms and signs to triage them according to their need for referral to an ophthalmologist: those with serious eye emergencies who require urgent referral, those with non-urgent problems who require routine referral and those whom you can observe or treat yourself. - identifying the presenting symptoms - taking a complete patient history - performing as thorough an examination as you can with the equipment you have available."
9781910797433,ch01,"Numerous factors have been reported to influence the risk of ovarian cancer (Table 1.1): age and genetic predisposition are among the most important factors associated with an increased risk, while oral contraceptive use, prolonged breast-feeding, tubal ligation and hysterectomy have been shown to be protective . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the strongest known genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer, accounting for around 65-85% of all cases of hereditary ovarian cancers . Mutations in these genes were first identified in patients with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (Lynch syndrome), who are also at increased risk of other solid tumors, including carcinomas of the endometrium, stomach, breast and pancreas . In a landmark analysis of 45 epidemiological studies, the use of oral contraceptives was associated with proportional reductions in the risk of ovarian cancer of 15-29% over 5 years . Similarly, a meta-analysis of six studies in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations showed that oral contraceptive use reduced the risk for ovarian cancer by more than 40% (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.73) in this high-risk population . Data from the Million Women Study showed that the risk of ovarian cancer was 53% higher in long-term (> 5 years) users of estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) than in 'never users' . Environmental factors, including diet and obesity and exposure to talc, have been reported to influence the risk of ovarian cancer, but in many cases systematic reviews or meta-analyses have not demonstrated significant associations . One potential risk factor for which an association has been reported is smoking; in a meta-analysis of 51 epidemiological studies, including over 28 000 women with ovarian cancer, the relative risk (RR) of ovarian cancer was slightly but significantly increased in smokers compared with non-smokers (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.1-1.11, p = 0.01) . A recent meta-analysis showed that prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy reduced the risk of ovarian cancer by more than 80% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.19, 95% CI 0.13-0.27, p < 0.00001) in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations . However, a prespecified analysis that excluded prevalent cases showed a significant 20% reduction in deaths from ovarian cancer among women receiving multimodal screening: the overall reduction was 8% in years 0-7 and 28% in years 7-14 . The UK Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UKFOCSS), a sister trial to the UKCTOCS, recruited 4531 women with an estimated lifetime risk of ovarian/fallopian tube cancer of at least 10%, based on family history or predisposing mutations . The study established ROCA-based screening as an option for women at high risk of ovarian cancer who defer or decline risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy, given its high sensitivity and significant stage shift . Screening had no significant effect on the incidence of deaths from ovarian cancer (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.82-1.71), but surgery following false-positive diagnoses was associated with serious complications in 15% of patients . On the basis of these results, the US Preventative Services Task Force concluded that ovarian cancer screening should not be offered to women at low risk of the disease .","Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, and a leading cause of cancer death among women. The highest incidence rates are seen in non-Hispanic white women, and the lowest in African or Asian women. Survival rates in ovarian cancer are the lowest of any gynecologic malignancy, largely because the majority of cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are the most important genetic factors contributing to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, the genetic risk factors known at present account for less than half of the excess risk of the disease. Oral contraceptive use is strongly protective against ovarian cancer. Risk-reducing surgery (salpingo-oophorectomy) is recommended for high-risk women up to the age of 45 years. To date, large screening trials based on CA125 measurement and transvaginal ultrasound have failed to show any significant benefits in terms of reducing deaths from ovarian cancer."
9783318067095,ch2,"Clinical care is familiar to most readers from their own experiences with doctors, hospitals and other parts of the healthcare system . Historically, its primary purpose has been to address health problems, and it has long been grounded in the interaction between a patient and a healthcare provider . With the introduction of connected technologies, there have also been attempts to move healthcare activities into the home, decreasing the need for face-to-face interactions with providers . Clinical care activities include a wide range of diagnostic and treatment processes and procedures, such as . Clinical research may include some of the same activities as clinical care, but the primary purpose of clinical research is to develop a better understanding of factors influencing health and illness in people . When a person (exempli gratia patient or healthy individual) volunteers to enroll in clinical research, they are called a research participant . In interventional studies, participants receive some form of treatment, education or support (Box 2.1) . Clinical trials are a subset of interventional studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention . In non-interventional studies, participants do not receive an intervention . Like any other medical tool, at-home monitoring technologies need to prove their worth . Developers, working with researchers and other experts, must demonstrate that these tools produce clinically meaningful information that leads to clinically meaningful improvements in care, processes and outcomes . Digital measurement in medicine will not replace clinics or clinicians entirely, nor would we want them to . The delivery of, for example, intravenous drugs or surgery, and the value that patients place on their relationship with their provider, cannot be replaced by digital tools . Nonetheless, when used appropriately, digital measurements can improve care by giving clinicians more complete information . . Although organizations like the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) have made inroads in addressing the first two questions, the field will need to address these issues and adopt consensus solutions for these tools to be truly integrated into clinical care . From this perspective, the industry splits into 'premarket' research activities, drug and device development in the life sciences and biotech, and 'postmarket' commercial activities, where the products are used in clinical applications like in the hospital . Often, government regulators like the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) are the gatekeepers between what is considered research (premarket) and what is part of standard of care and commercial activities (postmarket) . National governments are responsible for establishing national medicines and medical device standards and regulatory authorities that determine what claims product manufacturers can make when they go to market in that country . As of 2015, 121 of the 194 members of the World Health Organization had a national regulatory authority responsible for implementing and enforcing product regulations specific to medical devices . Across the Atlantic, this oversight is provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and in Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) .","Digital medicine holds the promise of bringing complex medical measurements, observations and interventions outside the clinic. Clinical research uses include interventional and non-interventional trials, although many practicalities and data management issues are yet to become commodities. Regulation of digital medicine varies widely across the globe."
9781910797181,ch06,"Research has shown that brief opportunistic advice from a physician can trigger an attempt to stop smoking in about 40% of cases . If the smoker then attempts to quit with no treatment, he or she has only a 5% chance of long-term success . Hence, the overall effect of the physician's advice alone (without assistance) is to create one long-term ex-smoker for about every 50 people advised . This may seem like a very low figure, but when one considers that the advice can take as little as 30 seconds, that the cost, taking into account the physician's time, is no more than £10 or US$15, and that stopping smoking yields an average of up to 10 extra years of healthy life, then, bearing in mind that some smokers who stop will relapse and others who did not respond will stop later, the cost per healthy life-year gained can be as little as £1000 or US$1500 . Taking into account the cost savings on smoking-related illness and time off work, brief advice to stop smoking actually results in a cost saving . Second, without effective treatment for nicotine dependence (see below), it is mostly less-dependent smokers who stop in response to brief advice from their physician . For these reasons, national and international professional guidelines suggest that physicians aim to raise the issue of smoking with patients known to be smokers at least once a year . The goal is to trigger a quit attempt in as many smokers as possible and to encourage as many smokers as possible to use effective treatments to help that quit attempt succeed . If not, then rather than berating the smoking or even advising the patient to stop, the evidence suggests that clinicians should just advise smokers that there are now effective methods to help with quitting and encourage the smoker to try one of these . It seems that better results are obtained and the interaction with the patient is more positive if the clinician simply advises all patients about the best ways of stopping if they want to and encourage them to use one of them . The clinician should refer the smoker to a trained stop-smoking specialist (whether in-person services or those offered via telephone) if one is available, as he or she will be able to provide the full range of help . If, however, the physician does not have the training or time to provide behavioral support, he or she should discuss appropriate medication and provide whatever help and support he or she can . When discussing medication with the patient, the clinician needs to recognize that many smokers have already tried nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline (Champix/Chantix) . As well as having a vital role in encouraging smokers to stop, referring them to cessation treatment services and prescribing medication to aid the quit attempt, clinicians must also be aware of the wide range of interactions between smoking and the clinical conditions that they manage . Several useful resources are available to assist in educating clinicians about smoking .","Smoking is an essential vital sign; it is imperative that patients' smoking status be recorded and the record kept up to date. A physician's advice on smoking has a positive effect and need take as little as 30 seconds. The advice should focus, taking a small amount of time in routine consultations at least once a year, on telling all smokers about the best ways of stopping rather than berating smokers or just advising them to stop."
9781910797631,chp7,"The prevalence of depression among a range of medically ill populations has been widely investigated, and this research shows rates of depression two- to threefold higher than among comparable groups of people not experiencing such diseases (Table 7.1) . The extent of these adverse effects is particularly clear for cardiovascular disease: depression is a well-recognized risk factor for new onset and for recurrences of established disease, and among patients with heart disease the relative risk of subsequent cardiac mortality is increased threefold in those with depression compared with those who are not depressed . This led the WHO to highlight the negative effects of depression on physical illnesses among one of its ten most important global public health statistics for 2007, and to develop policy and practice guidance for greater integration of care between primary and specialist services and physical and mental health services such as outlined by NHS England in its Five Year Forward View policy document (2014) and in reviews by the Australian Health Policy Collaboration . Depression may increase the likelihood of developing certain medical conditions; evidence from longitudinal studies involving occupational and geographic cohorts shows clearly that a history of depression is linked to developing cardiovascular disease and to the onset of diabetes . The most intuitively plausible link between physical illness and depression is that the stresses, role limitations and pain related to a medical condition may cause depression . Reviews of relevant studies have found an elevated risk of depression among people who have been diagnosed with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, diabetes, arthritis and heart disease; a systematic review of 20 prospective studies indicates that the increased risk is related to the disabling impacts of these diseases and their effects on sleep . The effects of disability as a risk factor for depression are most commonly identified in older people, but appear to operate across the age range . Shared genetic factors that increase the risk for both depression and particular physical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease may play a part in the relationship between medical conditions and depression . Healthcare professionals in primary and secondary medical care encounter a large (and increasing) number of people whose physical illnesses are complicated by mental health problems, and skills and confidence in assessing and monitoring symptoms and negotiating appropriate care are vital . Being able to identify depression in combination with long-term medical illnesses is an essential first step to ongoing monitoring and agreeing approaches to problem management, but this is complicated by a number of factors . Somatic symptoms retain their importance in assessing depression in people with physical disease, and a full assessment of all clinical features, together with relevant history and social factors, and including the person's own understanding of his or her problems, is always required . Although the presence of comorbid medical illness complicates treatment decisions, there is a strong evidence base to guide practice, with antidepressant and psychological treatments shown to be effective for depression and improving quality of life across many disorders - from diabetes and heart disease to cancer and COPD .","Depression is two to three times more common among people experiencing medical conditions, as physical illness increases the risks for depression and, vice versa, depression makes physical illness more likely. When depression and physical illnesses are combined, the course and outcome of both conditions are worsened, with increased disability, higher medical costs and greater likelihood of adverse outcomes (including death). People with depression are less likely to adhere to treatments for medical conditions or to adopt healthy behaviors and self-management for these health problems. Recognizing depression in people with physical health problems can be challenging, but being alert to the increased risk and using validated case-finding measures assist this process. There is a good evidence base for managing depression combined with medical conditions: selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are an appropriate first line drug treatment, and psychological therapies are effective."

Nivolumab, a fully humanized IgG4 PD-1 mAb, is licensed as second-line monotherapy for NSCLC of squamous cell histology; the approval for non-squamous histological subtypes will follow soon on the basis of the CHECKMATE-017 and CHECKMATE-057 trials . In 272 patients with pretreated advanced squamous NSCLC, nivolumab demonstrated a significant improvement in overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with docetaxel, with a 1-year OS of 42% versus 24%, respectively (Table 5.2) . In 582 patients with non-squamous NSCLC, nivolumab improved OS and ORR but not PFS (see Table 5.2) . Pembrolizumab, a highly selective, humanized IgG4 PD-1 mAb, is also licensed as second-line monotherapy for all pathological subtypes of NSCLC that express PD-L1, following the results of the KEYNOTE-001 and KEYNOTE-010 trials . In 1034 patients with previously treated NSCLC, OS and ORR were significantly greater for pembrolizumab independent of the dose compared with docetaxel (see Table 5.2) . Among the patients with at least 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1, pembrolizumab resulted in significantly longer PFS and OS than docetaxel, suggesting PD-L1 has value as a predictive biomarker . The ongoing OAK study will validate the efficacy of atezolizumab in patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC independently of PD-L1 positivity in tumor tissue . Durvalumab, a humanized IgG1 PD-L1 mAb, is much earlier on in its clinical development, with early phase studies demonstrating a safety profile and excellent response rates that were durable . Safety, tolerability and efficacy appear to be similar across all PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors; about 10% of patients experience grade 3-4 adverse events . These randomized phase III studies are comparing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alone with current platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimens, as summarized in Table 5.3 . Given the efficacy already seen with these drugs in advanced NSCLC, several adjuvant and neoadjvuant studies are under way (Table 5.4) . First-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC who do not have a driver mutation, with a response rate of about 30% and a median OS of 8-10 months (see Chapter 6) . Early data show impressive response rates, ranging from 33% to 55% in CHECKMATE-012, 30% to 58% in KEYNOTE-021, and 67% in early-phase atezolizumab studies . The concern with combining these therapies is toxicity, with reports of grade 3-4 adverse events ranging from 27% (KEYNOTE-021) to 45% (CHECKMATE-012) . Toxicity is a concern given the immune-related adverse events that have been seen with CTLA-4 antagonists . Following CHECKMATE 012, a tolerable schedule of nivolumab plus ipilimumab is the focus of a phase III clinical trial (CHECKMATE 227) in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC . KEYNOTE-021 combined pembrolizumab with ipilimumab in a dose escalation study in patients already treated with platinum chemotherapy . Preclinical and early phase clinical data from KEYNOTE-001 suggest that prior therapy with EGFR inhibitors is associated with a lack of response to PD-1 inhibition .","Nivolumab should be considered as a second-line treatment option for patients with non-squamous cell histology whose tumors are positive for programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and all patients with squamous cell histology. Pembrolizumab should be considered as a treatment option for all patients whose tumors are PD-L1 positive. Generally, programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors have a similar side-effect profile and efficacy. Combination strategies with both cytotoxic T-lymphoma-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) antagonism and first-line chemotherapy offer better response rates; however, caution needs to be exercised with the inherent risk of increased toxicity. Strong PD-L1 staining is a biomarker for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition."
9781910797181,ch07,"Structured behavioral support combined with medication (nicotine-replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion [formerly amfebutamone] or varenicline) is the treatment of choice to aid smokers who want to quit . Research has consistently shown that a structured behavioral support program, whether conducted with groups of smokers, one-to-one (face-to-face) with a specialist or by telephone with a trained counselor, can significantly increase a smoker's chances of long-term success in stopping smoking . Behavioral support programs typically begin with an assessment session in which the smoker's commitment to making a serious attempt to stop smoking is confirmed, his or her level of dependence is gauged and the schedule of sessions is explained . Three forms of medication are typically available to assist smokers in attempts to quit and are licensed in at least some countries: bupropion, varenicline and NRT (Table 7.1) . Bupropion and all forms of NRT have been shown to approximately double a smoker's chances of stopping successfully and remaining abstinent in the long term . There is evidence from one clinical trial that adding bupropion to varenicline (see below) increases smoking cessation rates in smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day . Given that NRT simply replaces some of the nicotine that smokers had been getting from cigarettes, there are few genuine contraindications, and the products have been found to be safe for use by patients with a range of medical conditions, including heart disease . Use in pregnancy is more controversial, because nicotine probably has some damaging effects on the fetus and randomized controlled trials have failed to show a benefit over placebo in terms of cessation - although one study did show an improvement in the health of the baby following birth . In general, the rational approach is to explain the risks to pregnant smokers and to suggest that they use NRT if the alternative would be to continue smoking . Studies also suggest that use of nicotine patches for 2 weeks before quitting improves the chances of success at stopping compared with the standard regimen of starting patch use on the quit day (even among patients who are not advised to reduce their smoking before quitting) . There is also evidence that continued use of nicotine patches after a smoker has lapsed (id est has had limited episodes of smoking) can increase the chances of recovering abstinence . However, both varenicline and NRT have been shown to be effective even in those smokers who previously failed on the treatment, and the same may be true of bupropion . While there are limited clinical trial data on their efficacy, the data available and a large population study strongly suggest that, on average, they have effectiveness similar to that of other nicotine products in aiding smoking cessation . Nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, has been shown to aid cessation in well-controlled clinical trials; in fact it has a similar level of effectiveness to bupropion . There is good evidence that structured behavioral support programs delivered by trained specialists can improve pregnant smokers' chances of stopping for the duration of the pregnancy .","A structured behavioral support program involving several sessions concentrated in the first few weeks after the quit date can significantly increase smokers' chances of stopping permanently. Sustained-release bupropion hydrochloride (Zyban) and nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT, in the form of chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalator, lozenges, sublingual tablets, mouth spray or dissolvable oral strips) increase smokers' chances of stopping considerably. The highest quit rates can be achieved with either varenicline (Chantix/Champix) or dual-form NRT (patch plus one of the other forms of NRT). NRT, varenicline and bupropion are among the safest medicines available, although bupropion carries a small risk of seizure and allergic reaction (about 1/1000). Electronic cigarettes have become very popular and may help many smokers to stop smoking. They are much safer than conventional cigarettes, even if used long term. Concerns exist around the way some of them are being marketed and the variability in quality. Nortriptyline and cytisine are both effective at helping smokers to stop and are very cheap. Cytisine (available in much of Central and Eastern Europe for several decades and available over the counter) offers a safe and effective low-cost treatment that can be given with minimal supervision. It has yet to receive a marketing license in most of the world. A combination of behavioral support and medication quadruples the chances of a successful quit attempt; these treatments are among the most cost-effective life-preserving interventions available to health professionals. Hypnotherapy and acupuncture have received little research attention in relation to smoking cessation; to date, no specific effect in aiding smoking cessation has been found."
9783318066241,ch5,"It provided accurate definitions for local and systemic complications and severity (mild/severe AP) . This chapter reviews the definitions for local and systemic complications, and the classification of severity, as provided by the RAC . Some patients with interstitial AP may develop acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFCs) (see page 42 . The clinical course of interstitial AP, if not complicated by APFCs, is usually uneventful, with a quick recovery, very low morbidity and no mortality . Necrotizing acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of necrosis of the pancreatic parenchyma, the peripancreatic fat, or both . Peripancreatic necrosis is characterized by a heterogeneous and non-liquid density collection in the peripancreatic fat tissue . Collections arising in the first 4 weeks following disease onset lack a defined wall . The RAC defines the following acute collections on the basis of their content . An APFC is defined as peripancreatic fluid (a homogeneous collection with fluid density with no intrapancreatic extension) associated with interstitial edematous pancreatitis with no associated peripancreatic necrosis . An acute necrotic collection is defined as a collection containing variable amounts of both fluid and necrosis (heterogeneous and non-liquid density of varying degrees) associated with necrotizing pancreatitis; the necrosis can involve the pancreatic parenchyma and/or the peripancreatic tissues . According to the RAC, these mature collections can be classified in the following ways . Pseudocyst: an encapsulated collection of fluid with a well-defined inflammatory wall, usually outside the pancreas with minimal or no necrosis (homogeneous fluid density on imaging) . Walled-off necrosis: a mature encapsulated collection of pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis (heterogeneous with liquid and non-liquid density with varying degrees of loculation) that has developed a well-defined inflammatory wall (see Figure 5.2) . In the RAC, gastric outlet dysfunction, splenic and portal vein thrombosis, and colonic necrosis are considered as other local complications of AP, although no formal definitions are provided . Exacerbation of pre-existing comorbidity, such as coronary artery disease or chronic lung disease secondary to AP, is defined as a systemic complication in the RAC . The severity of AP should be classified at discharge according to whether local and systemic complications developed during the course of the disease . In the first Atlanta classification published in 1993, AP was divided into mild (no complications) and severe (local or systemic complications) forms . This classification had a homogeneous mild category, without morbidity or mortality, but the severe category was heterogeneous, mixing patients with increased morbidity with others with a life-threatening condition . However, local or 'mild' systemic complications (exacerbation of previous comorbidity, transient OF) are associated with increased morbidity but very low mortality and these patients are considered as having moderate disease . Patients with persistent OF have a high risk of mortality, indicating severe disease . moderately severe disease with increased morbidity but a low risk of mortality . severe disease with maximum morbidity and a high risk of mortality . From a simplistic point of view, mild disease is defined by the absence of complications, severe disease as persistent OF, and patients with other local and systemic complications as having moderately severe disease .","Early liquid peripancreatic collections without necrosis are called acute peripancreatic fluid collections (APFCs). APFCs lasting for more than 4 weeks develop an encapsulating wall and are known as pseudocysts. Early collections associated with pancreatic and/or peripancreatic necrosis are called acute necrotic collections. Those lasting for more than 4 weeks and developing an encapsulating wall are known as walled-off necrosis. In the revised Atlanta classification, acute pancreatitis is defined as mild, moderately severe and severe. Mild disease is defined by the absence of complications, severe disease as persistent (> 48 hours) organ failure; patients with other local and systemic complications are classified as having moderately severe disease. Mild disease is associated with an uneventful disease course. Moderately severe disease results in increased morbidity and severe disease is associated with maximum morbidity and increased mortality."
9783318068207,hh-6,"Given the complexities associated with understanding NGS test results and acting on them, academic and community molecular tumor boards (MTBs) have been developed to implement multidisciplinary expertise (see Chapter 6) . NGS test results may identify FDA-approved therapies, guide clinical trial recommendations or prompt consideration of expanded access to investigational agents or off-label use of therapies approved for other indications . Many clinical trials now include molecular testing to assign treatments to patients based on the molecular profiles of their tumors . These include a pathway for the approval of NGS tests for tumor profiling that involves third-party reviewers of in vitro diagnostics; the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) is the first third-party reviewer to work with the FDA in this way . The FDA recognizes three levels of biomarkers and has commented on the analytic and clinical evidence necessary to support NGS tests for these biomarkers (Figure 4.1) . For approval of the test, there should be evidence of its analytic validity for each specific biomarker and a clinical study that establishes either the link between the result of that test and patient outcomes or clinical concordance with a previously approved companion diagnostic . An additional 27% of patients carry genomic abnormalities with convincing clinical evidence supporting the use of these alterations as predictive biomarkers for response to treatment outside of a therapy's registered indication . FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx) is an NGS-based in vitro diagnostic device for the detection of substitutions, indels and CNVs in 324 genes, selected gene rearrangements and genomic signatures, including MSI and TMB . A Phase II oncology study would be designed to answer the question: does a particular treatment at a selected dose in a particular tumor type (from histology) improve clinical outcome (response to treatment, PFS or overall survival)? A basket trial tests a single treatment and a single biomarker (mutation X in Figure 4.2) in patients with different histologies . The TAPUR Study is a non-randomized clinical trial that aims to identify the performance (both safety and efficacy) of FDA-approved targeted anticancer drugs used for the treatment of advanced disease that potentially has actionable genomic alterations . The study provides FDA-approved targeted therapies contributed by collaborating pharmaceutical companies, catalogs the choice of genomic profiling tests by clinical oncologists and aims to identify the potential signals of drug activity . SPECTA is a collaborative European platform that supports the delivery of high-quality molecular and pathological screening across multiple cancer types to aid patient selection for clinical trials . DRUP, the Drug Rediscovery Protocol launched in the Netherlands in 2016, is trialing FDA- and/or EMA-approved targeted therapies in patients with potentially actionable variants in a tumor type (advanced or metastatic solid tumor, multiple myeloma or B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma) outside of the therapy's approved indication . The use of personalized medicine is potentially a cost-effective choice in cancer patients if a molecular selection can identify which patients will achieve partial, complete or durable responses to a particular treatment .","Precision medicine in oncology matches an individual patient to the correct treatment, based on the biological and molecular features of the patient's cancer. The FDA recognizes a pathway of three levels of biomarkers, based on the clinical evidence necessary to support NGS tests. Multidisciplinary MTBs, comprising various medical disciplines, facilitate the incorporation of molecular diagnostics and interpretation of results into therapeutic decision-making for a patient with cancer. A basket trial is a biomarker-driven study in which a single treatment and single biomarker are tested in patients with different histologies. An umbrella trial is a biomarker-driven study in which participants with a single histology and multiple biomarkers are each matched to a particular treatment."
9781910797310,chp7,"Brain metastases (BM) are common in the natural history of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, with advances in imaging modalities and improvements in systemic disease control, both the incidence and prevalence of BM are rising . Survival ranges from 3 to 14.8 months, depending on the lung diagnosis-specific graded prognostic assessment (DS-GPA): age, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), presence of extracranial metastases (ECM) and number of BM (Table 7.1) . Radiation therapy, surgery and systemic therapies are options for the management of metastatic lesions in the brain . In small randomized trials in patients with a single metastatic brain lesion, surgery plus whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) increased survival compared with WBRT alone . No randomized trials have addressed the role of surgery for multiple lesions, and retrospective data are conflicting . Whole brain radiation therapy continues to be the standard of care for patients with a poor prognosis according to the DS-GPA (id est patients who are not candidates for surgery or SRS) with multiple (more than 3-5) BM . WBRT does not increase survival or quality of life compared with best supportive care (BSC), as reported in the large prospective randomized Quartz trial . In a large randomized trial (RTOG 9508), an SRS boost increased survival in patients with a good prognostic score and a single lesion . Although no randomized trials have directly compared surgery to SRS, SRS seems to provide a similar local control rate (80-90%), especially when SRS is combined with WBRT . In a large trial conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 22952-26001), the addition of WBRT significantly decreased local relapse (at the initial site and within the brain) but there was no significant difference in overall survival . The application of WBRT after SRS (or surgery) may have a negative effect on cognitive function . Thus, SRS is now generally performed without WBRT in patients with a limited number of lesions (up to 3) . SRS without WBRT is feasible as the initial treatment for patients with 5-10 BM . Several prospective trials have demonstrated the activity of first-line chemotherapy for NSCLC metastases, with responses rates of 23-50% for platinum-based regimens . Concurrent WBRT and chemotherapy resulted in higher neurocognitive deficit without clear benefit in response rate or survival . European Society Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines and data from randomized trials support chemotherapy as a reasonable first-line treatment option for patients with stage IV NSCLC and asymptomatic BM . Concurrent erlotinib and WBRT has demonstrated a good overall response rate (86%) with a median overall survival of 12 months . In the randomized RTOG 0302 trial, which addressed the use of erlotinib (or temozolomide or no systemic treatment) with WBRT and SRS, toxicity was higher with systemic therapies than with WBRT/SRS alone . Patients with BM from ALK -rearranged NSCLC who are treated with radiotherapy (SRS and/or WBRT) and crizotinib may have prolonged survival . It is therefore reasonable to propose the use of targeted molecular compounds as first-line treatment for selected patients with stage IV NSCLC and asymptomatic BM .","Brain metastases (BM) are common in the natural history of patients with NSCLC. The Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment (DS-GPA) score, which is based on age, Karnofsky performance score, the presence of extracranial metastases and the number of BM, can guide clinicians' decisions. Surgical resection may be required for patients presenting with neurological symptoms or a large single lesion. Whole brain radiotherapy was the standard treatment for patients with a poor prognosis, but this has recently been challenged. Stereotactic radiosurgery could be given to patients with a limited number of small well-defined BM, as it provides excellent local control with limited toxicities. Systemic treatment (chemotherapy or targeted compounds) is a reasonable treatment option for asymptomatic patients."
9781908541086,ch_5,"Family studies indicate that first-degree relatives of patients with anorexia have an increased prevalence of eating disorders (Table 3.1), and that first-degree relatives of patients with bulimia or binge-eating disorder appear to be at increased risk of eating disorders, mood disorders and substance abuse . Being overweight or obese (with a high BMI) is a risk factor because of the likelihood of dieting, while low BMI may characterize individuals who are already prodromally ill with anorexia but who have not yet reached the weight criteria for definitive diagnosis . In addition, because energy requirements for weight rehabilitation and maintenance have been shown to differ in anorexic patients, bulimic patients and control populations, it is possible that premorbid metabolic abnormalities act as risk factors for eating disorders . Furthermore, families of individuals with anorexia tend to have a higher rate of parental eating disorders, family dieting and adverse comments from family members about eating, weight or appearance . Mounting evidence implicates the mass media in the promotion of body-image and eating disturbances, with the emphasis on dieting and other weight-control behaviors often targeted at women rather than men, thus paralleling the gender distribution of eating pathology . Societal influences and internalization of the thin ideal may lead directly to body dissatisfaction and unhealthy eating, or may be mediated by more general psychological processes such as intrapersonal (self-esteem, mood, personality) or interpersonal functioning and/or emotional regulation and coping . In some studies, a high incidence of sexual abuse during childhood is reported by women with diagnosed eating disorders; rates of abuse are seemingly higher in bulimia than anorexia . In a US statewide representative sample, both sexual and physical abuse were strong independent risk factors for disordered eating in adolescent girls and boys . The demographics of early feeding problems suggest no association, because boys are more likely to exhibit disordered eating in early childhood, whereas girls are at greater risk in adolescence . However, longitudinal studies in other fields indicate that premorbid anxiety disorders and negative affectivity are also risk factors for the development of other psychiatric conditions such as affective disorders and substance abuse . Body-image disturbance is a well-known risk factor for clinical and subclinical levels of eating disorders . The unhealthy weight-control behaviors that characterize eating disorders, such as strict dieting, excessive exercise or laxative/diuretic abuse, are used to compensate for negative perceptions of body size, shape or weight . Psychological risk factors associated with bulimia include negative self-evaluation, shyness, a lack of close friends, missing school, perfectionism and mood lability . Pressure to be thin from friends or weight-based teasing from peers has been associated with subclinical eating disturbances in high-school girls and with full-blown eating disorders in college-age women . Negative social feedback, in the form of teasing a person about their appearance, has been indicated as a possible etiologic factor in the development of disordered eating . Psychological factors include the hypothesis of an addictive personality that predisposes individuals to becoming addicted to substances, viewing food and drugs as functional equivalents .","Clinicians and patients are best served by considering eating disorders from a bio-psycho-social perspective, unified in a framework of developmental psychopathology. All components are present, and interact to increase the risk for disorder as development proceeds. Disorder represents the crystallization of these interactions into syndromes which, in this case, are a developmental outcome, not simply the burgeoning of a latent biological deficit, as reductionist models of psychopathology would have it. Eating problems usually emerge in the context of pubertal change. Parental attitudes and behaviors towards eating, weight and body shape have a strong influence on the development of a child's relationship with food and body image, both healthy and unhealthy. Stressors and life events, such as childhood abuse, separations or bereavement, may precipitate the onset of eating disorders. Psychiatric comorbidities in both men and women with eating disorders include depression, anxiety, obsessive behavior and body-image disturbance. When treating a patient with either an eating disorder or substance-abuse problem, clinicians should always consider the possibility of comorbidity."
9781908541796,chapter8,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of normal B cells will lead to a sustained lymphoproliferation unless controlled by CD8+ T cells . Not surprisingly, therefore, when the controlling T cells are suppressed, either by an immunosuppressive agent such as ciclosporin (cyclosporine) or some other form of T-cell depletion, there can be a resurgence of EBV-infected B cells . In practice, the malignant potential of such lymphoproliferations (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders [PTLDs]) is variable; some cases are clinically aggressive, however, and may be thought of as a form of high-grade lymphoma . The incidence of PTLDs following solid-organ or bone-marrow transplantation depends on a number of factors including the depth of immunosuppression achieved . EBV-positive PTLDs are most common within the first year of transplantation (especially in EBV-negative patients with an EBV-positive donor), whereas EBV-negative disease peaks at 10 years . Overall, approximately 60% of PTLD cases are EBV-positive . Usually, both early and polymorphic disease occur soon after a transplant and are EBV-positive . There are several subtypes of monomorphic disease such as diffuse large B-cell type, Burkitt type and Hodgkin type . The tumor may arise in donor- or recipient-derived B cells, though recipient-derived PTLDs are much more common . Clinical presentation of PTLD is highly variable . The common extranodal presentation of this condition means that any organ of the body may be affected including the central nervous system (CNS) . Cellular therapy with EBV-specific T cells is being explored in clinical trials and appears effective even in some very resistant cases . HIV-associated lymphoma . The association of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with HIV-1 has been known since 1985 . There are several well-recognized ways in which HIV-associated lymphomas present . The most common presentation is systemic lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Burkitt type . Extranodal disease is more common than in HIV-negative patients . As with other forms of HIV-associated lymphoma, EBV positivity is a frequent finding . Clearly, with better HIV treatment the incidence of this form of HIV-associated lymphoma is diminishing . These lymphomas are aggressive and present in the late stages of HIV infection, causing the accumulation of ascites and pericardial and pleural effusions . Plasmablastic lymphoma occurs almost exclusively in patients with HIV, and presents with lesions affecting the jaw and oral mucosa, although other extranodal sites may be involved . They are CD20−, extremely aggressive and the majority of patients will die of their lymphoma despite intensive chemotherapy . Treatment of HIV-associated lymphoma is directed by its pathological subtype . These patients are at risk of CNS involvement and will receive intrathecal or high-dose methotrexate/cytarabine . Particularly in patients in whom the HIV infection is well controlled, however, rituximab is generally considered to be important . The International Prognostic Index applies to HIV-associated lymphomas; in addition, a low CD4 count confers a poorer prognosis . Treatment of relapsed HIV-associated lymphomas is difficult . These patients frequently do not tolerate high-dose therapy well and its use may therefore be confined to those with better-controlled HIV disease .","Immunosuppression is a major risk factor for the development of B-cell lymphoma. Viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (associated with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) and human herpes virus 8 (associated with primary effusion lymphoma) are often implicated. Treatment should target the lymphoma and the cause of the immunosuppression (id est highly active antiretroviral therapy in lymphomas associated with HIV and a reduction in therapeutic immunosuppression in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder). Improved HIV treatment is leading to a falling incidence of HIV-associated lymphoma. The use of rituximab in HIV-associated B-cell lymphomas is generally considered standard in those with well-controlled infection."
9783318067095,ch4,"As more digital tools are deployed in health research and care settings, new questions emerge about how to use them responsibly and ethically . Anyone developing and/or testing a digital tool for use in disease prevention and treatment within the USA should be aware of the regulatory requirement to obtain institutional review board (IRB) approval prospectively when involving people as research participants . Published in 1979, the Belmont Report describes three guiding principles of ethical biomedical and behavioral research: respect for persons, beneficence and justice . As cybersecurity concerns increased with research involving information and communication technologies (ICT), the Department of Homeland Security developed the Menlo Report . Informed by guiding ethical principles, a federal policy for the protection of human subjects was published in 1991 and adopted by 15 federal agencies and institutes . The regulations speak to basic protections for human research participants in subpart A, known as the Common Rule . The three core principles of biomedical ethics described in the Belmont Report are at the core of research ethics and should be carefully considered during the study design phase and ethics review process . How this information is conveyed is important because volunteering to be a research participant is different from, say, accepting terms of service (ToS) to access an app, or signing a consent form to obtain medical care . Consent to participate in research is a choice that an individual can only make if presented with information in a setting conducive to good decision-making . The informed consent process involves more than signing a form to document voluntary participation - it is the first of what may be many interactions between a participant and the research team and is part of developing a trusted relationship . For informed consent to be meaningful, participants will need to be 'tech-literate' enough to understand the specifics of how their data will be obtained and used . A participant may also think that if the study team has access to their health data in real time, 24/7, then that means someone is paying attention to them (which may not be the case) . For instance, if a technology collects and then transmits a study participant's location data to a publicly accessible or non-secure website, the likelihood of a loss of privacy is 100% for all users - yet the consequences will vary . Safeguarding data and managing data-sharing protocols are important considerations when applying the principle of beneficence, and researchers, IRBs and research participants need to think about carefully these . Other factors specific to risk assessment include the type of potential harm (exempli gratia physical, psychological, economic, social) as well as the duration and severity of harm to research participants . Within the domain of beneficence is the need for the digital measurement tools to be valid and reliable (see chapter 9) . For example, in a study designed to increase physical activity in refugee women, the researcher decided to use a wrist-worn accelerometer to assess daily movement .","The principles that guide the ethical conduct of biomedical and behavioral research include: respect for persons, beneficence, justice (Belmont Report) and respect for law and public interest (Menlo Report). Knowing how to apply ethical principles is a responsibility of all stakeholders involved in digital health research, including technologists, researchers and ethics review boards."
9781910797631,chp1,"The humoral theories persisted as the dominant explanation of mood (and other) disorders until the 19th century, when use of the term 'depression' in medical works became increasingly common, and an emphasis on its features and the categorization of symptoms enabled the construction of the modern disorder of depression . The view that depression is largely a medicalization of normal sadness has been strongly voiced in both popular and academic texts, and considerable impetus to this critique of clinical practice has been derived from massive increases in the prescribing of antidepressant drugs in the USA, UK and elsewhere over the past two decades . There is evidence that maternal depression can have a negative effect on children - who may show deficits in social, cognitive and psychological functioning, and appear to have heightened vulnerability for depression and other mental health problems in later life . However, we have seen increases in the public awareness of this disorder, the number of people seeking treatment, the volume of prescriptions for antidepressant medications and the perception of healthcare professionals, as shown by the growth in the scientific literature on this topic . concerns about increases in suicide rates - particularly among younger people in industrialized countries in the 1980s and 1990s . The concept of depression poses considerable challenges for clinicians and the public: the diagnosis may be legitimately used across a wide array of presentations, yet diagnosing a person with depression may not necessarily help them or their family or carers to identify the best way of approaching their problems . Considerable work has been done over the past two decades to challenge negative stereotypes and help overcome this stigma, with concerted public health campaigns to inform the community about depression, improve understanding of the disorder and encourage people to seek help . Research indicates that 30-50% of depression cases are missed in primary care, and it appears that recognition problems are amplified by the presence of comorbid medical conditions, which complicate the help-seeking and assessment processes . Depression that does not meet the full criteria for a formal diagnosis is increasingly recognized to cause considerable suffering and places a significant burden on the healthcare system; it is also related to increased mortality and is a risk factor for future major depression . Developing useful approaches to understand and assist people who experience depressive symptoms across the spectrum of presentations remains a central goal . Consensus and clinical evidence is strongest for the more severe forms of depression, but important questions remain about the best ways of understanding and helping the many people who are affected by milder mood problems and how to provide efficient and robust evidence-based support that does not simplistically medicalize life's problems . Despite significant progress, obstacles to treatment delivery remain - in many settings there are shortages of professionals trained in the delivery of evidence-based psychological treatments, and in many countries effective depression management is impeded by problems in the structures or funding arrangements of health services .","Depression has been evident as a problem for individuals and societies since antiquity, but public and professional awareness has markedly increased over the past half-century. Although much progress has been made in clarifying the clinical features and distribution of depression within populations, significant debate remains and there are ongoing difficulties about how to best understand and manage depression, particularly in its milder forms. Improved knowledge about the features, course and management of depression has enabled more prompt recognition, evidence-based treatment decisions and improved outcomes. However, depression is still both under- and over-diagnosed, and therapies are not always targeted appropriately: many depressed people do not receive treatment that could help them whilst prescribing for patients with mild or uncertain symptoms remains evident."
9781912776696,hh-6,"The false positive occurs when the null hypothesis is true (id est there is no treatment difference) but the data give a significant p -value and a treatment difference is falsely declared . The false negative occurs when the alternative hypothesis is true (id est there is a treatment difference) but the data give a non-significant p -value and the difference between treatments is not detected . The probability of the type I error (false positive) is controlled generally at 5%, as determined by the level at which differences are declared statistically significant . In a Phase III pivotal study, however, it must be remembered that 80% power means 20% type II error - a 20% potential to end up with a negative study that fails to detect statistical significance even if a true treatment effect exists . From these data, if the true treatment difference is 0.50 mmol/L, the trial has a power of 62.3% (see Table 3.1) . This means that if the trial was run on 100 occasions and 0.50 mmol/L was the true treatment difference, then a statistically significant p -value (p < 0.05) would be achieved for 62 of those trials, while 38 of the trials would have a non-significant p -value and fail to detect differences; this is the type II error, equal to 37.7% in this case . Table 3.2 provides the values for power at the same specified levels of effect as in Table 3.1 after doubling the sample size to 100 patients per treatment group . A level of effect of interest is specified and the sample size required to give, say, 90% power is then calculated . If 5% of patients are expected to be non-evaluable for the primary analysis, then the required sample size would be increased by 5% to account for these non-evaluable patients without compromising the power . If it has not, and perhaps has simply omitted those patients from the analysis, then some adjustment will need to be made for the assumed control group response rate in the sample size calculation . Many oncology studies with a time-to-event primary endpoint are therefore event driven and the trial data are analyzed when the required number of events are observed in the two treatment groups combined . Calculating the sample size for a trial based on a time-to-event endpoint has an intermediate step as a consequence . If the proportion of patients who experience the event is lower than expected, the study may need to be extended to allow more time for the events to occur or to increase the sample size to achieve the required number of events in an acceptable timeframe . Undertaking a sample size re-evaluation based on blinded data is acceptable from a statistical perspective and does not cause any inflation in the false-positive potential for the trial (type I error) . It is possible to re-evaluate a sample size on the basis of unblinded data, perhaps having observed a smaller than expected treatment difference, but this would constitute an adaptive design and would affect the way in which the data could be analyzed in order to preserve the overall type I error for the comparison .","Every trial has the potential to yield a false-positive or a false-negative result - the false positive is known as the type I error and the false negative the type II error. Potential for the false positive is controlled at 5%, the significance level, while the false negative is controlled via the power. Power is equal to 100% − type II error. The type II error is the false negative, missing a real difference, while the power is the true positive, capturing a real difference. Power can be calculated at the planning stage, in advance of running the trial, by making various assumptions about, in particular, the magnitude of the treatment effect. The sample size calculation is based on the requirement to detect a prespecified treatment difference, often referred to as the clinically relevant difference, with a certain level of power, usually 80%, or at least 90% in a Phase III pivotal trial. As many oncology studies are powered on a primary time-to-event endpoint - power being determined by the number of patients with events - many oncology studies are event driven, with the statistical analysis taking place once the required number of patients with events have been reported. It is possible to increase the sample size if the event rate is lower than anticipated - if this is done in a blinded way, there is no statistical penalty or implication for the statistical method to be used for analysis."
9783318066685,ch1,"Monogenic mutations result in rare inherited diseases such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, certain muscular dystrophies, Tay-Sachs disease, fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease . The elucidation of the molecular basis of inherited diseases, from the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 to the sequencing of the human genome in 2002, has perhaps heralded a new age of genetic medicine, wherein it is now possible for the modern investigator or clinician to target the underlying disease mechanism . Gene-based therapy involves: (1) the addition or modification and subsequent expression of a new gene to provide a specific additional function to a cell; (2) the inoculation of nucleic acids for vaccination against foreign antigens; or (3) the general transfer of nucleic acids to modify the function of an endogenous gene to effect a direct or indirect clinical benefit . While the use of exogenous DNA to replace defective DNA was proposed as early as 1970 by Rogers and 1972 by Friedmann and Roblin, other notable achievements in the field include the development of plasmids as delivery tools for exogenous genes by Cohen and Boyer in 1972 and the construction and use of retroviruses as vectors to effect plasmid delivery to cells by Mulligan in 1984, with subsequent translation to clinics in the later 1980s . Early gene therapy trials, such as those performed by Cline in 1980, were conducted without the approval of ethics committees, and questions were raised regarding the efficacy of gene transfer . Other approved clinical trials at the turn of the millennium included an additional trial for ADA-SCID utilizing hematopoietic stem cells as a vector to effect gene therapy by Bordignon in 1992 and a trial for glioblastoma using antisense RNA by Trojan in 1993 . The administration of an adenovirus-mediated therapy for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency led to the unfortunate death of a patient because of an immune response, resulting in the suspension of clinical trials pending reformulation and codification of procedural and ethical protocols in western countries . The second decade of the millennium saw the approval of several gene therapy products and clinical trials by national regulatory agencies . Progress in different fields of molecular medicine has allowed the modern investigator to propose therapeutic strategies for various genetic diseases . Another genetic therapy approach for targeting cancer cells involves using competent and specific viruses to attack tumor cells, but not healthy cells, lysing the tumor cells as part of the viral life cycle . Clinical gene therapy can be classified based on the mechanism by which the therapeutic agent ameliorates disease symptoms . The delivery of genetic material (achieved by packaging the gene of interest in a vector) results in the transcription and translation of a desired gene product . Early gene therapy trials involved the transduction of immune cells or hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo, followed by reintroduction of modified cells to effect a biological response . Subsequent to the characterization of the disease in model systems and the selection and development of a gene therapy strategy, the next objective involves delivering the gene therapy agent to the affected tissue .","Gene therapy involves the addition of nucleic acid-based products to a cell, either to compensate for a pathogenic loss of a protein or suppress the expression of a toxic protein. The transfer of genetic material may be transient or permanent, with non-viral and viral vectors, and it can be executed in an ex vivo context or directly in vivo. Clinical translation of a gene therapy agent has many hurdles to overcome. These range from identifying the target gene and designing the drug for efficient specific delivery of the required levels of expression to considering the genotoxic and immunologic risks. Monogenic diseases lend themselves to treatment using gene therapies. Ex vivo manipulation of hematopoietic stem cells is paving the way to clinical approvals."
9781908541406,ch_14,"In acute DIC, the consumption of clotting factors and platelets in the diffusely distributed thrombi may lead to a hemorrhagic diathesis and clinical bleeding . The paradoxical combination of bleeding and thrombosis in a hypotensive patient with sepsis, cancer or obstetric accident should raise suspicion of the syndrome, which is confirmed by examination of the blood film and coagulation studies . For example, the sudden appearance of wound bleeding in a patient receiving an intraoperative blood transfusion may suggest an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction and DIC . On occasion, acute DIC that initially presents with bleeding evolves into chronic DIC in which thrombosis predominates . The consequence of this extensive exposure to tissue factor is a profound activation of coagulation and the generation of large amounts of thrombin (see Chapter 1) . Thrombin activates factor (F)V and FVIII, and converts fibrinogen to fibrin, resulting in the depletion of these proteins and accounting for the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) typical of acute DIC . Following binding to thrombomodulin, thrombin activates the anticoagulant protein C, which also becomes depleted, predisposing to microvascular thrombosis . However, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is increased by the inflammatory reaction out of proportion to the levels of tPA, suppressing fibrinolysis, contributing to the thrombosis of small and midsize vessels . In addition, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (exempli gratia interleukin [IL]-1 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]alpha), which are synthesized by activated monocytes, explain the fever, tachycardia and other systemic symptoms of DIC . In chronic DIC, the rate of enhanced production of some clotting factors is greater than their rate of consumption and this may result in elevated concentrations of fibrinogen and FVIII . The raised levels of fibrinogen and FVIII and ongoing consumption of clotting factor inhibitors and components of the fibrinolytic system (plasminogen and tPA), shifts the hemostatic balance toward thrombosis . A scoring system for the diagnosis of overt DIC has been developed by the DIC Subcommittee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), and is shown in Table 12.2; there is a second scoring system for non-overt DIC that includes measurements of antithrombin and protein C, as well as molecular markers of coagulation activation . Patients with acute DIC may have profound bleeding, usually because of hypofibrinogenemia . Persistent oozing may be due to severe thrombocytopenia, as well as platelet dysfunction resulting from elevated levels of fibrin-degradation products . Prolongation of the aPTT and PT is usually caused by low fibrinogen concentrations and decreased levels of FV and FVIII, and can be corrected by administering cryoprecipitate, which is rich in fibrinogen and FVIII . DIC results from activation of coagulation so there has been considerable interest in examining whether anticoagulants might be beneficial . Initial experience with heparin in patients with acute DIC was disastrous; bleeding was accentuated and mortality increased . The dose should be titrated against the clinical response and laboratory measurement of the fibrinogen level and platelet count . Another approach to controlling chronic DIC is through the use of thrombomodulin, a protein that activates protein C and binds and inactivates thrombin .","Persistent oozing from venepuncture sites in a septic patient, or massive vaginal bleeding in an obstetric patient, suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A DIC score >= 5 is indicative of overt DIC. Hypofibrinogenemia usually indicates acute DIC, but the fibrinogen level is often normal or elevated in chronic DIC and it is not a reliable marker of the condition. Treatment is directed toward the underlying cause of DIC; bleeding is controlled with cryoprecipitate and platelet infusions."
9781908541703,ch_2,"Although mortality has declined in most areas since 1990, breast cancer remains the leading cause of death among women aged 35-55 years . Women who work night shifts appear to have an increased risk of developing breast cancer . New technologies have allowed detailed comparisons to be made between the chromosome patterns of 'normal' populations and those at high risk, which meant, initially, women with very strong family histories . The breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 (17q21) and BRCA2 (13q14) are associated with a high risk of breast cancer, even in the absence of a family history . Mutations in these genes are implicated in approximately 4% of all breast cancers and in up to 25% of patients diagnosed before the age of 40 years; they are also linked to ovarian cancers . The breast cancer risk associated with mutations in BRCA2 appears to be less than that with mutations in BRCA1, but the presence of the gene mutation carries additional smaller risks of male breast and prostate cancers and perhaps others . Data from studies in twins suggest that the mutated genes exert their influence very early, and set the context for the development of breast cancer in response to a hormonal stimulus that might otherwise be benign . In addition to genes, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms (non-structural but inheritable changes to the cellular genome that affect gene expression) can significantly influence breast cancer risk . The risk of breast cancer is increased in women from higher socioeconomic classes and living in urban areas . The risk of breast cancer is increased in women who begin to menstruate at an early age (< 12 years) or who undergo the menopause at a relatively advanced age (> 55 years) . Age at first full-term pregnancy appears to be the most important factor influencing hormonal status and thereby reducing the risk of breast cancer . However, a large meta-analysis of 53 studies and 83 000 women in 16 countries found no increased risk of breast cancer in women who had had an abortion, largely refuting this hypothesis . It is now accepted that prolonged lactation is independently associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (by about 4% per year of breast-feeding) . Obesity confers an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women . However, a meta-analysis of cohort studies involving over 330 000 women found no evidence for an association between the relative risk of breast cancer and dietary fat intake . Folate supplements may reduce the risk of breast cancer; however, the Women's Health Initiative observational study found that, contrary to the findings of previous studies, folate did not attenuate the increased risk from alcohol consumption . A meta-analysis involving over 150 000 women examined the influence of oral contraceptive use on the risk of breast cancer . The slight increase in risk associated with oral contraceptives should, however, be viewed in the context of women's health in general . Several large observational studies have clearly shown that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) increases the risk of developing breast cancer .","Age is the greatest risk factor. Mutations in the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 denote high risk but account for only a small proportion of cancers. Mutations in several other genes, including CHEK2, TP53 and EMSY, are also involved. Hormonal factors, such as menstrual and obstetric history and exogenous hormones affect the risk of breast cancer. Diet, exercise, alcohol and smoking are modifiable risk factors. It is arguable whether the use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, early childbearing and long-term breast-feeding are modifiable in a modern society. Mammographic breast density is an independent and powerful risk factor that is not yet fully explained."
9781910797211,ch01,"The Parkinson's journey may begin long before diagnosis, as Parkinson's disease is now recognized to have a prodromal period dominated by a number of non-motor symptoms . This prodromal period could last up to 20 years before awareness of the motor symptoms that mark the initial or 'stable' period of the condition . While the cardinal motor symptoms and signs of rest tremor, akinesia and rigidity remain the mainstay of diagnosis, the prodrome of non-motor symptoms described above develops in the majority of patients . At least half of all patients experience mood disturbance with anxiety or depression at some stage of the illness, including in the prodromal phase . Patients are often fearful and may come to the clinician with preconceptions based on information overload from the internet, or a limited understanding or experience of the disease from the media or a relative . Satisfaction with the initial explanation of the diagnosis has been shown to continue to have an independent effect on quality of life even much later in the illness . There are many effective symptomatic therapies that can help maintain quality of life for the majority of the illness . Regardless of the stage of the disease, non-motor symptoms, in particular depression or mood disturbance, dominate as the predictor of quality of life . It is useful to guide the patient to a viewpoint whereby the focus is maintaining quality of life, rather than defining themselves by their Parkinson's disease, and it is therefore important to address both non-motor and motor symptoms, and to treat both social and motor disability . Early-stage stable Parkinson's disease . In early Parkinson's disease, motor and non-motor symptoms can be controlled in a stable fashion with relatively simple medication regimens . There is also increasing evidence for the benefits of exercise or physical therapy, even in early or mild Parkinson's disease . In most patients, the early stable period of disease eventually develops into an unstable mid stage, which remains poorly defined . It is usually the start of unpredictable responses to oral dopaminergic drugs, with the benefit of short-acting drugs (usually levodopa) wearing off from one dose to the next, necessitating incremental treatment over a period of months or years . Patients experience some balance issues, fear of falling, early morning off periods and dyskinesias . Common non-motor fluctuations are off-period anxiety, depression or fogginess of thought . The multidisciplinary team has a crucial role during this period to reassure the patient and carer, re-evaluate motor and non-motor symptoms and ensure that appropriate appointments for physiotherapy and speech and language therapy are made . Unpredictable motor fluctuations are especially disabling, as patients begin to lose confidence in their ability to go out, resulting in increasing social isolation . In some patients, the final stages of Parkinson's disease may involve the development and delivery of palliative care . It is important that people with Parkinson's disease continue to experience care from a specialist, who can best help navigate the route between over- and under-treatment .","Patients may experience unexplained symptoms for years before diagnosis: prodromal non-motor symptoms, such as impaired sense of smell, constipation and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, develop in the majority of patients. Care must be taken in delivering the diagnosis. It is best if the patient is accompanied by a spouse, partner or other family member, and information may need to be repeated 2-3 weeks later when the shock has subsided. It is important to address both non-motor and motor symptoms, and to treat both social and motor disability. Early treatment is important; quality of life deteriorates in those who delay treatment. Maintaining an active lifetyle, both physically and mentally, is important. All patients will eventually experience motor (and often non-motor) fluctuations, with a 'wearing off' of the benefit of their initial medication. Patients should be reassured that the increasing motor disability and complications of late-stage Parkinson's disease do not tend to occur until the eighth or ninth decade of life; not all patients will reach this stage of Parkinson's disease."
9781910797426,ch09,"The pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis varies slightly according to the etiology and, once initiated, the disease follows a relentless course . The prevalence of chronic pancreatitis varies enormously, from 20 to 200 per 100 000 in the general population, and is increasing as a result of environmental factors, in particular the rising consumption of alcohol and tobacco smoking, which are both regarded as independent risk factors . About 50% of patients develop pancreatic exocrine and endocrine deficiency some 20 years after disease onset, and about 80% experience pain . Both chronic pancreatitis and AIP have a variable clinical course, which includes focal masses, strictures of the pancreatic and/or bile duct with subsequent obstruction and dilation (leading to jaundice), and chronic/recurrent pain and weight loss . peptic ulcer due to loss of bicarbonate secretion (normally produced by the pancreatic ductal cells), and thus loss of buffering capacity against gastric acid arriving in the duodenum from the stomach . The pain of chronic pancreatitis is multifactorial in origin, but modern theories principally relate to nerve alterations (Figure 9.2) . Pain may be increased as a consequence of local complications such as pseudocysts and biliary tract or duodenal obstruction . Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a highly sensitive test for chronic pancreatitis in moderate to severe form (Figure 9.3); a normal EUS correlates well with the absence of chronic pancreatitis . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may reveal abnormalities in the biliary and pancreatic ducts, such as strictures, dilation and pseudocysts (Figure 9.5) . Elimination of environmental risk factors such as alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking may modify symptoms and, to some extent, the long-term outcome . Relieving main pancreatic duct obstruction caused by stones and/or strictures requires the use of stents (placed during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, but is only applicable to simple strictures and single duct stones . There may be little effect on pain and the techniques do not influence the development of pancreatic insufficiency . There is little effect on pain in patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis . The indications for surgical internal drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts include . pseudocysts with complex or multiple main pancreatic duct strictures . Biliary stricture occurs in 6% of patients and duodenal obstruction in 1% . Combined obstruction of the pancreatic duct, main bile duct and duodenum requires a resection, or double drainage if this is not possible . Long-term pain relief is achieved in 70-95% of patients, but there is a still a mortality of 1-3% . It is appropriate for a dominant inflammatory mass in the head of the pancreas or small duct disease (Figure 9.10) . Total pancreatectomy with preservation of the duodenum and spleen may be indicated for patients with disabling pain for whom previous partial resection has failed or for those with total endocrine and exocrine pancreatic failure . Complications of chronic pancreatitis include . Many patients lose the support of their friends and family or their employment, especially if the pancreatitis is associated with alcohol consumption . Genetic counseling and intervention in patients with hereditary and idiopathic chronic pancreatitis .","The diagnosis must be clearly established by radiological, endoscopic and/or functional tests. Risk factors such as smoking and alcohol should be discouraged. Medical measures must be optimized. Beside medical treatment, severe pain may need endoscopic or surgical intervention. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, which may develop within the chronic pancreatitis."
9781905832729,ch_6,"The most common cause in men is benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) secondary to hyperplasia and in women, pelvic organ prolapse (POP), with kinking of the urethra . Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) refers to a regional nodular growth of varying combinations of glandular and stromal proliferation that occurs in almost all men who have testes and who live long enough (see Fast Facts: Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) . The term BPE indicates benign prostatic enlargement, usually due to BPH, while BPO indicates benign prostatic obstruction, a common cause of bladder outlet obstruction . It is estimated that 25-50% of men with microscopic and macroscopic BPH (BPE) will develop lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPO . Posterior urethral valves are a congenital cause of bladder outlet obstruction in boys, which, if severe, can lead to hydronephrosis and renal failure . Urethral stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the urethra that causes obstruction to the outflow of urine and may ultimately lead to back pressure on the bladder, ureters and kidneys . Primary bladder neck obstruction is thought to occur as a result of congenital constriction, or failure to open that is not associated with the urethra . These men typically have normal-sized prostate glands, and objective evidence of obstruction is easily obtained on urodynamic examination . The diagnosis may also be made on the grounds of outlet obstruction in the absence of urethral stricture, prostatic enlargement or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) . Secondary bladder neck obstruction may be caused by posterior urethral valves, and results from hypertrophy of the bladder neck muscle in response to increased voiding pressure caused by the urethral abnormality . The most common symptoms associated with bladder outlet obstruction are listed in Table 5.2 . prostatic enlargement and presence/absence of nodularity or induration (digital rectal examination [ Figure 5.1 ] is mandatory in men and has been shown to be a fairly accurate predictor of prostate size but not of the presence of obstruction) . Measurement of urinary flow rate is an extremely useful investigation in patients with voiding dysfunction . The reduced flow rate characteristic of prostatic outlet obstruction is shown in Figure 2.4 . Relatively selective alpha -1 adrenoceptor antagonists ('alpha blockers') have been shown to increase peak urinary flow rates and improve symptoms in 30-45% of men, but they are of little value in patients with complete inability to void . They act by relaxing the prostate and bladder neck smooth muscle, reducing outlet obstruction without adversely affecting detrusor contractility . Surgical treatment of BPH has the best results in terms of improvement in symptoms and urine flow rates, but is associated with a much higher incidence of complications than medical treatment . Transurethral resection of the prostate (Figure 5.2) is the most common surgical treatment for BPH . Transurethral incision of the bladder neck and prostate is used when a patient has obstruction caused by a prostate that is relatively small (generally less than 35 g), with a high bladder neck and no hyperplasia of the middle lobe . Bladder outlet obstruction may occur at any point along the length of the urethra from the bladder neck to the urethral meatus .","Voiding problems occur when normal smooth emptying of the bladder is impeded, through obstruction or impaired detrusor contractility. Benign prostatic enlargement secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a process of normal aging in men, is the most common cause of outlet obstruction. In women, pelvic organ prolapse (POP) can cause obstruction. Rarer causes include posterior urethral valves, urethral stricture and bladder neck obstruction, which may be congenital or secondary to increased voiding pressures as a result of urethral abnormality. Uroflowmetry and urodynamic investigations are useful in the diagnosis of outlet obstruction but are not indicated for all men thought to have BPH. Transurethral ultrasonography and measurement of postvoid residual volume may also provide useful information. Videourodynamic investigations can be helpful in women with POP and suspected obstruction. Obstruction due to BPH can be treated with alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. Surgery (transurethral resection, vaporization or incision of the prostate) may be needed. Surgery is often required for bladder neck obstruction and urethral stricture."
9781910797815,chp8,"A specific approach to the management of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) may be required in certain patient populations, such as women and children, and in particular situations, such as splanchnic vein thrombosis or surgery . Other studies have reported higher rates of splanchnic vein thrombosis (see below) and cerebral vascular thrombosis in women than in men . Importantly, MPNs affect women at any stage of life and hence present specific challenges with respect to contraception, pregnancy and the menopause . Combined oral contraceptives are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, and are not recommended for women with any MPN . Table 8.1 presents the potential complications of pregnancy in women with MPNs . Potential risk factors for thrombosis and other adverse outcomes in pregnancy are listed in Table 8.2 . While there are no validated predictors of outcome in pregnancy, previous thrombosis or hemorrhage and extreme thrombocytosis are considered to be risk factors for adverse outcomes in women with MPN . Although estrogens are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, one retrospective study found that the use of estrogen-based HRT was not associated with an increased risk of major thrombotic events in women with MPN . Based on these limited data, it seems reasonable to recommend HRT at the lowest possible dose (exempli gratia patches or gel), and only in patients with no other risk factors for venous thromboembolism and no history of thrombosis . Phlebotomy is recommended for asymptomatic patients with PV, and low-dose aspirin may be considered for teenagers with PV who have outgrown the risk of Reye's syndrome . Stem cell transplantation has been used in the treatment of pediatric PMF but it should only be used as a last resort in patients with severe disease, because of the possibility of spontaneous resolution and the significant mortality rates associated with the procedure . Splanchnic vein thrombosis (also known as abdominal vein thrombosis) is common in MPNs, occurring in approximately 15% of patients, and may include . MPN may not be readily clinically apparent in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis because abnormal blood cell counts may be masked by concurrent splenomegaly, hemodilution, gastrointestinal bleeding and iron deficiency . In a 2012 meta-analysis, MPN was present in approximately 41% of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome and 32% of those with portal vein thrombosis . All patients should receive anticoagulant therapy (exempli gratia low-molecular-weight heparin), followed by long-term oral anticoagulants to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0-3.0 . Given the risks of thrombosis and bleeding associated with MPN, patients undergoing surgery require careful management; however, data to inform treatment decisions in this setting are limited . Similarly, retrospective studies indicate that surgery is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients with PV (Figure 8.2), but prospective data are lacking . The following recommendations have been made for the management of surgical patients with PV and can be generalized to other MPNs . prophylactic antithrombotic treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin, starting at least 12 hours before surgery; guidelines for specific surgical procedures should guide the use of additional antithrombotic therapy .","Combined oral contraceptives are not recommended for women with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) because of the risk of thrombosis. MPN increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including early fetal loss and pre-eclampsia. Antithrombotic therapy for pregnant women at risk of vascular complications consists of aspirin, possibly with phlebotomy in women with polycythemia vera. Low-molecular-weight heparin and cytoreductive therapy with interferon (IFN)-alpha may be considered in women at high risk of complications. Hormone replacement therapy should only be used in perimenopausal women with no other risk factors for venous thromboembolism or a history of thrombosis. There is currently no risk stratification specifically for children with MPN, although a history of life-threatening venous or arterial thrombosis should be considered high risk, warranting cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea or IFN-alpha) The treatment of splanchnic vein thrombosis requires a multidisciplinary approach. All patients should receive long-term anticoagulant therapy, and patients with thrombocytosis require cytoreductive therapy; some patients may require invasive intervention. There are few data to inform treatment decisions in patients with MPN undergoing elective surgery. Best practice indicates optimizing blood counts and a clear plan for anticoagulants."
9781910797617,chp5,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disorder; the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification (see Table 2.3) classifies the patient's 'risk' according to the molecular pathology (where this is known), which in turn informs the prognosis . Accurate prognostication is important when considering the risk versus benefit associated with different approaches to treatment (chemotherapy, novel targeted therapies, allogeneic hematopoetic cell transplant [alloHCT]), which are associated with different levels of early treatment-related mortality and risk of relapse . Multiple studies have established age as an important and independent adverse risk factor; in particular, older patients (> 60 years) have dismal outcomes with conventional treatment . Table 5.1 summarizes data from a retrospective analysis of the combined adverse effects of older age and poor performance status on mortality risk . This and other studies have also identified a positive correlation between increasing age and adverse cytogenetic and molecular markers, and with increased incidence of multidrug resistance to chemotherapy . Performance status and comorbidities should also be considered alongside age when deciding on the intensity of treatment to offer older patients with AML . Additional parameters such as age, white blood cell count at diagnosis, presence of certain gene mutations and response to induction chemotherapy can influence prognosis, while the type of consolidation therapy could potentially alter the predicted outcomes, as discussed in Chapter 4 . The ELN has recently revised the risk stratification groups for AML on the basis of the genetic abnormalities detected by conventional karyotyping and molecular techniques (see Table 2.4) . Molecular markers can be used within the cytogenetically defined risk groups to further refine the prognostic risk, and may even be useful in deciding the optimal consolidation therapy, as illustrated in the following two scenarios . In the large cohort of patient with cytogenetically normal karyotype, mutation analysis in NPM1 and FLT3 can help distinguish three subsets . NPM1+ / FLT3 -ITD− (without adverse-risk genetic lesions) is associated with good prognosis; consolidation with chemotherapy alone may be considered, as for a cytogenetic favorable-risk group (note that the ELN 2017 update includes FLT3 -ITD with a 'low' mutated to wild-type ratio [< 0.5] in this group) . Within the cytogenetically favorable-risk group, the presence of a KIT mutation is associated with poor prognosis and may therefore identify a subset of favorable-risk patients for whom allogeneic HCT can be considered in CR1 . The identification of novel markers beyond prognostication may also help identify subsets of patients who may benefit from therapies with specific molecular targets . Patients who do not achieve CR after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy are considered to be at high risk for relapse . Despite these challenges, several studies have established the role of MRD in the accurate prognosis of outcomes when performed after induction and consolidation therapy and before alloHCT . Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides a new means for MRD monitoring that can potentially be applied to all cases of AML and may help to accurately identify molecular subclones, with the potential to improve prognostication and treatment by offering novel targeted therapies directed at smaller subclones that may not have been detected by other conventional molecular techniques .","Accurate prognostication is important when considering the risk versus benefit associated with different approaches to treatment. The World Health Organization system classifies patients' 'risk' based on molecular pathology. Age is an important and independent adverse risk factor, and older patients (> 60 years) have particularly dismal outcomes with conventional treatment. Age and certain cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities increase the risk of multidrug resistance to chemotherapy. Understanding of the molecular genetics of acute myeloid leukemia has increased in the last decade, and several mutations, either alone or in combination, have been shown to have a significant bearing on prognosis. European LeukemiaNet includes these genetic abnormalities in its risk stratification. Molecular markers can be used within the cytogenetically defined risk groups to further refine the prognostic risk and may influence the choice of consolidation therapy. The presence of measurable residual disease after induction chemotherapy indicates a high risk of relapse."
9781908541963,chapter9,"Benign liver tumors, cysts, infections and abscesses . The use of ultrasonography in the investigation of abdominal symptoms and abnormal liver function tests has greatly increased the detection of benign liver lesions (Table 9.1), although the lesions identified are often not relevant to the issue under investigation . Because the detection of focal lesions in the liver can precipitate considerable anxiety until they are characterized as benign, appropriate investigations are warranted and occasionally therapeutic intervention is indicated . . The characteristics of the more common benign lesions are summarized in Table 9.2 . Hemangiomas are the most common of all the benign focal lesions and are present in at least 1% of the population . Focal nodular hyperplasia is the most frequent of the benign solid liver tumors and is most commonly encountered in women during their reproductive years . The typical lesion is solitary, measures 3-5 cm in diameter and has a characteristic central scar that may be visualized on scanning . Unlike adenomas, there is no risk of rupture or malignant transformation and these lesions do not need specific therapy . Unlike focal nodular hyperplasia, these lesions have the potential to grow, hemorrhage and rupture . Surgical resection is recommended if an adenoma exceeds 10 cm in diameter; however, this is not an option when the lesions are multiple and distributed throughout both lobes of the liver, a condition referred to as adenomatosis . Most are asymptomatic unless very large or complicated by infection or hemorrhage into the cyst . These cysts can also be complicated by hemorrhage and infection . Pain or jaundice are the most common presenting symptoms, typically in young adults . There are two patterns of abscess: multiple small abscesses distributed throughout the liver, and larger discrete abscesses, which have a predilection for the right lobe . The latter are readily apparent on scanning the liver, but small abscesses may be difficult to detect . Drainage of larger abscesses is achieved percutaneously or surgically and is the mainstay of treatment . Despite effective drainage, protracted periods of antibiotic therapy are required to eradicate the infection . Antibiotics are the only effective therapy for the smaller, diffuse pattern of infection . Abscesses that develop as a complication of cholangitis may be in direct communication with the biliary tree, and effective drainage may be achieved by endoscopic measures taken to address the cause of the underlying biliary obstruction . Discomfort in the right upper quadrant and fever are the main presenting symptoms . The abscess can usually be detected on ultrasonography and is most frequently found in the right lobe . Symptoms, usually subtle, include fever and abdominal pain . Initial management is with mebendazole or albendazole but many cases will require surgical resection . Cholangitis is infection in the biliary tree and is usually associated with an obstruction to bile flow (exempli gratia stone in the common bile duct, benign stricture or malignant disease) . The treatment consists of antibiotic therapy and, if possible, relief of the underlying obstruction via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography .",Benign liver lesions are relatively common. Most lesions identified are unrelated to the symptoms under investigation. Hemangiomas and focal nodular hyperplasia are managed conservatively. Adenomas are closely linked to hormone therapy and require surveillance and occasionally surgical resection.
9781908541963,chapter12,"Many patients with advanced liver disease, however, are not candidates for liver transplantation, in part due to the limited supply of donor organs . Referring physicians should understand the importance of timing the referral for liver transplantation, be familiar with its indications and contraindications and be comfortable with a pretransplantation evaluation . In the USA, the most common indications for transplantation resulting from chronic liver disease are viral hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (Table 12.1) . Severe liver disease that has resulted from acute disorders may also require liver transplantation (Table 12.2) . Acute viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury are common causes . In general, patients with acute liver disease complicated by encephalopathy should be transferred to a liver transplant center for continued observation and preparation for transplant if needed . With regard to chronic liver disease, it is best to select patients for liver transplant whose survival would otherwise be dramatically limited . Thus, the clinician must select patients who are most in need of liver transplant, and are likely to survive the procedure . The Child's score (Table 12.6) predicts survival for patients with advanced cirrhosis . Patients with a score greater than 7 are likely to benefit from consultation at a liver transplant center . The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score predicts survival of patients with cirrhosis using serum bilirubin and creatinine levels and the international normalized ratio (INR) . TABLE 12.6 Determination of Child's score, used to predict the survival of patients with severe cirrhosis . Transplant centers use the MELD score to prioritize patients awaiting liver transplant . Patients with hepatitis C make up a significant proportion of those undergoing liver transplantation, either because of liver failure or complicating hepatocellular carcinoma . Currently, recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is almost universal and about one-third of patients get aggressive liver disease . The antiretrovirals also appear to have reduced the need for liver transplantation in these patients because of liver failure, although hepatocellular carcinoma continues to be a common indication . Survival of patients with ALD following transplantation appears to be comparable to that of transplant patients with non-alcoholic liver disease . It is becoming increasingly likely that medical practitioners will encounter liver transplant recipients on an occasional basis and will need some insight into aspects that differentiate these individuals from their normal patient population . Long-term immunosuppression increases the risk of opportunistic infections and malignant disease (Table 12.7) . Vaccination against influenza is recommended for liver transplant recipients and should reduce the incidence of influenza in these patients . This is the most common non-cutaneous malignant disease after liver transplantation and can present at any time . A typical example is the nephrotoxicity associated with long-term use of calcineurin inhibitors - up to 25% of liver transplant recipients have chronic renal failure 10 years after transplantation . Many liver diseases have the potential to recur after liver transplantation (Table 12.9) . The liver transplant center will normally screen for recurrent disease, but some diseases may first become apparent to the primary care physician (exempli gratia ALD), whereas others may be co-managed in the community (exempli gratia hepatitis C) .","Liver transplantation is effective for a wide range of liver diseases. Thorough assessment is mandatory and must cover physiological, social and psychiatric comorbidity. Many diseases recur after transplantation, but with variable consequences. Careful attention to the complications of immunosuppression is of great importance; possible opportunistic infections, drug interactions and side effects can occur. Limitations to lifestyle after transplantation are remarkably few."
9781910797082,ch03,"Drug-induced rashes are usually characterized by a generalized skin eruption and, less frequently, fever, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia and visceral involvement . Lichen planus is a relatively uncommon inflammatory dermatosis of unknown cause, frequently associated with hepatitis C infection and characterized by small, discrete, flat-topped, mauve pruritic papules that may coalesce into larger patches . Certain clinical forms of lichen planus (exempli gratia palmo-plantar, genital) are difficult to differentiate from psoriasis, especially in darker skin . Diagnosis is usually by clinical examination supported, if necessary, by skin biopsy . However, these neoplasms usually occur singly or are fewer in number, are never symmetrical and do not show the classic silvery scale of psoriasis . If localized psoriasiform lesions fail to respond to traditional topical therapy, this diagnosis should be considered and a skin biopsy performed . Fine atrophy ('cigarette-paper wrinkling') within the lesions, plus a lack of response to traditional antipsoriatic therapy, may be useful in differentiating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma from psoriasis . The onset of pityriasis rosea is typically acute, and the first sign is usually a single large herald patch presenting a few days before the characteristic truncal rash . Tinea, or ringworm, is an infection caused by a dermatophyte fungus and may sometimes be mistaken for psoriasis . Although a minor degree of hair thinning is not uncommon in established cases of psoriasis, well-demarcated areas of hair loss (Figure 3.1) and signs such as the 'black dots' or fractured hair shafts characteristic of tinea infection are highly unusual in psoriasis . In addition, tinea capitis seldom shows the classic silvery scale of psoriasis . Lack of symmetrical lesions, presence of peripheral scale and central clearing are all more characteristic of tinea than of psoriasis . The lesion has a non-silvery, fine scale, particularly at the periphery, and frequently extends more on the left than the right side . Tinea unguium infection of the nails may be extremely difficult to distinguish from psoriatic nail involvement, particularly in toenails . A search for nail pits and clinical evidence of cutaneous psoriasis or tinea of the feet is important . Therefore, it is important to search carefully for a primary syphilitic lesion, together with associated lymphadenopathy, mucosal lesions and palmar-plantar lesions with a peripheral collarette of scale, which are characteristic of secondary syphilis . Individual patches are usually more pruritic, lack a silvery scale and are less likely to show the more vivid, characteristic purplish-red color of psoriasis (Figure 3.3) . Hyperkeratotic forms of eczema, particularly in atopic patients, may be identical in appearance to psoriasis . Clues to the diagnosis include a history of atopy (hay fever and/or asthma), a lack of psoriasis elsewhere on the body, and evidence of eczema elsewhere on the skin . Clinically, psoriasis is usually more clearly demarcated than eczema, even on the palms and soles . In addition, the lack of classic psoriatic nail involvement is important . However, in the initial stage, pompholyx vesicles are clear (in contrast to the yellowish color of pustular psoriasis; see Figure 2.6) and are intensely pruritic .","Various dermatological disorders can resemble psoriasis, including other inflammatory dermatoses, infections and neoplasms. Medical and family history and physical examination, along with laboratory findings, are all important in establishing the correct diagnosis."
9781910797105,ch01,"Descriptions of symptoms associated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia date back to preclassical cultures . In Western cultures, the Renaissance led to a re-emergence of interest in classical thought, with a reawakening of the conceptualization of mental illnesses, including psychoses, as naturalistic disorders . Organic etiologies of mental illness were adopted, and the initial descriptions and classifications of these disorders were attempted . An early diagnostic system emerged and various mental illnesses were described, including epilepsy, melancholia, mania and the dementing psychotic disorders, which included schizophrenia . However, the system lacked a general approach that could integrate the diverse manifestations of mental illness into distinct clinical syndromes . Furthermore, the clinical presentation of an individual could change over time, and patients with the same symptoms could have different outcomes . First, the limitations of cross-sectional descriptions of symptoms for classifying mental disorders led to the emergence of a new system based on unified causes, clinicopathological correlations and the longitudinal course and prognosis of presumed disorders . The other development was the identification of the spirochete as the causal agent in general paralysis of the insane (GPI) (Figure 1.1), a common form of insanity in the 19th century . Its symptom manifestations were diverse and overlapped extensively with the symptomatology of schizophrenia . The identification of GPI as a syphilitic insanity helped Emil Kraepelin (Figure 1.2) to delineate the two other major patterns of insanity: manic-depressive psychosis and dementia praecox (or dementia of the young: schizophrenia), and to group together under the heading of dementia praecox the previously disparate categories of insanity, including hebephrenia, paranoia and catatonia . In differentiating dementia praecox from manic-depressive disorder, Kraepelin emphasized the early onset and what he believed to be the inevitable deteriorating course of dementia praecox, compared with the relatively good outcome of manic-depressive illness . Kraepelin also described what he thought were the two main pathological processes in patients with schizophrenia . The former process corresponds to our current concept of the negative symptoms, and the latter to the positive symptoms, of schizophrenia . In 1911, Eugen Bleuler (Figure 1.3), recognizing that dementia was not a necessary characteristic of dementia praecox, suggested the term 'schizophrenia' (splitting of the mind) for the disorder . Bleuler believed that schizophrenia represented a syndrome consisting of several disorders that shared a common psychopathology . He also introduced the concept of primary and secondary symptoms of schizophrenia . Of these four symptoms, Bleuler viewed as central to the illness the loss of association between thought processes and that between thought, emotion and behavior . Since Kraepelin and Bleuler there have been relatively few modifications of the description of schizophrenia . The diagnostic categories of schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder were introduced in the 20th century, but these categories largely represent refinements in the boundary between schizophrenia and the affective disorders . Currently, schizophrenia has the status of a syndrome, a characteristic collection of symptoms that result from multiple genetic and environmental causal pathways . These manifestations and their long-term course are used to differentiate schizophrenia from other forms of psychosis (see Chapter 2) .",Schizophrenia was first clearly identified in the 1890s. Its characteristic features were an early onset and a chronic course. Kraepelin described two characteristic psychopathological processes. Bleuler introduced the concept of primary and secondary symptoms.
9781908541024,ch_10,"The location of a skull base tumor strongly influences clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and management . MRI is the imaging modality of choice for all skull base neoplasms because it is accurate in providing tumor dimensions and location, as well as in depicting critical vascular structures such as the carotid and vertebrobasilar arteries and branches . The management options for skull base tumors are surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or combinations thereof, or careful observation with close follow-up . For skull base tumors that are benign, and causing minimal symptoms and signs, observation is often recommended because surgical intervention may cause considerable morbidity . Stereotactic radiosurgery is being used increasingly for small tumors, such as schwannomas or small meningiomas, in surgically high-risk areas, with promising results (Figure 9.1) . Pituitary adenomas are the third most common type of primary intracranial tumor (after gliomas and meningiomas), accounting for 10-15% of all such tumors . Patients with MEN-1 have about a 25% risk of developing a pituitary adenoma, usually a macroadenoma that secretes growth hormone (GH) or prolactin . Pituitary adenomas may present clinically with endocrinological or neurological dysfunction, or both . Approximately 70% of pituitary adenomas secrete a hormone, and thus present with an endocrine abnormality . Visual field screening should be obtained at baseline and followed in all patients with tumors of the pituitary region, with the exception of those with very small lesions . Pituitary apoplexy is a rare neurological presentation of a pituitary tumor, in which there is acute development of headache, visual loss, ophthalmoplegia, altered level of consciousness, and cardiovascular collapse secondary to adrenal failure . Medical management with a dopamine agonist (bromocriptine or cabergoline) is successful in normalizing prolactin levels, preserving fertility and decreasing tumor size in 50-100% of patients . However, lifelong therapy is required because most patients will have recurrent symptoms and tumor growth if the dopamine agonist is discontinued . GH-secreting pituitary adenomas are insidious tumors that often present in slightly older patients and are more likely to be a macroadenoma at diagnosis . Nelson syndrome occurs in 10-15% of patients undergoing bilateral adrenalectomy, with persistent or progressive ACTH secretion, enlargement of the sellar lesion, progressive neurological symptoms and secondary skin hyperpigmentation . Although they secrete FSH or luteinizing-stimulating hormone (LSH), most are endocrinologically asymptomatic and present with neurological symptoms related to compression . Surgery is indicated to preserve or restore both neurological and endocrinological function in patients with large or symptomatic tumors . Stereotactic radiotherapy provides excellent control in patients with inoperable or high surgical risk tumors . Radiotherapy can control most tumors when there is recurrence or tumor progression following surgery . Preoperative differentiation between these tumors on the basis of imaging features is difficult, although chordomas are often situated centrally and chondrosarcomas laterally at the skull base . Chondrosarcomas are more surgically accessible than chordomas and also arise in younger patients . Symptoms of skull base tumors arise from involvement of cranial nerves, compression of brainstem or basal cerebral structures, and obstruction of the pharynx, middle ear or nasal cavity .","Symptoms arise from involvement of cranial nerves, compression of brainstem or basal cerebral structures, and obstruction of the pharynx, middle ear or nasal cavity. Surgery can be curative if benign skull base tumors are resected completely. However, there is a relatively high risk of operative morbidity. Radiosurgery is an increasingly accepted alternative to surgery for small tumors in surgically high-risk areas. The goals of therapy for pituitary tumors include: reversal of endocrinopathy; elimination of mass effect with preservation or restoration of neurological function (particularly vision); and prevention of recurrence. Patients with prolactinomas should be managed medically; most other pituitary adenomas require surgery, with or without radiotherapy. Endocrine consultation is critical in the initial assessment and ongoing management of all patients with pituitary region tumors (adenomas, craniopharyngiomas and germ cell tumors). Particle-beam radiation can achieve long-term control of growth for radioresistant skull base tumors such as chordomas and chondrosarcomas."
9781910797426,ch08,"Excessive stimulation of white blood cells, coupled with the release of acute-phase proteins from the liver results in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (Figure 8.2) . Unlike chronic pancreatitis, once the patient has recovered from an attack of acute pancreatitis there may be complete resolution of symptoms and a return to normal anatomy and physiology . The diagnosis is based on a typical clinical presentation (abdominal pain with acute onset of persistent severe epigastric pain radiating to the back), plus a serum lipase (or amylase) that is three times the normal upper limit within 2-3 days of the onset of symptoms . Up to 10% of patients have necrosis of the pancreatic and peripancreatic tissues, which continues for several days, with variable evolution towards persistence or disappearance, remaining sterile or becoming infected . It is important to determine as early as possible (within the first 3 days of symptom onset) whether the attack of pancreatitis is likely to be mild or severe . acute pancreatitis (includes mild acute pancreatitis; no organ failure, no local or systemic complications) . moderately severe acute pancreatitis (transient organ failure, local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure) . severe acute pancreatitis (persistent organ failure over 48 hours) . Computed tomography scanning is used to help establish the diagnosis in uncertain cases and to assist in determining the need for and extent of surgical intervention (pancreatic necrosectomy, colectomy for necrosis, etc . Pancreatitis severity is usually stratified into mild, moderate and severe, based on the extent of inflammatory changes, fluid collections and necrosis seen in CT scans . The Ranson score includes 11 criteria variously applicable at 24 and 48 hours, and separate systems for alcohol- and gallstone-associated acute pancreatitis . Patients with a severe attack have persistent organ failure (over 48 hours from onset) and will need to be managed on an intensive care unit . However, if infected necrosis is suspected (based on failure to improve) or documented (by CT-guided fine needle aspiration), then antibiotics are recommended, followed by necrosectomy if required . ERCP is usually not indicated in mild or moderately severe acute biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis or CBD obstruction . However, in patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis secondary to gallstones, when imaging and biochemical tests highly predict an obstructed CBD (even without cholangitis), ERCP will possibly reduce morbidity and mortality from acute pancreatitis . EUS and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are needed to prove the presence of suspected CBD stones, and will prevent unnecessary ERCP in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis and/or jaundice . Surgical treatment may be required in necrotizing acute pancreatitis if infected necrosis is present or suspected (based on clinical deterioration or prolonged organ failure) . Other local complications include infections, portal/splenic vein thrombosis, hemorrhage, colonic necrosis and pancreatic fistulas . Likely systemic complications of acute pancreatitis include the following . MODS, more than one system may fail in the early phase (the first 2 weeks) of a severe attack; in the later phases multi-organ failure is usually secondary to sepsis from infected pancreatic necrosis . In severe necrotizing pancreatitis, however, there are significant late complications in up to 60% of patients .","An urgent CT scan of the abdomen should be performed if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Prognostic evaluation for the severity of the disease should be completed within the first 3 days of symptom onset. It should be determined whether gallstones are the cause of the attack; if so, urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy should be performed in severe cases; all cases of acute biliary pancreatitis usually require cholecystectomy. If severe acute pancreatitis with extensive necrosis is found beyond the first week, fine needle aspiration for bacteriology and fungi should be performed; if there is proven infected necrosis, pancreatic necrosectomy might be required. If the etiology is uncertain, endoscopic ultrasonography should be performed following resolution of the attack to exclude unusual causes of obstruction such as small stones or tumors."
9781908541680,ch_3,"This, combined with food processing that increases the energy density and decreases the nutrient and fiber content of food, and the consumption of sugared drinks instead of water for hydration, predispose individuals to serious chronic disease and premature death . Both the presence of nutrients in the stomach and the distension that results from food intake activate gastric vagal afferent pathways that convey signals to the hindbrain from where they project to other nuclei and circuits involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal function, intermediary metabolism, autonomic nerve function, and centers involved in the regulation of appetite . induce the release of peptides such as cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, oxyntomodulin and peptide YY, which integrate behavioral aspects of food intake, digestion and gut motility, insulin production by the pancreas, and intermediary metabolism in the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle . Regulation of energy expenditure involves basal metabolic rate (BMR); physical activity level (intentional, incidental and non-exercise-associated thermogenesis [NEAT]); and the thermic effect of food . Various factors may increase resting energy expenditure, including thyroid hormone, growth hormone and activation of the sympathetic nervous system . A desirable physical activity level (1.75 and higher) includes regular physical activity (at work or leisure time) with an intensity and duration that will reduce the risk of becoming overweight and developing a variety of non-communicable chronic diseases that are usually comorbidities associated with obesity . A landmark paper published in the British Medical Journal in 1995 entitled 'Obesity in Britain: gluttony or sloth?' concluded that reduction in physical activity, rather than increased energy intake, was the fundamental cause of the obesity epidemic . National epidemiological studies have shown that energy intake is now the dominant determinant of weight gain, and in some cases a decrease in physical activity follows rather than precedes weight gain . The prevalence of obesity is approximately 50% higher in people with serious mental health problems than in the general population, reflecting chaotic lifestyles, lack of involvement with traditional healthcare systems and possibly an underlying genetic predisposition to metabolic complications . Early behavioral interventions to improve diet and promote physical activity attenuate the effect of antipsychotics to induce weight gain; a 12-week lifestyle wellness program has been shown to result in a weight benefit of approximately 2 kg compared with a control group at 6-month follow-up . Indian immigrants have been shown to experience increased levels of weight gain and obesity after entering the UK, and African American women have higher fat intake and less physical activity than their white counterparts . Rapid growth between 5 and 7 years of age can be the result of 'adiposity rebound' - a period of increasing growth and body mass index (BMI) that may coincide with exposure to new environments and food and activity behavior patterns; an early adiposity rebound may lead to increased risk of obesity later in life . In men, reduction of leisure and work activity and the adoption of more sedentary lifestyles are important factors in weight gain . Individuals who change from an active to an inactive or sedentary lifestyle are inevitably at risk of becoming overweight/obese .","Physiological and genetic influences that promoted survival of our ancestors now promote obesity and comorbid disease. Genetic influences act alongside environmental factors to promote obesity. Transformation of our food habits has been a key factor in the increase of obesity and diabetes: energy-dense processed food is readily available in bigger and cheaper portions than ever before. Most causes of adult obesity are within the grasp of an individual to control, but babies and children rely on their parents and carers to provide an appropriate environment. Iatrogenic causes of obesity should be considered. The effect on weight of managing comorbid conditions is important, particularly diabetes in which weight gain is potentially catastrophic."
9781908541468,ch_3,"Urinary abnormalities will be found in most patients with renal disease, particularly positive dipstick tests for blood or protein, or the presence of cells, casts, crystals or organisms on urine microscopy . Clinically, severe hematuria may be reported if the patient has red or dark urine, which, if it occurs at the end of the urinary stream, suggests bleeding from the lower urinary tract . Proteinuria due to tubular damage is usually only low level (< 1 g/day) and involves proteins of a lower molecular weight, such as beta2-microglobulin . Albuminuria of more than 1 g/24 hours, in the absence of an obvious cause, should prompt further investigation, which might include kidney biopsy . Whereas significant albuminuria often indicates intrinsic renal parenchymal disease, hematuria may be caused by lesions throughout the urinary tract, particularly infection or malignancy (Table 1.2) . The presence of red-cell or granular casts in the urine is a more reliable way of identifying a renal source of the hematuria, as opposed to a ureteric or bladder source . Kidney function is assessed most simply by measuring the serum concentrations of metabolites excreted by the kidney, most commonly urea and creatinine . Changes in serum creatinine (especially a rise) can be a useful guide to deteriorating kidney function; absolute values do not correlate well with GFR . During a normal pregnancy in a woman with normal kidneys, renal plasma flow and GFR both increase (by >= 50%), leading to a reduction in the mean serum creatinine during the first and second trimesters from 73 µmol/L (0.8 mg/dL) to 51 µmol/L (0.5 mg/dL) . No fall in serum creatinine during pregnancy can indicate significant renal functional impairment . Creatinine clearance, which assesses creatinine excretion over 24 hours in relation to the serum creatinine level, is often used as a measure of GFR . These tests include measurement of blood glucose for diabetes mellitus, and serum electrophoresis for myeloma and other B-cell dyscrasias . The investigation of renal disease should always include some form of kidney imaging, which can provide both anatomic and functional information (Table 1.5) . It is particularly helpful in patients with severe proteinuria, hematuria that is not due to disease of the lower urinary tract, and acute kidney failure thought to be caused by intrinsic renal disease (rather than prerenal disease, obstruction or acute tubular necrosis [ATN]) . The main diseases diagnosed by kidney biopsy include glomerulonephritis, glomerular disorders such as amyloid and diabetes, and interstitial nephritis . Opinions differ as to when a kidney biopsy is indicated, but the potential benefit in terms of treatment usually outweighs the risk involved (significant bleeding in about 1 in 1000 cases) . In the presence of microscopic hematuria alone, or albuminuria of less than 1 g/24 hours, kidney biopsy is often not indicated since it is unlikely that a specific treatment would be required . However, higher levels of albuminuria or the combination of albuminuria and hematuria (particularly with casts) are indications for biopsy, because a number of causes of glomerulonephritis (see Chapter 6) and interstitial nephritis are now amenable to therapy .","Proteinuria and hematuria should always be investigated. Proteinuria should be quantified by means of an albumin:creatinine ratio or 24-hour collections, since the result will guide management. Hematuria may have a medical or surgical cause, and this should be assessed before starting investigations. Serum creatinine alone is an unreliable guide to kidney function; an assessment of glomerular filtration rate is more useful. No fall in serum creatinine during pregnancy can indicate significant renal functional impairment."
9781908541086,ch_7,"Treatment of eating disorders requires a multidisciplinary team of professionals to provide the appropriate care for the patient . It is the responsibility of every team member to inform each other, as well as appropriate family members, of the patient's state . As this is a complex multifactorial group of disorders, caregivers must anticipate long-term care, as treatment may require months or even years . The primary care physician, throughout treatment, has several important functions . to diagnose and treat any chronic and/or acute symptoms and complications . to monitor the patient's physiological status, including shifts in weight, blood pressure, pulse and other cardiovascular parameters . to inform other members of the treatment team and appropriate family members of the patient's physical state . to assess eating-disorder symptoms and behaviors . to monitor the patient's psychological status, including behavior shifts, cognitions, and emotions . It is important to emphasize these definitions of recovery as opposed to defining recovery simply as weight gain or a temporary change in behavior . Psychological health involves the development of normal eating behaviors, without restricting or purging, and the elimination of obsessions with body image, bodyweight and food . The medical aspect of treatment involves monitoring for common complications such as . Weight gain is important for the restoration of menses; 86% of patients who achieve 90% of their ideal bodyweight resume menses within 6 months . Osteopenia is the most serious, potentially irreversible complication of the low estrogen levels caused by prolonged amenorrhea . Nutritional factors also play an important role, as indicated by the more serious cases of osteopenia in anorexia compared with hypothalamic amenorrhea . Osteopenia is defined by a bone mineral density (BMD) of 1.0-2.5 standard deviations (SDs) below the young adult reference mean . Again, weight gain is crucial as an increase in BMD relies primarily on bodyweight . Patients who achieve more than 85% of their ideal bodyweight show significant improvement in spinal bone mass . Hormone replacement therapy has not been shown to be effective at increasing bone mass in the treatment of eating disorders . Weight gain is vital to improving bone mass . The following gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with eating disorders, particularly during the weight-restoration phase . As fear of eating and weight gain is characteristic of these patients, it may be difficult to distinguish between psychological distress and actual physical discomfort . Aggressive treatment is not necessary because these symptoms are adaptive and tend to resolve as normal eating patterns are established . However, the following medications can be prescribed to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms . This symptom is adaptive and will resolve with weight gain . rapid weight loss and gain (with SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics) . Initially, the acuity of weight loss dictates the frequency of follow-up, so some patients may require multiple weekly check-ups in an effort to avoid hospitalization . In the weight-restoration phase patients should be seen weekly . As patients achieve weight gain beyond the 85% ideal, and approaching 100%, they can be seen less frequently and monthly visits may suffice .","The treatment of eating disorders requires a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, involving the primary care physician, psychiatrist and nutritionist. The ultimate goal of treatment is both psychological and physical health. Psychological health comprises: healthy eating behaviors with no restricting or purging; the elimination of obsessions regarding body image, bodyweight and food; normal adaptive functioning in school/work and interpersonal relationships; and coping with normative stressors. Physical health is measured by the restoration of ideal bodyweight and return of menses. There are many complications, acute and chronic, associated with eating disorders that require ongoing management. Weight gain is crucial in order to restore menses and increase bone density."
9781910797495,chp3,"Other patients with more complexity or risk such as injuries or comorbid conditions (exempli gratia anxiety, depression, neuropathic condition) who are refractory to self-management alone, will require additional and more focused care such as condition-focused prescription medication and more formal behavioral and physical therapies . Too often patients are inadequately evaluated for risk factors for chronicity and treated with escalating doses of medication that only suppress symptoms, such that they begin to develop psychobiological (exempli gratia depression, anxiety, sleep), physical (exempli gratia weakness, gait/posture change) and social (exempli gratia job/family stress and loss) consequences . However, researchers consistently stress the need to improve the number and quality of trials to evaluate the effectiveness of chronic pain treatment programs, particularly the selective integration of two or more treatments to address different pathophysiological pain mechanisms or salient perpetuating factors (exempli gratia depression) . Whereas there is no clinical trial evidence that a similar approach for patients with chronic neuropathic pain syndromes is effective . Recent clinical trials indicate that a stepped model of care, with consultative/collaborative care by pain specialty teams (exempli gratia pain medicine physicians, psychologists, physical therapists) for treatment-resistant or complex cases, is cost effective for patients with low back pain with or without depression in a primary care setting . Although a major aim of self-management is to return the patient to a full range of normal psychosocial activities, the primary care provider and/or other members of the pain team (exempli gratia psychologist, physiotherapist, as required) must monitor the patient's progress and be alert to the emergence of psychological issues such as anxiety, depression or other issues that may be playing a role in the patient's chronic pain . Opioid-induced hyperalgesia may limit the long-term effectiveness of these drugs in some patients with chronic pain . Defining which group of patients with chronic non-cancer pain may benefit from the long-term use of opioids is a challenge . Unsatisfactory initial assessment of patients with chronic non-cancer pain has led, in some cases, to the inappropriate initial prescription of opioids without considering the broad range of potentially more suitable options or the risks for misuse, abuse, addiction and overdose . Furthermore, since chronic pain is an independent risk factor for suicide, patients with depression are at risk for an overdose of medication, no matter the opioid dose provided . The risk of respiratory depression when the opioid dose is carefully titrated to decrease chronic or cancer pain is less than 1% in the opioid-naive patient, although it is higher in older individuals, those with chronic lung disease and those who are also using benzodiazepines . The risk of addiction in patients receiving opioids for the first time for medical purposes, such as the treatment of cancer pain, is very low (see also Chapter 2) . However, unless detailed assessment of potential risks is carried out before prescribing opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (see Chapter 2), there is a clinically significant risk of addiction . Patients in need of analgesics for chronic pain should therefore be informed of the risks, and the lowest effective doses should be prescribed for the shortest appropriate duration .","As chronic pain is a multidimensional interdisciplinary biopsychosocial condition, expert consensus and some research recommends a selective, interdisciplinary, mechanism-based approach as the method of choice to restore quality of life and functionality. The specific disciplines of healthcare providers required to offer a multidisciplinary approach depend on the variety and complexity of patients seen and the available resources, as outlined in the stepped care model. Most pain care will occur in primary care settings, but ideally with close support from interdisciplinary teams of relevant health practitioners (exempli gratia psychology, physical therapy, complementary and integrative medicine) including pain medicine and other relevant specialists. The education of patients about their pain conditions, enabling their participation in shared decision-making and the development of self-management skills, is now considered a cornerstone of successful pain management, whether it is delivered at home, in primary care or specialty care settings. Research evidence to support the effectiveness of the selective, interdisciplinary stepped approach to chronic pain treatment is not yet conclusive; more research is needed to prove its cost-effectiveness in specific pain phenotypes. Pharmacotherapy of chronic and cancer pain is mostly multimodal, combining several different drugs that act on different targets. Pharmacotherapy is often combined with other treatment options. Opioids play a major role in cancer pain but data for their long-term effectiveness in chronic non-cancer pain are limited. There is substantial variation among patients in dose-response and side effects for individual drugs within a drug category. Thus, careful drug titration is required for each individual patient."
9781910797006,ch01,"In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pathological changes occur in the central conducting airways, the peripheral airways, the lung parenchyma and the pulmonary vasculature (Figure 1.1) . The extent of the pathological changes in the different lung compartments varies between individuals and results in the clinical and pathophysiological heterogeneity seen in patients with COPD . Although the clinical and physiological presentation of chronic asthma may be indistinguishable from that of COPD, the pathological changes are distinct from those in most COPD cases due to cigarette smoking . Bronchial biopsy studies have described inflammation in the bronchi of patients with chronic bronchitis with and without airway obstruction, and have shown that activated T lymphocytes are prominent in the proximal airways . Several studies using bronchoalveolar lavage, spontaneous or induced sputum, have demonstrated intraluminal inflammation in the airspaces of patients with chronic bronchitis with or without airway obstruction . There is also evidence that the airspace inflammation in patients with chronic bronchitis persists following smoking cessation if the production of sputum persists, though cough and sputum are reduced in most smokers who quit . The mechanisms leading to the increase in peripheral airway resistance include several distinct processes: destruction of alveolar support, loss of elastic recoil in the parenchyma that contributes to this support and provides driving pressure for alveolar emptying, and structural narrowing of the airway lumen . As the condition progresses, structural remodeling may occur, characterized by increased collagen content and formation of scar tissue, which narrows the airways and produces fixed airway obstruction (Figure 1.3) . Pulmonary emphysema is defined in structural and pathological terms as 'abnormal permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles accompanied by destruction of their walls' . Three principal types of emphysema are recognized according to the distribution of the enlarged airspaces within the acinar unit (Figure 1.5): centriacinar (centrilobular), panacinar (panlobular) and periacinar (paraseptal) . The association with cigarette smoking is certainly clearer for centriacinar than panacinar emphysema, though smokers can develop both types . In around 20% of cases the surrounding lung is normal, but most bullae are associated with more generalized emphysema and chronic airway obstruction . The development of chronic alveolar hypoxia in patients with COPD results in hypoxic vasoconstriction of the small pulmonary arteries and, consequently, an inflammatory response in the arteries similar to that in the lungs . The pathological changes in patients with COPD are complex and may occur to varying extents in the large and small airways, and in the alveolar compartment . The normal inflammatory response in the lungs to the inhalation of irritants, such as cigarette smoke, appears to be enhanced and abnormally persistent in patients with COPD . Structural cells obtained from the lungs of patients with COPD have been shown to manifest persistently altered functions when cultured in vitro, perhaps as a result of epigenetic modifications . The altered function of structural cells may account for the persistence of inflammation and progression of COPD, once established, even if cigarette smoking is stopped .","COPD results from pathological changes in the large and small airways (bronchiolitis) and in the alveolar space (emphysema). Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as the production of sputum on most days for at least 3 months a year over at least 2 consecutive years. Inflammation occurs in large and small airways, and in the alveolar space, most commonly involving a number of cells including neutrophils, macrophages and T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ lymphocytes. Small-airways disease or bronchiolitis can result in inflammation and eventually scarring of the small airways; this is an important pathological change in COPD, which is difficult to assess by respiratory function tests, but may be a major source of airway obstruction. Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema is the most common form of emphysema, particularly in smokers, and is distributed mainly in the upper zones of the lungs. Panacinar (panlobular) emphysema has a more diffuse distribution, predominantly in the lower zones of the lungs, and is associated with alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency; it can also occur in some smokers. Bullae are emphysematous spaces over 1 cm in diameter. Combinations of these pathological changes to varying degrees in different individuals with COPD contribute to the airflow limitation. The lungs of patients with COPD show an amplified and persistent inflammatory response to the inhalation of particles and gases, particularly those in cigarette smoke. A protease:antiprotease and oxidant:antioxidant imbalance is part of this amplified inflammatory response. Once COPD is established, the inflammatory process persists even after smoking cessation."
9783318066241,ch3,"Physical examination, laboratory tests and imaging are needed to diagnose acute pancreatitis (AP) . In the emergency room, a CT scan is the most useful imaging test for diagnosing AP, followed by MRI; conventional ultrasonography is less reliable . CT/MRI to confirm the diagnosis of AP should be reserved for cases with atypical symptoms and/or those rare cases without an increase in pancreatic enzyme serum levels . Contrast enhancement is useful for differential diagnosis (especially to rule out acute mesenteric ischemia) and to detect necrosis (although an early CT scan may be falsely negative for pancreatic necrosis); however, but in cases of kidney failure or allergy, a CT scan without contrast enhancement can detect peripancreatic fat stranding or peripancreatic collections typical of AP . serum amylase or lipase activity at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal . Most patients can be diagnosed on the basis of the first two criteria, with imaging required only in individuals with atypical symptoms or low serum enzyme activity . Jaundice is frequently seen in cases of persistent choledocholithiasis, or more infrequently in patients with compression of the bile duct due to inflammation and/or collections (in these cases the jaundice usually develops days or weeks after presentation) . Some patients with moderate-to-severe AP may develop reversible neuropsychiatric symptoms (exempli gratia delirium, hallucinations, convulsive and/or focal seizures) in the absence of organic triggers; this rare complication is known as pancreatic encephalopathy . Other rare symptoms and signs of AP are the development of tender subcutaneous nodules (pancreatic panniculitis due to circulating lipase-induced digestion of subcutaneous fat) (see Figure 3.1) and loss of vision due to Purtscher retinopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome . Most patients with AP have amylase and/or lipase serum activity greater than three times the upper level of normal . The amylase increase is first detected 2-12 hours after the onset of symptoms of AP; the level peaks at 12-72 hours and usually normalizes within 5 days . Serum lipase levels increase within 4-8 hours after the onset of symptoms; they peak at 24 hours, and return to normal after 8-14 days . The half-life of lipase is longer than amylase, so patients with a delayed presentation in the emergency room may show normal amylase activity with increased lipase activity . Hypertriglyceridemia (> 500 mg/mL) may be associated with falsely low levels of amylase and lipase activity . This is likely to be due to interference with the assay and so, in patients with lipemic plasma and typical symptoms of AP but unexpectedly low levels of pancreatic enzyme activity, the plasma can be serially diluted and the enzymes measured again, or imaging should be performed . Increased serum pancreatic enzyme activity may also be due to other conditions (Table 3.1 and Table 3.2) and about 1 in 10 patients may be wrongly diagnosed as having AP by blood or urinary tests . As indicated in Table 3.1, any cause of acute abdomen may be associated with increased enzyme activity in blood; in general, the more elevated the pancreatic enzyme activity level, the greater the specificity for AP .","The most frequent presentation of acute pancreatitis (AP) is severe epigastric pain radiating to the flanks and/or back, nausea and vomiting. Most patients are diagnosed based on typical pain and increased serum pancreatic enzyme activity greater than three times the upper limit of normal. Diseases other than AP may be associated with increased pancreatic enzyme serum activity. Differential diagnosis is important as most of these conditions require specific treatment. Abdominal imaging is useful for confirming the diagnosis of AP in atypical cases, ruling out other conditions."
9781912776207,ch7,"The current standard of care for PTCL is anthracycline-based CHOP, followed by consolidation in first complete remission (CR1) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in fit and eligible patients, given that remission tends to be short following induction chemotherapy . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may be considered for patients with high-risk subtypes of PTCL (id est ENKTCL, ATLL and HSTCL) . The rarity and heterogeneity of PTCL have precluded a large randomized study to assess the best consolidation strategy (ASCT or alloSCT) after completing induction therapy, and studies comparing consolidation transplantation versus maintenance therapy have not been conducted . In addition, the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) is low because the patient receives a transplant of their own cells . The US Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Registry (CIBMTR), which collects data from US transplant centers, reported outcomes for T-cell lymphomas in 2013, based on 115 patients (median age 43 years at time of transplant) . This study compared outcomes with and without ASCT in 269 patients (aged <= 65 years) with PTCL-NOS (n = 78), AITL (n = 123) or ALK + ALCL (n = 68) . With this approach, donor T and natural killer (NK) cells exert a graft versus lymphoma (GVL) effect, regardless of whether the disease is chemosensitive or -refractory, although the former is associated with longer PFS . The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 53% and 57%, respectively, and were influenced by disease status at the time of transplant . Based on anecdotal reports of high TRM (30%) with MAC induction chemotherapy, Corradini evaluated reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) followed by alloSCT (n = 17; median age at transplant 41 years) . The CIBMTR study has also published outcomes from a large cohort of heavily pretreated patients (n = 126; median age at transplant, 38 years) . In summary, alloSCT offers long-term disease control in 30-55% of patients with relapsed/refractory PTCL but is associated with NRM rates of 12-36% . A large Japanese registry study reported median OS following alloSCT of 9.9 months and a 3-year OS rate of 36% . Murashige and colleagues reported a study of 28 patients in Japan with predominantly ENKTCL (n = 22) who underwent alloSCT: 2-year PFS and OS rates were 34% and 40%, respectively . A total of 54 patients were identified, with a median age at transplantation of 34 years; 94% had stage IV disease . The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation reported outcomes for 18 patients who underwent alloSCT: at a median follow up of 3 years, 2 patients had disease relapse post-transplant and the 3-year PFS was 48% . A 2016 study retrospectively compared ASCT and alloSCT in 60 patients with high-risk PTCL (IPI score >= 3), 22 with PTCL-NOS, 22 with ALK − ALCL and 16 with AITL . This study demonstrates the potential of GVL in patients with high-risk PTCL even if CR or PR is not achieved before transplant . The potential of GVL following stem cell transplantation to decrease relapse rates compared with other contemporary treatment modalities in the management of PTCL has been clearly demonstrated .","Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as a consolidation strategy is an option for patients who achieve a complete response with front-line chemotherapy. Phase II studies have shown that about 40% of patients who undergo ASCT at first remission are disease free at 5 years. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) provides long-term disease control in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and as a front-line consolidation for patients with more aggressive PTCL subtypes. Complications from alloSCT include serious infections resulting from immune suppression, and chronic graft versus host disease. In a randomized study, outcomes were similar with upfront ASCT and alloSCT, with more patients in the autologous arm relapsing and more in the allogeneic arm experiencing transplant-related morbidity and mortality."
9781910797150,ch03,"In all the clinical trials of granisetron for CINV, a complete responder was defined as a patient who experienced 'no vomiting and no, or only mild, nausea' in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy . The first double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted in 28 patients with cancer receiving cisplatin chemotherapy (mean dose > 80 mg/m); they were given either a single intravenous dose of granisetron, 40 μg/kg, or placebo . The effectiveness of granisetron in the management of nausea and vomiting induced by multiple-day chemotherapy was evaluated in two comparative studies comprising 481 patients . The efficacy of a single dose of intravenous granisetron, 40 μg/kg or 3 mg, was assessed in a multicenter study over a 7-day period, with 533 patients receiving cisplatin chemotherapy (275 mg/m) . The primary endpoint was attained in the multicenter placebo-controlled phase III MAGIC trial (Modified Absorption Granisetron In the Prevention of CINV), in patients receiving HEC regimens . The original clinical data on ondansetron in CINV appeared in 1987 in a study of 15 patients receiving non-cisplatin cytotoxic drugs of moderate or mild emetogenic potential, including an anthracycline, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, epirubicin, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, etoposide and 5-fluorouracil, given in various combinations . In these multicenter studies, ondansetron, 8 mg (either oral or parenteral), was more effective than metoclopramide in preventing acute emesis in patients receiving various combinations of emetogenic agents, including high doses of cyclophosphamide (2500 mg/m), doxorubicin (240 mg/m), epirubicin (240 mg/m) or 5-fluorouracil . In a double-blind crossover study comparing ondansetron and dexamethasone, in which patients received intravenous non-platinum MEC (mostly comprising an anthracycline and/or cyclophosphamide and/or etoposide), delayed nausea (days 2-5) was significantly better controlled by dexamethasone alone than by ondansetron alone . In a randomized crossover study of 20 patients receiving a mean cisplatin dose of 77.5 mg/m, tropisetron was significantly better (p <0.001) at controlling acute nausea and vomiting than a combination of metoclopramide and lorazepam . Clinical experiences from various studies in patients receiving cisplatin, 50-120 mg/m, confirmed that tropisetron, 5 mg, administered intravenously or orally once daily, was more efficient in preventing acute CINV than metoclopramide, 4-7 mg/kg . When compared with antiemetic combinations based on high doses of metoclopramide, dexamethasone and lorazepam or diphenhydramine in patients receiving cisplatin-based chemotherapy, tropisetron was just as effective in preventing acute vomiting, but less effective in preventing acute nausea . In two phase III trials, a triple combination of aprepitant, ondansetron and dexamethasone was found to have significantly greater rates of complete response than ondansetron plus dexamethasone in patients receiving cisplatin-based HEC . In a cisplatin-based HEC study, Kaplan-Meier curves of 'time to first emesis' showed that patients who received an antiemetic regimen containing aprepitant fared significantly better than patients who received only standard therapy (p <0.001); the treatment groups began to differ noticeably about 16 hours after the administration of chemotherapy (Figure 3.2) . In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose range-finding, phase II study, 454 patients being treated with HEC (>= 70 mg/m cisplatin-based chemotherapy) were randomized to receive ondansetron plus dexamethasone and either placebo or 9, 22.5, 90 or 180 mg of rolapitant before chemotherapy on day 1 of each cycle .","Serotonin (5-HT ) receptor antagonists (RAs) (ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, dolasetron and palonosetron) have their main antiemetic effect during the acute CINV phase. Neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonists (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, rolapitant and netupitant) have their main antiemetic effect during the delayed CINV phase. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone in particular) have a significant role in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed CINV, and are an essential part of almost all antiemetic regimens in clinical practice. A combination of a triple antiemetic regimen of a 5-HT RA, an NK-1 RA and a corticosteroid is very effective in antiemetic prophylaxis for patients receiving cispatin, AC (anthracycline and cyclophosphamide)-based and highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) regimens. Recent data have shown that a combination of a triple antiemetic regimen of a 5-HT RA, an NK-1 RA and a corticosteroid is very effective in the prophylaxis of moderately emetogenic chmeotherapy (MEC) regimens, in particular carboplatin-based treatment. 5-HT RAs, NK-1 RAs and corticosteroids are not very effective in the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea. Nausea control remains a challenge in the management of CINV."
9781910797693,chp3,"This totality of experience available with the original reference product can highlight issues such as immunogenicity or multiple potential mechanisms of action that will be critical in developing follow-on products . Manufacturers and regulators define quality according to critical 'quality attributes': chemical, physical and biological properties that need to be within agreed tolerances . The upper and lower limits of the tolerance are referred to as the 'developmental corridor' (Figure 3.1); quality control monitoring of production batches by manufacturers ensures that the product reaching the patient is within the developmental corridor, such that a predictable effect can be expected . Batches of biologics vary over time, and this is true for both the originator and biosimilar drug . Clinical studies of an originator drug to support different indications are likely to have been conducted with different batches . A change in the production process of a biological drug (originator or biosimilar) could affect outcomes . For this reason, manufacturing changes are regulated to ensure that new batches of product meet the defined critical attributes . The regulation of biosimilar production is based on the procedures developed to address changes to manufacturing of originator biologics . Biologic and biosimilar drug developers can determine the natural variation in the structure and biopotency of the reference drug from sequential batches of the drug . Variation in these attributes over time defines the limits of acceptable analytic differences that a regulator accepts between a reference drug and its biosimilar and so defines the development corridor for a biosimilar . In some circumstances, a biosimilar that has a notable difference in a critical attribute from the reference product may be permitted by regulators, as in the example of epoetin alfa: a biosimilar version is available that has a relatively high level of phosphorylated mannose-type structures (compared with the reference compound) . Immunogenicity is a potential safety concern with any biological agent, and even slight changes in structural properties or impurities could, in theory, trigger an adverse immune reaction . Product drift over time and evolution through manufacturing changes may produce structural differences in a reference biologic, meaning that no biologic can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . Immunogenicity cannot yet be predicted from analytic or animal studies with sufficient accuracy for biologic medicines . For this reason, clinical studies in humans remain a current requirement for biosimilar medicines (though not routinely required for a biologic drug undergoing a manufacturing change or small molecule generics) . Regulators are concerned to identify differences in toxic potential such as acute anaphylaxis or reductions in efficacy through the development of neutralizing anti-drug antibodies that increase the clearance of the drug . Biosimilars do not have to show that they have no immunogenicity - just that the levels are similar to those of the originator . In contrast, documented immunogenicity differences with clinical impact have been reported for originator medicines undergoing manufacturing changes and with intended copy biologic drugs from less regulated medical regions of the world .","The quality attributes - chemical, physical, and biological properties - of a biologic must be within a development corridor that defines the acceptable upper and lower limits of the marketed product. The regulations were originally developed to cover variation in batches of biologics resulting from manufacturing changes, including procedures to ensure that batches of originator biologics were within the development corridor."
9781912776276,chp5,"Since Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) is frequently associated with dementia, and dementia ultimately affects most people with PD, the need to evaluate for additional causes of dementia is usually small . It is crucial to review all medications taken by the patient, including non-PD drugs (Table 5.1), as many drugs, particularly anticholinergics taken for overactive bladder symptoms, are common causes or contributors to PDP (Case report 5.1), as well as to confusion and delirium . Clozapine is approved in the EU, but not the USA, for the treatment of PDP when standard treatment has failed (id est after addressing any medical causes of psychosis and limiting the use of PD mediations to those that preserve motor function) . Even though each trial enrolled only 60 subjects, both showed clinically and statistically significant improvements on all measures of psychosis, with an impressive standardized effect size > 0.7, as well as improvement in tremor (a prespecified secondary outcome based on open-label observations) . Thus, clozapine was found to be both effective and generally well tolerated in terms of motor function at a mean dose lower than 37.5 mg daily (Case report 5.4) . Olanzapine, which is primarily approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and refractory depression, was initially found to be extremely effective and well tolerated in 15 patients with PDP in an open-label study . One open-label study reported excellent results, with good psychosis response and no motor worsening, but a double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial found no benefit . Quetiapine, which is approved for use in schizophrenia and psychosis associated with bipolar disorder and severe depression, has been reported in numerous open-label reports in people with PD to be an effective antipsychotic that does not worsen motor function (Case report 5.5) . Nevertheless, five double-blind placebo-controlled trials (four in PD, one in PDD/DLB), using different assessment tools, found no benefit of quetiapine treatment, although it was well tolerated from the perspective of motor side effects . In addition, the antipsychotic effect of clozapine in patients with PDP occurs at such low doses that binding to the limbic D2 receptors is unlikely to be the mechanism by which psychotic symptoms improve; the blocking of 5HT2A receptors is a more likely explanation . It is not yet approved in Europe for this indication, or for other psychotic syndromes, including DLB, although it is being investigated for major depressive disorder, dementia-related psychosis and schizophrenia . The drug was generally well tolerated, even when added to quetiapine, clozapine or dementia medications, and no difference in response was noted between patients with PDD and DLB . Despite this, cholinesterase inhibitors are usually used as the first-line therapy in clinical practice for psychotic symptoms in patients with DLB . Case series and open-label studies in people with PD treated with cholinesterase inhibitors report improvements in psychotic symptoms, - but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed . Memantine has given conflicting results in people with DLB and PDD, but overall there is no specific evidence to suggest it is of benefit in the treatment of psychotic symptoms .","The first approach to treatment is to look for contributing factors such as infection, metabolic disorders or non-PD-related psychoactive medications. Only clozapine and pimavanserin have proven efficacy for Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). While clozapine works quickly, pimavanserin requires 4-6 weeks to improve psychotic symptoms. Although clozapine doses are one-tenth to one-hundredth of those used in schizophrenia, the risk of granulocytopenia and agranulocytosis is thought to be unchanged, so close blood monitoring is still required. Quetiapine is widely used (on the basis of open-label reports) even though there is no clear evidence of efficacy and increasing evidence of adverse effects, including mortality risk. Cholinesterase inhibitors confer overall benefits in people with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, with some evidence of a specific beneficial effect in the treatment of psychosis. Further work is needed to determine potential benefits of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment for PDP in the absence of dementia. Trials of novel pharmacological and psychological treatment approaches are now being initiated; this is likely to be an evolving field over the next 5 years."
9781912776139,ch1,"Part of the persistent confusion around nomenclature arises from an array of terms in the literature that have been inconsistently used to delineate phenotypes across the spectrum of ALS; for example, progressive muscular atrophy, primary lateral sclerosis and progressive bulbar palsy . ALS results in progressive weakness of muscles beyond the site of the initial symptoms . Despite attempts to define neurophysiological diagnostic criteria for ALS, the bedside clinical examination together with a compatible history of progressive weakness remains the gold standard for diagnosing ALS . However, it is important to recognize that ALS is a syndrome, with a spectrum of clinically apparent UMN and LMN involvement (Figure 1.4) . At their extreme, such phenotypes used to be called progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), but post mortem studies have identified subclinical UMN involvement, and in vivo MRI has shown a similar pattern of advanced white matter tract involvement to that seen in typical ALS, with evidence of extramotor cognitive impairment . At the other end of the spectrum, fewer than 3% of cases exhibit a clinically UMN-only phenotype (see Figure 1.5a), with a striking absence of muscle wasting at any point in the disease course . The mean age of onset of PLS is around 10 years younger than for typical ALS, usually with lower-limb or bulbar dysfunction . Only a few cases of PLS have been examined using modern molecular histopathological phenotyping, with inconsistent reporting of the ALS-defining signature of cellular inclusions of transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43) . PMA and PLS (id est clinically pure LMN and UMN forms of progressive motor weakness) are currently excluded from the diagnostic criteria for ALS (see page 86) . In between these extremes, the terms LMN-predominant and UMN-predominant ALS have become accepted in recognition of the burden of clinical signs (see Figure 1.4) . The initial site of symptom onset typically retains the highest burden of progressive disability . The most consistent feature is markedly slower progression (in contrast to more common cases of upper-limb-onset ALS); survival up to 10 years and beyond is quite common . The selective vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS is striking in that it is not dependent on axonal length, but some cases do show a symmetric, distal lower-limb LMN-predominant phenotype that gradually spreads proximally, often over years (see Figure 1.5c) . Although about one-third of ALS cases have a bulbar onset to symptoms, a distinctive phenotype of isolated, predominantly corticobulbar, palsy may be identified, typically in elderly women . Cognitive dysfunction is more commonly identified in those with a bulbar onset of motor symptoms . The major limitation of a unified TDP-43-based approach to the classification of ALS is the anatomic disconnection between the range of clinical phenotypes and rates of progression . Given that molecular taxonomies of ALS transcend or confound attempts to produce clinical criteria for these variants, supports the view that ALS is more usefully stratified in terms of rate of symptom progression rather than variable sites and patterns of symptom onset and spread .","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is not one disease, but a syndrome that overlaps with frontotemporal dementia. ALS is primarily a progressive motor-predominant syndrome. There is significant variability in the clinical evidence of upper and lower motor neuron involvement. The initial regional patterns of body involvement vary, but generalized involvement over time is the norm. Variation in the speed of symptom progression is not closely tied to any single phenotypic classifier. Symptom onset is focal and tends to spread contiguously. Neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions of transactive response DNA-binding protein with M r 43 kDa (TDP-43) are the consistent histopathological feature in nearly all cases."
9781910797105,ch11,"Psychosocial interventions and non-drug treatments . Since the 1970s psychosocial interventions have been a key part of the management of schizophrenia . At that time, the adverse effect of institutionalization on people with schizophrenia came to be realized, and this led to the increased development of community-based services . More recently, specific psychological techniques aimed at improving aspects of schizophrenia have also been evaluated (Table 11.1) . The concept of high 'expressed emotion' within families as an environmental predictor of relapse in schizophrenia was suggested in the 1960s by Brown and Rutter . Families who showed overinvolvement or excessive criticism were associated with high relapse rates in individuals with schizophrenia . Nevertheless, family-based interventions aimed at enhancing coping strategies by education about the illness (Table 11.2) have been shown to improve prognosis . A meta-analysis of the best randomized controlled trials, with a collective total of 350 patients and their families, found that such interventions, usually delivered over 9 months, were both effective and cost-effective . Patients who had family interventions showed lower relapse rates and improved drug compliance . Family support combined with individual psychological techniques has been shown to reduce relapse rates in schizophrenia complicated by substance misuse . Psychological treatment of positive symptoms . The idea that cognitive behavioral treatments that are effective in people with major depression might be effective in treating positive psychotic symptoms dates from the 1990s . Coupled with the failure of psychoanalytical treatments for schizophrenia in the 1950s and 1960s, this view left a legacy of skepticism about psychological approaches . Since the mid-1990s, however, randomized controlled trials have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be effective for persistent psychotic symptoms in chronic schizophrenia when given in addition to routine care (Case history 11.1) . Secondary analyses of these trials suggest that as important as the actual CBT is the patient-rated 'therapeutic alliance' - the positive feelings of the patient towards the therapist . Components of CBT are shown in Table 11.3 . Trials have also shown that these techniques, added to drug treatment, may improve outcomes for psychotic symptoms in acute psychosis, including first-episode schizophrenia . It has been adapted as a potential intervention for people with schizophrenia who are non-adherent to pharmacological treatment . Cognitive remediation involves processes such as repeated practice and scaffolding, a learning technique in which the therapist helps the patient to solve problems by providing support for aspects of the task that the patient cannot accomplish, while removing assistance in areas in which the patient is competent . These processes take place over days and weeks to train up key cognitive functions in chronic schizophrenia . It has been shown to deliver cognitive improvements that persist beyond the end of treatment, although generalization to improved functioning is more likely if an overall rehabilitation program is also given . Computer- and web-based cognitive remediation approaches are now available . Other non-drug treatments . People with schizophrenia should be supported in exploring other ways of managing their condition .","Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) administered in addition to drug treatment reduces persistent positive symptoms. CBT can also abort relapses if targeted at early signs. Cognitive remediation is effective in reducing cognitive impairments, although generalization to global functioning is an issue."
9781908541666,ch_11,"Acute hypoglycemia potentially threatens the quality of life on a daily basis for people with type 1 diabetes . It may also affect patients with type 2 diabetes, especially those who are treated with sulfonylureas or insulin . Hypoglycemia represents a considerable barrier to the goal of achievement of near-normal blood glucose levels in insulin-treated patients . It is feared by patients with diabetes treated with insulin and has the capacity to seriously disrupt their lives . The symptoms of hypoglycemia are listed in Table 10.1 . The initial symptoms of hypoglycemia are caused by sympathoadrenal activation . Patients come to recognize their own hypoglycemic symptoms, which are often highly individualized . If hypoglycemia is not reversed promptly then patients may go on to develop symptoms due to neuroglycopenia (resulting from brain neuronal glucose deprivation) and these symptoms include behavioral changes, cognitive dysfunction and even seizures and coma . Less commonly, some patients may not experience initial sympathetic symptoms and present with neuroglycopenia, a complication known as hypoglycemic unawareness . Hypoglycemia unawareness is a potentially reversible situation with expert help . In people with type 1 diabetes, 2-4% of deaths have been attributed to hypoglycemia . People with type 1 diabetes experience symptomatic hypoglycemia on average twice per week, with significant disabling hypoglycemia occurring approximately once a year . Hypoglycemia is much less common in people with type 2 diabetes but frequently goes unrecognized . In the UK Hypoglycaemia Study Group, there was a low incidence of hypoglycemia in those taking oral hypoglycemic drugs, but an appreciable incidence in those on insulin therapy . The glucose threshold that triggers hypoglycemia in diabetic patients is different from that in people without diabetes . Hypoglycemia may be experienced at a higher plasma glucose threshold in patients with poorly controlled diabetes, while patients with tightly controlled diabetes may tolerate remarkably low plasma glucose levels without experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms . It is generally recommended that patients avoid having glucose concentrations below 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL), as frequent exposure to glucose levels below this threshold may result in the aforementioned phenomenon of hypoglycemic unawareness . Hypoglycemia in diabetes is a consequence of absolute or relative excess of exogenously administered insulin or endogenous insulin secretion . Death from hypoglycemia is rare, but it may follow excess alcohol consumption or deliberate insulin overdose . Occasionally, tragically unexpected deaths happen in young patients with type 1 diabetes; these often occur in bed and it has been speculated that they may result from hypoglycemia-induced cardiac dysrhythmias . Most episodes of hypoglycemia are self-treated and respond quickly to the ingestion of glucose tablets, fruit juices or a soft drink . When hypoglycemia is so severe that the patient is unwilling or unable to take anything orally, parenteral therapy is required . Partners, parents, relatives or close associates of people with type 1 diabetes should be taught how to inject the affected individual with glucagon, 1 mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously (followed by the ingestion of carbohydrates to restore hepatic glycogen) . If 10% glucose is used, a larger volume will be required to correct the hypoglycemia .",Symptomatic hypoglycemia is common in patients with type 1 diabetes. Hypoglycemia is a barrier to the achievement of tight glycemic control. Frequent hypoglycemia may lead to the development of hypoglycemia unawareness. There are many and varied causes of hypoglycemia. Death from hypoglycemia is rare.
9781910797426,ch07,"Dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi complex and gallbladder . Disorders of the sphincter of Oddi may present as sphincter stenosis or dyskinesia . Dysfunction mostly occurs after cholecystectomy, but it may occur in a patient with an intact gallbladder; this occurs more often in young women . Symptoms and signs include biliary-type pain and, in some patients, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may present as recurrent pancreatitis . Sphincter of Oddi manometry could be considered to confirm a diagnosis of type II biliary dysfunction . An increase in the size of the bile duct (> 2 mm) after injection of cholecystokinin, or an increase in the size of the pancreatic duct (> 1.5 mm) after injection of secretin supports the diagnosis of biliary or pancreatic sphincter dysfunction, respectively . Hepatobiliary scintigraphy with technetium-99m may help establish the existence of delayed biliary drainage and support a diagnosis of biliary sphincter dysfunction . Oral nifedipine has been found to relieve pain in patients who had previously undergone cholecystectomy, and who had elevated basal pressure and sphincter of Oddi phasic contractions of predominantly antegrade nature . Endoscopic treatment for all types of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction takes the form of biliary or pancreatic sphincterotomy during ERCP . Patients with type I biliary sphincter dysfunction respond well to sphincterotomy, which can be performed without manometry of the biliary sphincter . Type III biliary dysfunction is the hardest to treat, and there is no clear consensus on or understanding of invasive diagnostic procedures, treatment with sphincterotomy or the existence of other contributing or alternative causes of pain . A randomized sham-controlled trial of sphincterotomy in patients with pain after cholecystectomy, without significant imaging findings (dilated bile duct) or laboratory abnormalities, showed that sphincterotomy was not more effective than a sham procedure . This study mostly involved patients in the type III sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group . Based on this evidence-based study, some have suggested that sphincter of Oddi dysfunction type III is not a real disease and one should not pursue manometry or ERCP in these patients . Gallbladder dyskinesia is a disorder caused by abnormal motility or contraction of the gallbladder in the absence of gallstones . Patients with other gastrointestinal motility disorders are likely to be at increased risk . An ejection fraction below 35-40% is considered abnormal and these patients are more likely to respond to cholecystectomy . In some patients the pain of gallbladder dyskinesia is reproduced when CCK is administered . In patients whose gallbladder ejection fraction by CCK-stimulated scintigraphy is less than 35-40%, a significant number will experience improvement or resolution of pain following cholecystectomy . Before attempting cholecystectomy other diagnoses need to be eliminated as a cause for the patient's abdominal pain . Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and pain-causing mechanisms attributed to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction so far . Improved understanding of other diseases and mechanisms that cause pain similar to, or overlapping with, pain considered to be from sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and gallbladder dyskinesia/functional gallbladder disorder .","Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction may be due to anatomic stenosis or a spastic functional disorder, and is most common after cholecystectomy. A lot of controversy surrounds this topic. Data suggest that sphincterotomy is not more effective than a sham procedure in patients with type III dysfunction, leading some to suggest type III dysfunction may not be a real disease. Sphincter of Oddi manometry is the diagnostic gold standard for the dysfunction. Biliary or pancreatic duct pressure of more than 40 mmHg is diagnostic of biliary or pancreatic sphincter dysfunction, respectively. A low gallbladder ejection fraction of less than 35-40% on Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan with gallbladder stimulation may be diagnostic of gallbladder dyskinesia (functional gallbladder disorder), and is the best predictor of response to cholecystectomy. The pain of gallbladder dyskinesia is reproduced in some patients when cholecystokinin is administered."

Topical retinoids are useful as first-line agents and topical antibiotics, when used, should be combined with BPO, ideally as a fixed-dose combination product to enhance adherence . Retinoids, azelaic acid and BPO are effective for comedones and inflammatory acne . Topical antibiotics such as erythromycin and clindamycin are most effective for inflammatory lesions . It is important to note that topical antibiotics should be combined with BPO to reduce the emergence of resistant Propionibacterium acnes (P . Patients often seek medical attention for their acne after trying a variety of over-the-counter products including soaps, scrubs, creams, lotions and gels . BPO is mostly available in over-the-counter and prescription formulations, including bar soaps, washes, gels and lotions . BPO is generally used as a single agent and in combination products with topical antibiotics or the topical retinoid adapalene (see page 52) . Topical retinoids are effective agents in the treatment of acne . The gel has been shown to be effective against acne at 5% concentration; recent studies suggest topical dapsone 5% gel may be particularly beneficial in regimens for adult women with acne (see pages 26-9) . Salicylic acid, a beta-hydroxy acid, is keratolytic and an irritant; it may promote the resolution of inflammatory lesions through its drying effect . Combination products containing salicylic acid and BPO or sulfur are also available . It is available as a topical cream that has been shown to be effective in inflammatory and comedonal acne . Azelaic acid is reported to have fewer local side effects than topical retinoids . Topical antibiotics such as erythromycin and clindamycin come in a variety of formulations and packaging: creams, lotions, ointments, gels and solutions . acnes has developed resistance to both topical and oral antibiotics . For these reasons, the use of topical antibiotics as single agents for acne is to be discouraged . Topical retinoids and BPO are useful as first-line agents . Recent advances in topical acne therapy include the development of fixed combination products that target more than one pathogenic feature of the disease and may also increase treatment adherence among patients . Combination products that include BPO offer excellent bactericidal effects and, when combined with erythromycin or clindamycin, offset the emergence of antibiotic-resistant P . A fixed combination of BPO with adapalene targets three of the four pathogenic features of acne without the use of antibiotics . Most topical acne treatments, including salicylic acid, BPO and topical retinoids will cause some degree of erythema, dryness and scaling of the skin . Most patients will develop tolerance to the local side effects of topical retinoids within 3-4 weeks . If patients are unable to tolerate daily application of a topical retinoid, an alternate-day or every-third-day regimen can be followed until tolerance develops .","Topical therapy is a key component of nearly all acne regimens. Topical therapy should be selected to help achieve medical adherence. Realistic expectations of therapy should be explained. Combining therapies or using fixed combination topical products improves efficacy by targeting more than one pathogenic feature and enhancing treatment adherence. Topical antibiotics can lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance. Topical antibiotics should not be used as single agents for the treatment of acne. Topical retinoids are useful as first-line agents. Any regimen containing an antibiotic (topical or oral), including a topical antibiotic/retinoid combination should be combined with benzoyl peroxide to reduce and prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of P. acnes."
9781910797273,chp2,"MS is characterized by the presence of multifocal lesions or 'plaques', predominantly in the white matter, which exhibit myelin destruction, perivascular inflammation and relative preservation of axons . The condition is traditionally regarded as a T-cell-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease, initiated outside the central nervous system (CNS) by loss of tolerance to one, or a number of, CNS antigen(s) . In early disease most patients have small circumscribed lesions that typically occur in the periventricular and subcortical white matter, corpus callosum, optic nerves, cerebellum and spinal cord (Figure 2.1) . Nowadays, more diffuse white matter pathology and early gray matter lesions are being seen using new MRI techniques, as well as in pathological studies . Although disease may be macroscopically confined to the white matter, careful neuropathological evaluation reveals focal cortical and deep gray matter lesions in almost all patients with MS (Figure 2.2) . The hallmark of the acute MS lesion is the abrupt appearance of large numbers of activated microglia and macrophages, outnumbering lymphocytes by at least 10-20 times, in concert with the start of myelin breakdown and focal disruption of the blood-brain barrier . Active lesions, which predominate in early relapsing MS, are defined pathologically by the presence of partially myelinated axons in tissue infiltrated by macrophages . In the most widely accepted paradigm, phagocytic activity is directed by myelin-specific T cells in perivascular cuffs and, in lesser numbers, diffusely infiltrating the parenchyma within such lesions . This hypothesis has been challenged by the neuropathological interrogation of ultra-acute (newly forming) MS lesions, which are characterized by extensive loss of oligodendrocytes without significant T-cell infiltrates . The periplaque white matter is the zone immediately surrounding acute and chronic MS lesions, and is characterized by the presence of activated microglia (which may form specific elongated 'nodules' or aggregates; Figure 2.5), perivascular T-cell cuffs and proliferating oligodendrocytes . Recovery from relapses is in part mediated by remyelination, the process by which denuded axons are enveloped by new myelin sheaths (Figures 2.6 and 2.7) . These myelinating cells are derived from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which must migrate from the periplaque white matter and mature before commencing the process of axon ensheathment . Although remyelination is the default response to demyelination in early relapsing disease, the process progressively fails with advancing disease and age in many patients . Although myelin appears to be 'targeted' in MS lesions, focal and diffuse axonal loss is present in the white matter of patients with relapsing and progressive forms of the disease (see pages 26 -) . Diffuse white matter axonal loss becomes most prominent in longstanding disease, and is accompanied by diffuse activation of microglia and the presence of scattered perivascular T-cell cuffs . While MS is traditionally regarded as a white matter disease, prominent demyelination, neuro-axonal injury and loss of synapses are present in the cortex and deep gray matter of patients with longstanding disease and underpin the cognitive and, to a lesser extent, motor dysfunction that characterizes this phase of the condition . Concordant with this finding, neuroimaging studies indicate that brain volume loss preferentially occurs in the gray matter in early relapsing MS .","Early relapsing MS is a multifocal inflammatory demyelinating and degenerative disease that affects both the white and gray matter. MS leads to a diffuse change in the white matter, which explains the brain atrophy that occurs early in the disease course. Although still considered to be an organ-specific autoimmune disease, loss of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes in newly forming MS lesions is a critical event that may trigger or amplify the inflammatory cascade that characterizes active demyelination. Resolution of inflammation, restoration of axonal impulse propagation and remyelination mediate recovery from discrete clinical relapses in early disease. Molecular reorganization of demyelinated axon membranes, characterized by a greater than normal sodium channel density, permits the restoration of continuous impulse propagation in non-remyelinated fibers. As the disease advances, the pathological complexity of MS increases. Multifocal adaptive inflammation is progressively replaced by a diffuse 'degenerative' phase, although these two facets of MS neuropathology are probably inextricably linked. Current therapies effectively target the inflammatory pathology that peaks in early disease but, until recently, have failed to arrest the progression of established 'neurodegeneration' or promote endogenous repair mechanisms such as remyelination; we are on the cusp of a new era in MS therapies, with the first remyelination study showing positive effects."
9781908541963,chapter1,"Patients with acute liver disease typically have no previous history of liver injury . Acute liver injuries (exempli gratia viral hepatitis, exposure to a toxin or medication) typically resolve once the offending agent is removed or the viral infection resolves, and usually there are no sequelae . Occasionally, however, liver injury is so severe that the patient does not have enough hepatocytes remaining to allow for homeostasis - a condition called fulminant hepatic failure or acute liver failure (see page 24) . Medications may also cause liver disease, so it is important to determine which medications a patient is taking, and particularly those temporally related to the development of the liver disorder . Elevated levels of enzymes of hepatocellular origin, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), suggest injury to hepatocytes . Elevations in alkaline phosphatase suggest injury to the function or structure of the biliary system . Both AST and ALT are released from injured hepatocytes, and elevated levels are found in the blood of patients with liver disease of diverse etiologies . However, it has long been established that injury to the bile ducts, whether the extrahepatic bile ducts or the microscopic canaliculi that course through the liver, results in elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in the blood . Patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase of hepatic origin usually have symptoms or signs of liver disease or other hepatic abnormalities on biochemical screening . In contrast, patients with elevated alkaline phosphatase of bone origin may complain of bone pain or may be diagnosed with Paget's disease or have a known malignancy . GGT levels can also be useful in the diagnosis of ALD, as GGT is rapidly inducible by alcohol and often reaches impressive elevations in patients with even mild alcoholic liver injury . As with the aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase levels do not necessarily correlate with the severity of liver injury or dysfunction . Prothrombin time (PT) and albumin and bilirubin levels are better measures of liver function . Measurement of the serum bilirubin concentration is perhaps the most important test of liver function . Injury of liver cells (exempli gratia in hepatitis or cirrhosis) is another cause of elevated bilirubin levels . Both acute and chronic liver disease may result in hyperbilirubinemia that is usually predominantly of the conjugated fraction . An important clue to the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is otherwise normal liver function, id est normal albumin concentration, PT, aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase levels . Ultrasonography is particularly useful for examining the hepatic parenchyma for abnormalities (exempli gratia tumors or other space-occupying lesions) and the biliary tree for dilation induced by distal obstruction . A liver biopsy usually allows a definitive diagnosis of the underlying liver disorder and staging of the disease (severity of permanent liver injury; fibrosis; cirrhosis) . An elevated GGT level is particularly common, with levels up to five times the upper limit of normal, usually with a lesser degree of abnormality in alkaline phosphatase . Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is another explanation for this pattern of abnormal liver function tests .","Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase suggest injury to hepatocytes. An elevated level of alkaline phosphatase suggests injury to structures of the biliary tree. Prothrombin time (after vitamin K) and serum albumin are used to assess the liver's ability to synthesize proteins. Increases in serum bilirubin occur for many reasons, but generally indicate severe disease. A liver biopsy is the gold standard for evaluation of liver disease."
9781905832729,ch_2,"A complete description of the anatomy of the urinary system is beyond the scope of this book and is of limited interest to the general healthcare professional . However, particular aspects of the anatomy and function of the urinary tract are relevant to understanding bladder disorders and should be familiar to anyone working in the field . The relevant anatomy of the urinary system is shown in Figure 1.1 . The term 'internal sphincter' is often used and refers to the smooth muscle of the bladder neck and proximal urethra . Control of the internal sphincter is involuntary . The term 'external sphincter' or 'external urethral sphincter' refers to the striated muscle that surrounds the proximal urethra and is under voluntary control . Some striated muscle also forms part of the urethra for a variable distance from the bladder neck . The entire striated sphincter complex is often referred to as the 'rhabdosphincter' . Continence is maintained by a complex interaction between the bladder, the urethra, the pelvic floor muscles, the endopelvic fascia and the nervous system . The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system, pressure increasing slowly and steadily as the bladder fills, normally at a rate of 0.5-5 mL/minute . Continence is maintained as long as the urethral pressure exceeds the bladder pressure . During normal voiding, voluntary relaxation of the striated musculature in and around the urethra precedes contraction of the detrusor (bladder) muscle . The bladder neck and proximal urethra (often referred to as the 'bladder outlet') become funnel shaped . This relaxation/contraction combination reduces outflow resistance and increases intravesical (in the bladder) pressure, causing the bladder to be emptied forcibly . Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord and the micturition center in the midbrain . The sacral reflex center is situated in S2 to S4, and the pelvic nerve and its branches lead from here to the detrusor muscle . Excitation of these nerves stimulates the release primarily of acetylcholine, which acts on muscarinic receptors to cause detrusor contraction . During normal bladder filling, there is no excitatory input from the micturition center in the brain to the sacral micturition center or from the sacral micturition center to the pelvic nerves . There is a gradual increase in the tone of the external sphincter (striated muscle), mediated through impulses via the pudendal nerve . Voiding depends on coordinated excitation of the sacral parasympathetic nerves and simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary); continence requires the converse (Table 1.1) . Storage and voluntary emptying of the bladder are also influenced by psychological and sociocultural factors . Using a toilet away from home can cause psychological stress, suppression of the desire to void and infrequent voiding . Voiding position and posture (exempli gratia squatting or sitting) used by women to empty the bladder differs by cultures or by health status . Negative perceptions of the physical environment of toilets can alter toileting stance or suppress the desire to void . Anatomy and function of the urinary system .","The bladder operates as a low-pressure high-volume system. Urine storage and voiding are controlled by reflex centers in the spinal cord, the micturition center in the midbrain and the somatic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Voiding requires a coordinated contraction of the detrusor (bladder smooth musculature), simultaneous opening of the bladder outlet (involuntary) and relaxation of the external urethral sphincter (voluntary). Continence requires the converse."
9781908541666,ch_2,"National data have demonstrated an alarming increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the developed world . According to the US 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet, the prevalence of diabetes in the US population is 8.3%, with estimates ranging from 5.8% in Vermont to 11.3% in Mississippi . Data from Diabetes UK reveals that 4.45% of the UK population had diabetes in 2011, equating to 2.9 million people . With increasing urbanization in India there has been an explosive increase in the prevalence of diabetes, which has now reached 8.0%, with 50 million people with type 2 diabetes . It is clear that, of the 219 countries and territories monitored by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), some nations have substantially higher rates of diabetes . Data from the IDF's 2013 Diabetes Atlas show the highest national prevalence of diabetes in adults in selected Pacific Islands, including Tokelau, Micronesia, the Marshall islands, Kiribati, the Cook islands and Vanuatu, followed by Saudi Arabia (Table 1.1) . According to the IDF, diabetes caused 5.1 million deaths globally in 2013 - approximately 6% of total world mortality . Data for deaths attributable to diabetes according to world regions are shown in Figure 1.2 . Globally, most people with diabetes are in the age range 40-59 years, a time in which productivity at work and contribution to family life is anticipated . IDF data show that preventable complications of diabetes account for an additional 23 million years of life lost through disability and reduced quality of life . Data extrapolations suggest the prevalence will continue to rise steeply and that by 2035, 592 million people will be affected . The IDF has identified several reasons for the steep increase anticipated in diabetes prevalence: overweight and obesity, unhealthy eating, sedentary lifestyles, urbanization and an aging population . In terms of the population-based burden of diabetes, China has the highest number of people affected, based on 2013 data collected by the IDF, followed by India and the USA (Table 1.2) . Rapid changes in lifestyle associated with westernization have led to large increases in the prevalence of diabetes throughout Asia . People of Asian descent develop diabetes at lower degrees of obesity and at younger ages . There are also data to suggest Asian people suffer longer from diabetes complications and die earlier than people in other regions . An accelerating factor appears to be childhood obesity, which is increasing at alarming rates in Asia . Inevitably, people with type 1 diabetes who cannot access insulin die . Type 1 diabetes develops in about 79 000 children under the age of 14 every year . Recent data indicate the rate of new cases of type 1 diabetes is increasing by 3% every year, promoted by, among other factors, escalating rates of childhood obesity . About 25% of all cases of type 1 diabetes are in South East Asia, with about 20% in Europe . Rates of type 1 diabetes also appear to be increasing in eastern European countries . The rate of type 2 diabetes is also increasing in children, though more data are required .","The prevalence of diabetes is increasing around the world, reflecting the massive societal changes in dietary habits, with energy overconsumption, an increase in sedentary lifestyle and obesity. Different ethnic groups are particularly susceptible to diabetes. The obesity epidemic is impacting on earlier development of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The impact of diabetes and its complications will have the greatest burden on resource-poor nations with limited access to insulin and renal replacement (dialysis and transplantation)."
9781912776696,hh-9,"Table 6.1 shows summary statistics (where n is the number of subjects and x̅ is the mean fall in total cholesterol over the treatment period) for each of three age groups: < 50, 50 to < 60 and >= 60 years . Adjusting for the imbalances in age across the treatment groups has produced a statistically significant difference . For a binary endpoint (exempli gratia responder versus non-responder), the data can be broken down according to categories of the factor that needs adjustment, calculating the proportions of events in each treatment group in each factor category . For example, to adjust for three baseline factors - age (< 50 vs 50 to < 60 vs >= 60), sex (male vs female) and baseline risk (ECOG 1 vs ECOG 2) - the data would need to be broken down into 12 (3 x 2 x 2) categories (strata), but there may not be any patients in the active treatment group who are, say, under 50 years, male and ECOG 1 . For example, in patients with lung cancer, is time to disease progression (the dependent variable) affected by the size of the primary tumor at baseline (the independent variable) (Figure 6.1)? Having considered the dependence of an outcome (time to disease progression) on a single baseline factor (size of primary tumor at baseline), this approach can be extended to look simultaneously at the dependence on multiple baseline factors . For example, evaluating the dependence of time to disease progression (y) on three baseline factors rather than one: size of primary tumor (x), age (x) and sex (x) . A simple regression analysis, with age as the single baseline factor, could well give a significant p -value suggesting a dependence, but this would be misleading . Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is used to compare treatment groups while accounting for baseline imbalances . Figure 6.4 is a scatter plot showing the relationship between time to disease progression and the size of the primary tumor (the covariate) in two groups (active treatment versus control [placebo]), each comprising 20 subjects . As can be seen in Figure 6.4, there are patients in the active treatment group with large tumors whose outcomes are poor (time to disease progression of 15 months or less) . An alternative way of comparing the two treatment groups would be to exploit the dependence of time to disease progression on size of primary tumor . The vertical distance between the lines (c) is 5.94, suggesting that, on average and irrespective of baseline tumor size, the active treatment extends time to disease progression by almost 6 months . This method provides a treatment comparison based on the value of c and its associated p -value, adjusting for baseline imbalances in size of primary tumor, age and sex . Thus, the experimental treatment offers, on average, 5.55 months longer to disease progression than the control and this benefit does not depend on the size of the primary tumor at baseline . According to this model, patients who present with size of primary tumor = x will have mean time to disease progression = a + bx .","A stratified analysis (analysis of variance; ANOVA) gives a treatment effect, adjusting for baseline imbalances for continuous and score endpoints. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test compares treatments, adjusting for baseline imbalances for a binary endpoint, while the stratified logrank test does the same for a time-to-event endpoint. Linear regression (univariate analysis) and multiple regression (multivariate analysis) investigate the dependence of an outcome on baseline factors. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is an extension of ANOVA that can adjust for continuous covariates and for several covariates simultaneously when comparing treatments. ANCOVA can also be used to investigate treatment x covariate interactions. These statistical models can be incorporated into a single modeling framework that models the mean for continuous and score endpoints. Patient-to-patient variation is assumed to follow a normal distribution. The logistic model provides a corresponding framework for binary endpoints that models the odds for the event. The Cox model provides a corresponding framework for time-to-event endpoints that models the hazard rate."
9781908541420,ch_3,"The IgE produced by the stimulated B lymphocytes binds to mast cells and, possibly, other cells involved in inflammation (exempli gratia eosinophils), leading to the release of inflammatory mediators . This may be important as MC TC are more dependent on stem cell factor (ckit ligand) from mesenchymal and epithelial cells and less responsive to Th2 cytokines and programmed cell death induced by corticosteroids . It may also, in part, account for the increased morbidity from respiratory viruses in asthma that occurs at certain times of the year, id est when respiratory viruses such as those causing the common cold in winter months (exempli gratia rhinoviruses) are prevalent . Patients with asthma show an enhanced airway narrowing (bronchoconstrictor) response to a variety of stimuli such as histamine and methacholine (which act directly on airway smooth muscle), and exercise, hypertonic stimuli (exempli gratia saline, mannitol), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and cold or dry air (which act indirectly), causing bronchoconstriction secondary to the release of inflammatory mediators largely from primed mast cells . Acute bronchoconstriction may occur as a result of allergen-induced release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, prostaglandins and leukotrienes . The most important factor predisposing to most asthma is atopy, which is characterized by excessive IgE production in response to common environmental allergens (exempli gratia from dust mites, animals, pollens and fungi) . There is some evidence that these differences are due to differences in allergen sensitivity and airway responsiveness between the sexes, although the differential effects of hormones and lung growth at puberty may also lead to changes in asthma prevalence . While no single gene has been identified as being causative for asthma, several genetic loci have been associated with increased asthma risk, particularly in certain environments resulting in a gene-environment interaction . These findings are sometimes referred to as the 'hygiene hypothesis', which attributes the rising prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases to a failure in immune maturation caused by the relative protection from bacterial infection and changed gut bacterial flora in the first few years of life that are associated with a western lifestyle . Lack of bacterial stimulation of the immature immune system leads to impaired production of regulatory T-cells and enhancement of Th2 and Th1 responses causatively linked to allergy and autoimmune disease, respectively . In early childhood, inhaled allergens and infection appear to be important causal factors for asthma . In adults, cigarette smoking and exposure to occupational allergens are more likely to be important causal factors . Among the most common causes of drug-induced asthma are acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which have been described as triggering asthma attacks in 4-28% of asthmatic patients . Passive exposure is an important early-life risk factor for asthma, impairing lung growth and encouraging allergic responses in early infancy . The role of particular infections, such as rhinoviruses, as a cause of asthma in early life, is becoming increasingly well established, particularly in association with allergen exposure . Trigger factors can induce asthma by causing inflammation, provoking bronchial hyperresponsive airways to contract or both .","Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition of the conducting airways. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of airflow limitation which, depending on the severity of the attack, can cause breathlessness, wheezing, chest tightness, cough and, rarely, death Structural changes also occur in the airways; these are particularly evident in those with severe and chronic asthma. The structural abnormalities in asthma include thickened basement membrane, mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and mast cells within the airway smooth muscle. Airway inflammation in people with asthma is not uniform: in most it is eosinophil predominant, but in others neutrophil cell types predominate. The most prominent risk factors are allergen exposure in genetically susceptible individuals and maternal cigarette smoking. Genetic factors determine susceptibility to environmental factors, and it is the interaction between these that leads to clinical disease."
9783318066241,ch4,"One in every three patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) will develop moderate-to-severe disease and there has been great interest in methods for determining which patients may be at risk of a worse prognosis . Predictors of severity can also identify patients who may benefit from contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) to detect local complications . While attempts to predict the severity of AP should be made early in the course of disease, ultimately severity should be classified at discharge as mild, moderate or severe according to the presence or absence of local and systemic complications during the course of disease . Comorbidity and obesity are important factors associated with an increased risk of persistent organ failure (OF) and mortality . Although initial symptoms are of no use for predicting severity, the following signs on early physical examination are associated with a higher probability of adverse outcomes . Signs of pleural effusion are common on pulmonary auscultation in patients with moderate-to-severe AP, particularly on the left side; pleural effusion on imaging in the emergency room has also been associated with a worse prognosis . Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) detected in the emergency room and/or a subsequent increase in BUN in the first 24 hours is associated with an increased risk of persistent OF and mortality . Local complications are associated with worse outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality (due to their association with SIRS and persistent OF) . However, CECT is associated with radiation exposure, so its use is inappropriate in patients with an obvious diagnosis of AP and predicted mild disease . CECT should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis and those who have predicted severe disease, persistent SIRS, the presence of signs or symptoms suggesting local complications (inability to resume oral feeding, persistent pain, palpable mass, fever, etc . Two historically important scoring systems - the Balthazar score and the CT score (Table 4.1) - have been developed for assessing the severity of local complications in AP on the basis of findings on CT imaging . Most patients with local complications develop SIRS, and only patients with systemic inflammation are at risk of OF . It has been extensively reported that having SIRS (>= SIRS criteria; Figure 4.1) is associated with a worse prognosis, and persistent (>= 48 hours) SIRS is particularly associated with increased morbidity and mortality . Approximately 30% of patients have SIRS criteria at admission; almost half of them will develop transient or persistent OF . Persistent OF is a marker of severe disease and is associated with maximum morbidity and a high risk of mortality (52% according to a large prospective cohort study), whereas transient OF is associated with increased morbidity but a low rate of mortality (7%) . The ideal scoring system should make an early (at admission or within the first 24 hours) prediction of severity and should be accurate . In general, the predictors of severity have a high negative predictive value (as most patients will develop only mild disease) but a low-to-moderate positive predictive value .","Comorbidity and obesity are baseline characteristics associated with worse outcomes. Early increases in serum blood urea nitrogen or hematocrit are associated with worse outcomes. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, particularly when persistent (>= 48 hours), is associated with an increased frequency of local and systemic complications. In general, scoring systems for predicting severity have a high negative predictive value and a low-to-moderate positive predictive value."
9781908541727,ch05,"Red eye, blurred vision and double vision are all common and important eye symptoms . However, you should also listen carefully to the patient for the presence of other symptoms that may indicate serious eye disease . A combination of new-onset flashing lights and and new-onset floaters signals a higher likelihood of a retinal tear or detachment . Patients with migraine often see flashing or sparkling lights before the onset of their headache; sometimes they experience these symptoms without their usual headache (acephalgic migraine) . Flashing lights that are not the prodrome of migraine are most commonly due to an age change in the vitreous called posterior vitreous detachment, in which the vitreous jelly pulls away from the retina . The resultant minor retinal traction causes retinal neurons to fire, and the patient then sees flashing lights . However, in a minority of patients the flashing lights are caused by significant retinal traction resulting in a retinal tear or detachment, which requires urgent laser or surgical treatment . However, new-onset floaters (gray, black or red spots, cobwebs or blobs) can be due to a retinal tear, retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, and require urgent assessment . Table 5.1 outlines the different types of visual field defect in terms of how they are perceived by the patient, the anatomic site at which they occur and the causes of each type of defect . Persisting visual field loss is always due to serious eye, optic nerve or brain disease . Some patients will spontaneously mention that their vision is bad only in a certain area (exempli gratia only out to the side) in one or both eyes . Others will realize (if you ask them) that their blurred vision is only in part of the visual field (Figure 5.1), and some patients may be asymptomatic and the field defect only noted on examination . Transient visual field loss . Transient binocular homonymous field loss may occur as part of the migraine prodrome . This is usually a slowly expanding visual field defect surrounded by flashing lights or zig-zag lines (a scintillating scotoma) (Figure 5.2) . Transient homonymous visual field loss (usually without flashing lights) may also occur in vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) . Transient visual field loss in one eye is likely to be amaurosis fugax . Visual distortion (metamorphopsia) is almost always a symptom of macular (central retinal) disease (Figure 5.3) . Photophobia (sensitivity to light) can be the earliest symptom of iritis, before the eye becomes red or the vision becomes blurred . It is therefore important to ask any patient over 50 who has headaches or visual symptoms specifically whether they have any of the symptoms of temporal arteritis described in Table 5.2 . Even if no visual symptoms are present initially, patients with untreated temporal arteritis can suddenly go permanently blind in one or both eyes, usually from anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . If, however, the disease is suspected early, and the patient is referred urgently and is treated with high-dose steroids, visual loss and life-threatening complications can usually be prevented .",Any of the following symptoms require urgent ophthalmic referral:- flashing lights (other than the visual prodrome of migraine)- new-onset floating spots- visual field loss- visual distortion- photophobia (sensitivity to light)- pain in the eye (even if vision is normal and the eye is not red)- symptoms of temporal arteritis (if the patient is over 50). A combination of flashing lights and floating spots may indicate a retinal tear or detachment. Visual distortion is almost always a symptom of serious macular disease. Photophobia or eye pain may indicate early iritis or acute glaucoma. Urgent referral of patients with symptoms of temporal arteritis could save their sight or their life. - flashing lights (other than the visual prodrome of migraine) - new-onset floating spots - visual field loss - visual distortion - photophobia (sensitivity to light) - pain in the eye (even if vision is normal and the eye is not red) - symptoms of temporal arteritis (if the patient is over 50).
9781910797693,chp5,"For example a biosimilar of adalimumab was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2017; however, the European patent of adalimumab-Humira TM doesn't expire until the last quarter of 2018, indicating that the product may not be available until early in 2019 . Figure 5.1 illustrates the broad variation in the uptake of different classes of biosimilars across Europe . Gaining the confidence of clinicians to start new patients on biosimilars, and to switch patients during treatment, is crucial to creating a competitive market . In 2016, a survey of specialist clinicians in the USA found that 45% believed that biosimilars would be safe for use in new and existing patients; this proportion ranged from 34% to 57% depending on specialty (Table 5.4) . If, however, clinicians are unwilling to switch patients to biosimilars, pharmacies are forced to stock multiple brands of the same drug and therefore forgo much of the potential economic gain . Such a program at a single hospital reported savings of £40 000-60 000 per month (€45 000-68 000 [US$52 000-77 000]) realized from switching 143 patients with inflammatory bowel disease to biosimilar infliximab . Recognition that switching from biologics to biosimilars, whilst potentially problematic, is crucial to the economic benefit of biosimilars, prompted an unprecedented intervention in 2017 by some of Europe's national drug regulators . This was based on three factors: the high analytic similarity of biosimilars to originator drugs; no evidence of a difference in drug immunogenicity; and the wealth of clinical trial data available from over a decade of biosimilar use . Even though biosimilars have relatively high prices compared with small molecule drugs, their introduction has served to improve patient access through the resultant cost savings that can be realized . For example, when the London Medicines Procurement Programme introduced biosimilar versions of filgrastim (recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF], a white cell growth factor used to minimize the risk of neutropenia [low neutrophil cell count], and therefore infection, during cancer chemotherapy), the number of patients treated increased five-fold, driven by the lower price compared with the original brand . When biosimilar filgrastim was introduced in New Zealand in 2012, national audits confirmed both increased patient access and improved outcomes for the overall patient population . These examples illustrate that the introduction of biosimilars can increase patient access, allowing more patients to be treated from the same budget . Competitive pricing of biosimilars compared with the reference products also improves patient access . A 2017 report for the EU reported that list prices for key drug classes in 2016 were 7-37% lower than in the year before approval of the biosimilar (Table 5.6) . However, in a subsequent appraisal in 2014 (TA323), prices were taken from the tender bids placed for contracts to supply epoetins to the London Medicines Procurement Programme; as a result of the competition created by biosimilars, NICE approved use of these drugs in the NHS . A policy of optimising biosimilar use and creating competition between manufacturers to drive price reductions is predicted to save €50-100 billion over 5 years in the EU M5 markets and the USA (see Figure 2.1) .","Four generations of biosimilar have been developed, from the simple hormone replacement molecules to complex monoclonal antibodies used for chronic inflammatory disorders and cancer, and more than 30 are now approved in the EU, but only six in the USA. There has been no indication that the biosimilars have any meaningful difference in safety or efficacy from their originator biologics, based on more than 700 million patient-days' exposure to European-approved biosimilars over the last 10 years. Uptake of biosimilars has varied by therapy area and geography, ranging from 1% to 90%; some surveys report persistent concerns among clinicians about the interchangeability and substitution of biosimilars. The introduction of the biosimilar filgrastim led to a dramatic increase in use whilst realizing cost savings because fewer patients required treatment for neutropenia; it also drove down the price of a long-acting version of filgrastim that was still patent protected. Managed programs in which savings from switching could be reinvested in staffing have realized substantial savings. Competitive pricing has also reversed health technology assessments for erythropoietins by improving the cost-effectiveness of treatment."
9781908541666,ch_6,"Less common forms of diabetes mellitus may present with symptoms similar to those of type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but can have a number of diverse causes (Table 5.1) . Monogenic forms of diabetes mellitus . Monogenic forms of diabetes account for 1-2% of diabetes . These forms of diabetes result from mutations affecting the genes that regulate beta cell function . It is important to consider these forms of diabetes, as their treatment requirements can differ and they can be misclassified as type 1 or 2 diabetes . Monogenic diabetes is generally characterized by the onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (under 25 years) without ketoacidosis . The family history is usually positive for diabetes in two to three generations, which should raise the suspicion . Monogenic diabetes should be considered as a cause in these children if there is a family history of diabetes . The commonest forms of monogenic diabetes are listed in Table 5.2 . Individuals diagnosed before the age of 6 months are more likely to have monogenic diabetes than autoimmune beta cell destruction (type 1 diabetes) . This form of monogenic diabetes is best treated with oral sulfonylurea medication rather than insulin . Mutations in the glucokinase gene results in familial mild fasting hyperglycemia (MODY2) . There is often a strong family history of diabetes and the onset of hyperglycemia before the age of 25 years . This is the commonest form of monogenic diabetes, accounting for about 58% of cases . Microvascular complications in this form of monogenic diabetes are predicted by glycemic control, just as for type 1 and type 2 diabetes . Interestingly, patients with this mutation appear to be more susceptible to ischemic heart disease, despite having the elevated HDL cholesterol that characterizes the condition . HNF1B (or MODY5) is the most common form of monogenic diabetes due to transcription factor mutation . Again, diagnosis assists in clinical management as this form of diabetes responds to low-dose sulfonylurea therapy . Diabetes mellitus associated with other endocrine diseases . Treatment of the underlying condition usually results in amelioration of the hyperglycemia . Conditions affecting the integrity of the pancreas can damage beta cells and result in hyperglycemia . A patient may already have the diagnosis, as in the case of cystic fibrosis, or a condition such as hemochromatosis can be considered at diagnosis, particularly if there are features of skin pigmentation, hepatomegaly and a history of fatigue and degenerative joint disease . Hyperglycemia can result from a number of drugs that affect either insulin secretion or insulin action . Glucocorticoids can unmask an underlying susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, but can also induce hyperglycemia if used at high enough doses . Pentamidine, a drug used to treat pneumocystis infection in AIDS, is a beta cell toxin that has also been associated with inducing ketosis-prone diabetes that requires ongoing insulin therapy . A number of genetic syndromes that can be associated with diabetes mellitus and other causes, such as infections, are listed in Table 5.1 .","Onset of hyperglycemia without ketoacidosis in non-obese individuals under 25 years of age is suggestive of monogenic diabetes (more commonly referred to as maturity onset diabetes of youth - MODY). A positive family history of diabetes in two to three generations should raise this suspicion. Conditions such as cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis and pancreatic carcinoma can cause hyperglycemia. Glucocorticoids can unmask a susceptibility to type 2 diabetes or cause hyperglycemia at high doses. Anti-HIV drugs increase insulin resistance. Pentamidine can cause ketosis-prone diabetes. Renal, cardiac and lung transplantation increases the risk of diabetes."
9781908541901,ch_5,"The preferred approach to revascularization - percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) - depends on the extent and severity of the lesions as identified by coronary angiography, potential infarct complications, the patient's condition and comorbidities . A long, flexible, soft plastic tube called a guiding catheter is advanced through the sheath over a guidewire . The tip of the guiding catheter is placed at the origin of the coronary artery . The guiding catheter also allows for iodine-based radiopaque dyes to be injected into the coronary artery, so that lesion location and severity can be precisely assessed using real-time radiographic visualization . This enables the cardiologist to estimate the size of the coronary artery and select the type of balloon catheter and coronary guidewire to use . A coronary guidewire, which is an extremely thin wire with a radiopaque flexible tip, is then inserted through the guiding catheter and into the coronary artery . Still using real-time radiographic visualization, the wire is guided through the coronary artery to the site of the stenosis or blockage . Numerous factors affect the decision to use a bare-metal or a drug-eluting stent, including coronary anatomic features, clinical characteristics (exempli gratia diabetes), likely patient adherence to long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), risk of bleeding with prolonged DAPT and the potential need for future surgical or other procedures that would require discontinuation of DAPT . Several randomized clinical trials, which included patients with STEMI, have shown that drug-eluting stents reduce the risk of re-intervention compared with bare-metal stents, without having a significant impact on the risk of stent thrombosis, recurrent MI or death . PCI is associated with superior restoration of myocardial blood flow, lower rates of reinfarction and mortality and less intracranial bleeding than pharmacological intervention with fibrinolytic therapy . However, the radial approach has been increasingly favored in recent years because of potentially important advantages, including lower risk of major vascular complications and major bleeding, reduced length of stay after the procedure, reduced use of resources, and possibly lower mortality in high-risk patients such as those with STEMI . Bleeding at the site of radial access, radial artery injury and occlusion, increased radiation exposure, and the significant learning curve that is required to master the procedure before implementation of the radial approach as the standard method to achieve access in STEMI, are important considerations that need to be addressed when using the radial approach . Coronary artery bypass grafting . Approximately 10% of patients with acute coronary syndromes (STEMI and NSTEMI) undergo CABG during initial hospitalization (Figure 3.2) . For isolated CABG, the patient's heart is usually stopped and surgery is performed using cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross clamping and cardioplegic cardiac arrest (on-pump CABG) . While avoidance of full-dose heparinization, potential hyperfibrinolysis and embolization of debris may reduce the incidence of CABG-related bleeding, particularly when performed during DAPT, stroke and postoperative respiratory complications, off-pump CABG may not be amenable to all stenotic lesions and may lead to repeat revascularizations or PCIs .","The preferred approach to revascularization depends on the extent and severity of the lesions, potential infarct complications and the patient's condition and comorbidities. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with superior restoration of myocardial blood flow, lower rates of reinfarction and mortality and less intracranial bleeding than pharmacological intervention with fibrinolytic therapy. The use of drug-eluting stents is preferred as they reduce the risk of reintervention compared with bare-metal stents.

9781910797815,chp6,"In addition to the clinical risk factors included in the International Scoring Systems, survival in patients with myelofibrosis is affected by the presence of driver mutations in Janus kinase (JAK) 2, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) or calreticulin (CALR) and other molecular factors, although stratification by genetic risk is not currently used in clinical practice . Figure 6.2 illustrates how these expanded risk scoring systems can be used to guide treatment more accurately than existing systems - almost 20% of patients classified as intermediate-2 risk (who would normally be considered for allogeneic stem cell transplantation [SCT]) are classified as low risk according to MIPSS70-Plus . The treatment of myelofibrosis aims to reduce anemia and symptomatic splenomegaly, relieve constitutional symptoms and control extramedullary hematopoiesis (Table 6.2) . Constitutional symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis are believed to result from altered cytokine production, and often respond to ruxolitinib or to the treatment of splenomegaly . In general, JAK inhibitors such as ruxolitinib are considered as first-line treatment for splenomegaly and symptoms in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis, and SCT is an option for high-risk patients with a poor prognosis . Other treatments, used as needed, include cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon (IFN), and treatment to improve anemia, splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis . The most common grade 3/4 adverse events with ruxolitinib in the COMFORT-I and -II studies were thrombocytopenia and anemia, which were generally managed by dose reduction, temporary suspension of treatment, or transfusion . Allogeneic SCT is currently the only potentially curative therapy for myelofibrosis but is associated with significant mortality and morbidity: 1-year mortality rates with conventional conditioning regimens are 15-30%, and 10-30% of patients experience long-term complications such as toxicity from the conditioning regimens, graft-versus-host disease, infections or graft failure . The JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib have largely superseded hydroxyurea as the treatment of choice for symptomatic splenomegaly . Among the 17 patients with myelofibrosis, 12 (71%) showed partial remission, clinical improvement or stable disease, as assessed using the International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment criteria . Splenectomy may be considered for symptomatic splenomegaly that is resistant to drug therapy, but is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality: perioperative mortality rates are 5-10%, and about 50% of patients experience postoperative complications . Comparable response rates with a lower risk of adverse events can be achieved with danazol, which has also been shown to reduce spleen size in up to 20% of patients . Corticosteroids such as prednisone produce response rates of 30-40% in patients with anemia due to myelofibrosis, and may be useful after other therapies have failed . Low-dose thalidomide, lenalidomide or pomalidomide, alone or in combination with corticosteroids, produces response rates of approximately 20%, - and a recent study has reported a median survival of almost 3 years with long-term treatment . Disease- and patient-related dimensions must be considered when monitoring response to treatment in patients with myelofibrosis . Patients receiving JAK2 inhibitors should have regular blood counts in order to manage ruxolitinib-related anemia and thrombocytopenia, spleen measurement, assessment for infection, and assessment of symptoms (using the MPN-SAF-TSS or the MPN 10) .","Myelofibrosis has the most diverse presentation of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and carries the worst prognosis. Approximately 30% of patients are asymptomatic initially but all patients eventually develop symptoms of bone marrow failure and progressive splenomegaly. The aims of treatment include reduction of anemia and splenomegaly and alleviation of constitutional symptoms. Risk stratification is currently based on the International Progression Scoring System (IPSS) or Dynamic IPSS but new systems that incorporate genetic and cytogenetic risk factors, such as the Mutation-Enhanced International Prognostic Score System (MIPSS70) and MIPSS70-Plus are being developed. Anemia can be treated in the short term with androgens, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and immunomodulators, but most patients eventually become transfusion-dependent. Splenomegaly can be managed using cytoreductive agents, splenectomy, radiation therapy or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. Approximately 80% of patients treated with hydroxyurea will require additional therapy within about 1 year.- Splenectomy is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity but may be an option for patients with drug-resistant splenomegaly. The JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is indicated as first-line therapy in patients with splenomegaly or constitutional symptoms. Low-dose fractionated radiotherapy is the current standard of care for extramedullary hematopoiesis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is potentially curative but is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity and is therefore reserved for high-risk patients, possibly those who are transfusion dependent or who have an unfavorable karyotype. Treatment response should be monitored by blood counts, assessment of symptoms using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-Symptoms Assessment Form Total Symptom Score, and objective measurement of spleen volume. - Splenectomy is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity but may be an option for patients with drug-resistant splenomegaly."
9781910797662,ch03,"The classic presenting sign or symptom of a bladder tumor is painless gross or microscopic hematuria; it is the sole presenting symptom in 60-80% of patients . Unfortunately, and despite the well-known sinister implications of this finding, many patients who present with hematuria are not evaluated further or referred to a urologist . Up to 20% of patients with bladder cancer will not have hematuria at presentation . Significant microscopic hematuria is defined as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on a properly collected urine sample, in the absence of a benign cause . Abnormal dipstick hematuria results should be confirmed by microscopic examination . Microscopic hematuria may be part of the spectrum of painless hematuria; however, the sensitivity and specificity of a single urinalysis is low for detection of bladder cancer . Irritative symptoms such as dysuria, increased frequency and urgency are often dismissed because they are common, are usually due to urinary tract infection (UTI) and are typically not associated with serious disease . However, if infection is absent or symptoms persist after the UTI has been treated, the possibility of an underlying bladder malignancy must be considered and the patient referred to a urologist . Irritative symptoms are particularly common in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), and suprapubic pain when the bladder is full can also be caused by carcinoma of the bladder . Urinalysis in patients with irritative symptoms due to CIS or invasive cancer will usually reveal the presence of red or white blood cells . Patients sometimes present with systemic symptoms due to advanced carcinoma of the bladder . Loin pain can be caused by ureteric obstruction due to an invasive bladder tumor (Figure 3.1) . Although it is difficult to prove that delay in diagnosis affects prognosis, screening for asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is associated with a shift towards more favorable tumor characteristics of lower stage and grade at diagnosis, and better survival . Presentation by the patient may be delayed because of anxiety about the cause of the symptoms, fear of primary care physicians or hospitals or ignorance of the significance of symptoms . Referral by the primary care physician to a specialist may be delayed because of ignorance of the significance of the symptoms, or limited access to specialist healthcare (waiting times for clinic appointments) . Diagnosis by the specialist may be delayed because of waiting times for investigations, follow-up clinic appointments for results, or cystoscopy . Taken together, these factors mean that the average time from the first symptom to treatment of the bladder tumor varies from a few weeks to more than a year across studies . In an attempt to streamline the diagnosis and treatment of patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer, many hospitals now offer a hematuria clinic at which patients can be seen within a week of referral . Any patient with these symptoms should be referred to a urologist immediately . However, patients sometimes ignore a single episode of hematuria and do not seek advice until the bleeding recurs .","Painless hematuria is the most common presentation of bladder cancer. A single episode of hematuria should prompt urgent referral to a urologist. Unexplained irritative symptoms may be due to bladder cancer, particularly carcinoma in situ. Recurrent infections may indicate an underlying tumor. Delay in treatment adversely affects prognosis. Hematuria clinics allow rapid diagnosis and reduce time to treatment."
9783318066685,ch2,"The genetic material/active substance typically delivered into the defective cell, tissue or organ is one of the following: DNA, messenger (m)RNA, small interfering RNA (siRNA), microRNA (miRNA) or antisense oligonucleotides . Gene addition, where the coding DNA of the affected gene is delivered to cells or a tissue, theoretically provides a therapy that would be applicable to all patients with a disease, irrespective of the mutation they possess . The complementary DNA (cDNA) is generally packaged with a promoter and polyadenylation signal (for termination of transcription) into a viral vector to enhance delivery into cells and provide longevity of expression . Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) technology has led to an advance in the therapeutic potential of endonucleases in genetic disease through the development of base editing, RNA editing and exploitation of the alt-NHEJ pathway to drive targeted integration . Of note here is the potential to use a catalytically inactive Cas protein 9 (Cas9), which normally acts as an RNA-guided endonuclease, tethered to transcriptional activators to upregulate expression of genes that could compensate for the mutated gene . By designing antisense oligonucleotides to mask the exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) motifs of an out-of-frame exon that neighbors a loss-of-function deletion, it is possible to induce the splicing out of the target (mutated) exon so that the reading frame is restored and truncated but partially functional protein is expressed . Besides more efficient and targeted delivery, the added advantages of shRNAs over siRNAs are linked to enhanced specificity and the ability to use promoters to drive inducible expression . Ex vivo gene therapies act to manipulate patients' cells in culture so that the genetic mutation is either repaired or compensated for before their transplantation back into the patients . It is also possible to exploit HSC gene therapy to engineer the cells to increase the therapeutic gene dosage, to specifically target diseased tissues or to become resistant to particular disease-causing pathogens . In vivo gene therapy involves the direct administration of therapeutic agent, usually via a viral vector (see below), to resident cells of the target tissue . The liver tropism displayed by the viral vectors typically used for gene transfer make in vivo targeting of hepatic genetic diseases easier than those associated with other tissues . It is possible to use tissue-specific promoters and/or regulatory elements to drive expression and engineer the tropism displayed by the viral vectors to direct the gene therapy to the disease-affected tissue . As it carries a negative charge, circular double-stranded plasmid DNA (pDNA), which consists of a promoter to drive expression, the transgene of interest and a termination signal, can enter cells in its naked form through non-viral delivery . Non-viral DNA vectors possess several valuable advantages over viral vectors, such as easy scale-up, their ability to carry large genes, low immunotoxicity and the potential for cell-specific targeting through ligand coating of liposomes/polyplexes/nanoparticles . Although significant efforts have been made to improve cellular uptake, and to battle against cellular mechanisms for robust and sustainable transgene expression, DNA vectors nonetheless remain much less effective for therapeutic gene delivery than viral vectors .","Loss-of-function mutations can potentially be repaired through gene addition, exon skipping to restore the transcript reading frame, gene editing and upregulation of compensatory genes. Gain-of-function mutations can potentially be treated genetically through endonuclease-mediated gene editing, RNA interference using small interfering (si)RNA or short hairpin (sh)RNA, and antisense oligonucleotides targeting translation start codons, polyadenylation signals or out-of-frame exons. Ex vivo and in situ in vivo gene therapies are - particularly for eye disorders - associated with enhanced safety and targeted efficacy relative to direct systemic in vivo therapy. Non-viral vector delivery, despite generally having safer outcomes than viral delivery, is limited by transient transgene expression and the need for re-administration, which may lead to accumulated toxicological issues. Viral vector delivery has the advantage of persistence of transgene expression, though there are associated genotoxic and immunologic risks that limit efficacy and patient applicability. Preclinical research is focused on improving the safety profiles and manufacturing costs of viral vectors."
9781908541666,ch_7,"Insulin treatment for type 1 diabetes aims to lower glucose levels in the blood to as near to the normal (non-diabetic) range as possible (Figure 6.1) without causing significant hypoglycemia . In practice, achieving normal blood glucose levels is not possible even with multiple-injection or insulin pump therapy, and achieving near-normal blood glucose values in a 24-hour period poses a formidable challenge to all but a small minority of patients . In addition to the theoretical advantage in terms of blood glucose control, such regimens were further fostered by significant developments in insulin pen delivery devices and the development of modern short- and long-acting insulin analogs . Sometimes the long-acting insulin is injected twice daily, 12 hours apart, to achieve better basal blood glucose control . Basal-bolus regimens have, in recent years, become the most widely used method of insulin administration for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, particularly by younger patients with busy, active and, at times, irregular lives . The flexibility of such regimens allows patients to eat at different times of the day without compromising glycemic control: the bolus insulin is injected when the patient eats to counter the expected post-meal glucose excursion, while glucose levels in the fasted state are kept under control by the long-acting basal insulin . In general, two-thirds of the total daily insulin dose is administered in the morning and one-third in the evening, though the ratio is subject to change according to the pattern of self-monitored blood glucose results . The pump delivers a predetermined basal insulin infusion (the rate of which can be varied during the 24-hour period), supplemented at meal times by a patient-activated bolus of short-acting insulin to provide a prandial boost . Studies consistently demonstrate that CSII treatment of type 1 diabetes produces a slight but significant improvement in blood glucose control compared with basal-bolus regimens using pen devices . CSII therapy is also used successfully by pregnant diabetic women who find difficulty achieving recommended blood glucose targets with conventional subcutaneous insulin regimens . Successful whole-pancreas transplantation has the ability to rid diabetic patients of the daily tedium of subcutaneous insulin injections and, where normal blood glucose levels are obtained, the need to make blood glucose measurements . Patient self-monitoring of blood glucose is necessary to measure the effect of the administered doses of insulin on blood glucose levels . Universal agreement as to how many blood glucose tests a person with insulin-treated diabetes should do to achieve good control is lacking . Patients use the results to determine whether insulin dose adjustment is necessary to reach predetermined targets (such as blood glucose values of 4-7 mmol/L [72-126 mg/dL] before the next meal) or to avoid hypoglycemia . Further to the problems associated with self-monitoring of blood glucose outlined above, HbA 1c measurement has long been the gold standard for the assessment of diabetes control . HbA 1c should be measured every 4-6 months in patients with type 1 diabetes to make judgments about glycemic control and the need for modification of the insulin regimen .",Insulin treatment of type 1 diabetes attempts to keep plasma glucose levels as near normal as possible without causing hypoglycemia. Most young patients are treated with a basal-bolus regimen incorporating rapid-acting insulin analogs at mealtimes and a basal long-acting insulin analog. Twice-daily fixed-mixture regimens may be useful for children and the elderly. Pump therapy is a very effective and safe mode of treatment for some patients. Pancreatic and islet cell transplantation may be offered to highly selected type 1 patients. Insulin therapy confers the need to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. Diabetes control is assessed by regular measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ). Diabetes education programs help diabetic patients to manage their condition more effectively.
9781910797471,ch07,"While successful evidence-based therapy now exists for HF due to LV systolic dysfunction, the search for the 'holy grail' in diastolic HF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) continues . All patients with systolic LV dysfunction, including asymptomatic patients (NYHA class I), should be treated with ACE inhibitors at target doses (Table 7.2) . The CONSENSUS trial was the first study to show prognostic improvement with an ACE inhibitor (enalapril with a target dose of 20 mg twice daily) in patients with NYHA class IV HF . Over the past 25 years, a large number of trials have investigated the effects of beta-blockade in patients with HF and provided clear evidence supporting their use in the context of HF with significant systolic dysfunction . In general, to minimize the small risk of precipitating HF, beta-blockers should be commenced at low doses and up-titrated (every 2 weeks) while ensuring the patient's clinical status remains stable . The COPERNICUS trial randomized 2289 patients with severe (NYHA class IV) HF to carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) or placebo . A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials of selective beta-blockers in reactive airways disease has supported the lack of significant effects on forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV), bronchodilator response to beta-2-receptor stimulation and symptoms . For elderly patients with systolic left-sided HF, the adverse effects of beta-blocker treatment on quality of life need to be balanced against the likely mortality benefits . These agents should be considered in patients who remain symptomatic (NYHA class II-IV) despite appropriate doses of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers . A 'selective' aldosterone antagonist without an anti-androgenic effect, eplerenone, has been found to reduce mortality and hospitalization after MI in patients with reduced LV systolic function and symptoms of HF . The RALES trial randomized 1663 patients with severe HF, who were already receiving an ACE inhibitor, loop diuretic and in most cases digoxin, to spironolactone, 25 mg, or placebo . EMPHASIS trial enrolled 2737 patients with mild HF symptoms (including NYHA class II) to receive eplerenone, 25 mg daily (target dose 50 mg daily) or placebo . Changing from ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy to ARNI should be considered in symptomatic patients (NYHA class II and III) with chronic HFrEF and low LVEF (< 35%) despite initial therapy with a beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor or ARB . on a stable dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB (equivalent to enalapril >= 10 mg/day) and a beta-blocker for >= 4 weeks .

Aldosterone antagonists should be stopped in patients with progressive renal dysfunction, and ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy reviewed .","Medical management of heart failure (HF) with preserved systolic function remains challenging, but in principle should target the underlying cause (exempli gratia blood pressure, coronary ischemia). Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers and aldosterone antagonists are the mainstay of therapy for symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The new angiotensive receptor neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril/valsartan and the selective sodium-potassium channel inhibitor ivabradine should be considered in patients who remain symptomatic despite therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB and beta-blocker. Inotropic agents are used short term in acute cases with severe cardiac dysfunction (cardiogenic shock) and can be supplemented by mechanical circulatory support (exempli gratia intra-aortic balloon pump, left ventricular assist device). Acute HF is a medical emergency and the treatment has to be tailored to the underlying clinical problem (lowering blood pressure in severe hypertension, revascularization in acute myocardial infarction)."
9781908541420,ch_10,"Some people with asthma use this strategy to manage exercise-induced symptoms by undertaking a warm-up to exercise of short, high-intensity exercise bursts . However, in some cases it is important to make a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma so, in the lung function laboratory or for research purposes, exercise-induced asthma can be brought on by a short period (6-8 minutes) of high-intensity exercise of at least 70% of maximum capacity . Mouth breathing and increased ventilation lead to recruitment of the lower airways to warm and humidify inspired air, resulting in progressive evaporation of airway surface fluid and consequent hyperosmolarity of this fluid . In addition, breathing humidified warmed air during exercise has been shown to be protective for the development of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction . Swimming is often recommended as an exercise to people with asthma, as inspiration will occur from the humidified air near the water surface, decreasing the dehydrating stimulus to the lower airways . Although this has not been proven to be a cause in laboratory-induced exercise-induced asthma, increased lower airway exposure to allergens and extremes of environmental changes such as heat and cold may be particularly relevant in elite athletes who spend a large amount of time training with high ventilation, thereby increasing their cumulative exposure to such potential triggers . In addition, it is often difficult to achieve adequately high workloads for very fit individuals, such as athletes, using laboratory exercise equipment . As a consequence of these difficulties, surrogate challenges for exercise-induced asthma have been developed so that a diagnosis can be consistently achieved . Exercise challenge testing is an indirect challenge relying on airway responses to exercise, such as airway drying and cooling, to cause smooth muscle contraction . Because of the difficulties of replicating field exercise in the laboratory to achieve consistency of diagnosis, a number of surrogate challenges for exercise have been developed . A fall in FEV of 10% following the eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation challenge has been adopted by the International Olympic Committee as the preferred criterion for confirmation of an asthma diagnosis in elite athletes . However, some - particularly elite - athletes will have a positive surrogate exercise challenge result despite negative direct airway challenge test results . It is therefore important not to exclude exercise-induced asthma on the basis of a negative direct airway challenge test result . Escalating use of bronchodilator treatments by elite athletes has prompted rulings from the International Olympic Committee so that diagnosis of asthma in elite competition must be confirmed by lung function abnormality or challenge testing . Some elite cold-weather athletes, such as cross-country skiers, are very likely to develop exercise-induced asthma (so called 'skier's asthma') . The diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma in elite athletes must be verified by airway challenges . However, many people with asthma do have asthma symptoms despite regular use of inhaled corticosteroids and may require additional short-acting beta -agonists (SABAs) before exercise to prevent exercise-induced asthma . Non-drug strategies for the treatment of exercise-induced asthma rely on the refractory period that follows induction of airway narrowing with exercise .","Exercise-induced asthma is defined as a transient increase in airway resistance that follows vigorous exercise. It appears to be more common in those with atopy and to be seen more often on exercise in very cold weather. Induction of exercise-induced asthma appears to be protective for further episodes for a period of several hours. Exercise testing or other direct or indirect challenges are used in diagnosis. In elite athletes, direct airway challenges may not reveal exercise-induced asthma, so indirect surrogate challenges must be used to confirm diagnosis."
9781908541062,ch_11,"A 'Trap' is a cytokine inhibitor that uses different high-affinity receptor components to bind the target ligand . A molecule targeting IL-1 ('IL-1 Trap') comprises the extracellular domains of both IL-1 receptor components (type I receptor and receptor accessory protein) linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Ig)G . A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to IL-1 (canakinumab) is also being tested as a therapy for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases . It activates endothelial cells, promoting leukocyte recruitment and activation, and also induces a variety of other inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 . Clinical trials of anti-IL-17 mAbs will determine whether IL-17 inhibition will be as effective as other cytokine inhibitors . In turn, these genes are activated through cascades of signaling molecules . Once activated, JAK3 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the receptor, leading to the recruitment of specific signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) . Clinical trials of JAK inhibitors in patients with RA have yielded encouraging results, both from efficacy and toxicity standpoints . These are chemically synthesized orally bioavailable drugs, which provides a potential advantage over biological therapies . All three of these pathways are of potential pathogenic significance in RA and an orally bioavailable SYK inhibitor is being studied in RA, with encouraging results to date . Gene therapy provides a potential means of overcoming the requirement for daily injections . The main limitations at present are generalized safety issues relating to the use of viral vectors, and the need to identify robust methods for regulating transcription and translation of the therapeutic gene . Therapeutic tolerance refers to methods of switching off unwanted immune responses, usually by targeting the T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) interaction . In animal models, therapeutic tolerance has been possible for many years, allowing organ graft transplantation without immune suppression, and effectively providing a cure for autoimmunity . Translation to the clinic has been slow, but over recent years there have been major advances both in the application of tolerogenic therapies, and in their monitoring . For example, the use of non-activating anti-CD3 mAbs in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes has effectively delayed disease progression for up to 4 years . A number of cellular therapies are also being developed as potential tolerogenic agents . These include purified and expanded regulatory T cells, tolerogenic dendritic cells and mesenchymal stem cells which, in addition to their tissue engineering potential (see below), also have powerful immunomodulatory properties . Clinical trials of many therapies have demonstrated optimal results in early disease and attention is starting to turn to the preclinical phase of RA for two reasons . These include DNA silencing by methylation, and transcriptional modification of genes by histone acetylation . Another important influence comes from microRNAs, which are genome-encoded small RNA molecules that influence the transcription and translation of genes . A number of important epigenetic modifications have been linked to human disease and, importantly, these processes are readily targetable . Numerous novel potential targets for biological as well as oral therapies are currently under investigation .","A large number of drugs are currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); several target novel mediators and pathways, incorporating concepts such as epigenetic modification. Signaling pathway inhibitors are orally active drugs with potencies similar to biological therapies. Their successful passage through phase III trials could have a major impact on RA management. Mesenchymal stem cells have both immunomodulatory and tissue engineering potential. They could develop into an important cellular therapy for diseases such as RA. In the future, rheumatologists may identify and treat patients in the presymptomatic phase of RA, using approaches such as therapeutic tolerance induction."
9781908541086,ch_6,"The American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, (DSM-IV) criteria for anorexia and bulimia are highlighted in Tables 4.2 and 4.3, respectively . In the alternative diagnostic classification used in Europe - the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision (ICD-10) - eating disorders belong to a wider category entitled 'Behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors' . DSM-IV gives precedence to anorexia over bulimia, while the ICD-10 specifically excludes a diagnosis for anorexia if binge eating is present . The suggested changes include: the removal of the amenorrhea criterion for anorexia; the listing of binge-eating disorder as a stand-alone diagnosis; and a frequency criterion of at least once a week (rather than twice a week) for binge eating and/or inappropriate compensatory behaviors in the diagnosis of bulimia or binge-eating disorder (www . Although a straightforward and comprehensive clinical interview is the best way to diagnose an eating disorder, a medical examination is necessary to determine whether the symptoms observed in the patient are a result of a bio-organic or psychosocial disease . Medical causes of weight loss other than eating disorders are . Patients with bulimia often have features of depression, especially low self-esteem, and may have features of anxiety (30-70% present with depression or anxiety during their lifetime compared with a lifetime rate in the general population of 9% and 11% for mood disorders and anxiety disorders, respectively) . Many of the physical signs and abnormalities associated with bulimia are due to recurrent vomiting (Table 4.7) and are more likely to be seen in patients with purging-type bulimia (see Classification, 1 . Cardiac complications usually arise because of nutrition- and hydration- induced electrolyte imbalance, which is pronounced in bulimia but can also occur in anorexia . Although these are common symptoms and behavioral indicators of eating disorders, most female athletes do not meet the standard criteria for anorexia or bulimia . Notably, men with an eating disorder - particularly bulimia or binge-eating disorder - may be more likely to have a substance-abuse problem . body dissatisfaction experienced by these patients is usually reinforced by the encouragement of weight-loss behaviors, even if these are unhealthy . Physicians should actively screen obese patients for eating disorders, and should encourage healthy eating practices, gradual weight loss and moderation in prescribed lifestyle changes (see Fast Facts: Obesity) . Although diabetes, particularly type 2, is more prevalent in men, comorbidity of eating disorders and diabetes is seen mostly in women . Primary care physicians have an important role in identifying eating disorders in this population, as they tend to present - particularly among individuals with type 1 diabetes - as repeated medical emergencies . The main screening tools for assessment of eating disorders are shown in Table 4.8 . Other screening tools include the Rating of Anorexia and Bulimia Interview-Revised Version (RAB-R) and the Multiaxial Assessment of Eating Disorders Symptoms (MAEDS) . Active screening for eating disorders is a reasonable practice, as they are common in adolescents, particularly in high-risk groups such as athletes, performing artists, models and actors .","Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 provide specific criteria for the diagnosis of bulimia and anorexia. Structured interviews allow the reliable and valid assessment of the key behavioral features and associated psychopathology of eating disorders. Patients with eating disorders are likely to present with profound weight loss or weight fluctuations, malnutrition and a number of medical complications associated with recurrent vomiting, as well as social problems. Comorbid psychological problems include depression, anxiety and obsessive behavior, and substance misuse in patients with bulimia. Laboratory tests may help to identify the degree of electrolyte imbalance caused by frequent purging and to determine overall nutritional status and need for hospitalization."
9781908541901,ch_6,"Since platelet function and coagulation play pivotal roles in the generation of a clot at the site of plaque rupture (see Chapter 1) and in subsequent ischemic events, a combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents (together known as antithrombotic therapy) is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with ACS (Figure 4.3) . However, with improved invasive technologies and concomitant treatments that address modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, ischemic event rates are falling in clinical trials and therefore the efficacy of treatment strategies that uniformly employ more potent platelet inhibition may also decrease in the future . In the CURRENT-OASIS-7 trial, which studied both the high and standard doses of clopidogrel and ASA in a 2 x 2 factorial design in patients with STEMI or NSTE-ACS, there were no significant differences in the 30-day outcomes of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, and no differences in major bleeding between ASA, 75-100 mg/day and 300-325 mg/day . A higher clopidogrel dose has been shown to reduce the prevalence of high platelet reactivity: a strategy of higher clopidogrel loading and maintenance doses in the CURRENT-OASIS-7 trial was associated with reduced stent thrombosis and combined clinical endpoint rates but an increased risk of major bleeding in high-risk patients . In the TRITON-TIMI-38 trial, prasugrel plus ASA was associated with a 19% reduction in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke at a median 14.5-month follow-up compared with clopidogrel plus ASA in patients with NSTE-ACS and STEMI undergoing planned PCI . In the TRILOGY trial, in patients with UA/NSTEMI who did not undergo revascularization, prolonged treatment with prasugrel was not associated with a reduced rate of major cardiovascular events compared with clopidogrel . These older studies supported the upstream use of a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor in combination with ASA and an anticoagulant in high-risk patients with ACS . The ACUITY trial examined the optimal strategy for the use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors in moderate- and high-risk NSTE-ACS patients undergoing early invasive therapy . Bivalirudin alone, compared with heparin and a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor, demonstrated non-inferiority in terms of the rate of the composite ischemia endpoint, significantly reduced rates of major bleeding and was associated with greater net clinical benefit . In the EARLY ACS trial, high-risk NSTE-ACS patients were randomized to receive either early routine administration of eptifibatide (double bolus followed by standard infusion) or delayed provisional eptifibatide at the time of PCI in addition to ASA and clopidogrel . The lack of significant efficacy and increased bleeding in the trial have affected recent guidelines for routine early GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor administration in NSTE-ACS patients . The increasing use of the new antiplatelet agents prasugrel or ticagrelor in NSTE-ACS may further reduce the need for GPIIb/IIIa receptor blockers but this has not yet been addressed in specific randomized controlled trials . In the APPRAISE-2 trial, the addition of apixaban, 5 mg twice daily, to standard DAPT (ASA and clopidogrel) in high-risk ACS patients was associated with increased major bleeding events but no significant reduction in recurrent ischemic events .","Although the in-hospital mortality is higher in patients with STEMI than those with UA/NSTEMI, the 6-month mortality rates are similar and the 4-year mortality rates are two times higher in patients with UA/NSTEMI. Early invasive strategy followed promptly by revascularization is increasingly preferred over conservative strategy. Antithrombotic therapy is a fundamental strategy in patients with UA/NSTEMI; however, proper risk assessment is essential to determine an optimal strategy that achieves a maximum anti-ischemic effect associated with an acceptable bleeding risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) and a P2Y receptor blocker is the standard of care in patients with UA/NSTEMI; however, optimal duration of therapy is controversial. Guidelines uniformly recommend starting all UA/NSTEMI patients (without contraindications) on an anticoagulant as soon as possible after presentation. The benefits of triple therapy of ASA, P2Y receptor blocker and warfarin/oral anticoagulant have not been clearly established. The role of direct oral anticoagulants for long-term therapy is being studied in large-scale trials. Since patients with UA/NSTEMI have a high risk of recurrent ischemic events, active long-term management strategies are crucial."
9781908541727,ch04,"The clinical assessment of a patient with double vision (diplopia) is complex, and it is very difficult for non-ophthalmologists to accurately differentiate between serious and non-serious causes . For this reason, all patients with new-onset transient or persisting double vision require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist, ideally to be seen the same day . Many adults with double vision have an ischemic third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy, which will usually resolve spontaneously within a few months . New-onset double vision is also a common presenting symptom of potentially fatal brain aneurysms, brain tumors, stroke, myasthenia gravis or temporal arteritis . Brain aneurysms in particular can rupture, causing a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and may kill the patient within hours of the onset of double vision if they are not immediately diagnosed and treated . As outlined in the following sections, double vision can result from disease of the orbit, extraocular muscles, neuromuscular junction, ocular motor nerves or brain . Thyroid eye disease causes swelling of the extraocular muscles and orbital connective tissue, pushing the eyeball forward (proptosis) and often causing restricted movement of the eye along with diplopia (Figure 4.1) . Neuromuscular junction disease (myasthenia gravis) is a relatively common cause of diplopia and/or ptosis (drooping upper eyelid/s) in adults of all ages . The most common cause of diplopia in patients over 50 is an ischemic third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy; this is usually due to diabetes or atherosclerosis . In either of these presentations, the pupil constrictor muscle, which is also innervated by the third nerve, may be affected (causing a dilated pupil that constricts poorly to light) or unaffected . Partial third nerve palsy may not be obvious, as it can present as a subtle vertical muscle imbalance (one eye higher than the other) or one eye turned out with horizontal, vertical or oblique double vision . When the lid is lifted, the eye is seen to be turned out (by the action of the intact sixth nerve on the lateral rectus) and cannot move in any direction except further out towards the ear . The palsy causes superior oblique weakness, resulting in the affected eye being higher than the unaffected eye . Fourth cranial nerve palsy may be congenital, and often presents as head tilt in children . Ischemia is also a common cause of fourth nerve palsy . The palsy causes lateral rectus weakness; the eye turns in and cannot turn out fully towards the ear (Figure 4.3), which results in horizontal double vision . Brain tumors may cause third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy (see above) . Disease of higher brain centers can also cause complicated eye movement disorders . Temporal arteritis is a sight- and life-threatening disease that only affects patients over 50 . Alternatively, they may present with a third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy . Causes of double vision after eye or head trauma include orbital fractures or bruising; third, fourth or sixth nerve palsy due to the initial head trauma or secondary to an expanding intracranial hemorrhage; or brain damage causing an eye movement disorder .","Urgently refer all patients (of any age) with new-onset double vision to an ophthalmologist, ideally to be seen the same day. Double vision may be due to disease of the orbit, extraocular muscles, neuromuscular junction, ocular motor nerves or brain. It is often very difficult to accurately diagnose the cause on examination. Brain aneurysms - which can be fatal if they are not urgently diagnosed and treated - are a not infrequent cause of double vision in adults; patients often present with partial or complete third nerve palsy. Pupil size is not a reliable indicator of whether an aneurysm is present. Overall, the most common cause of diplopia in adults is ischemic third, fourth or sixth cranial nerve palsy. Temporal arteritis should always be excluded."
9781910797082,ch09,"Psoriatic arthritis is a common autoimmune inflammatory condition affecting the joints and entheses (insertion sites of tendons and ligaments) of patients with psoriasis . It is especially challenging for the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis when joint manifestations appear before signs of skin disease . Explosive new onset or worsening of psoriasis and/or psoriatic arthritis may prompt testing for HIV infection, because a higher prevalence of these diseases has been reported in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome . Given the heterogeneous manifestations of psoriatic arthritis and the potential for incorrect diagnosis, it is not surprising that the literature offers a wide range of prevalence figures for this disease . The treatment of psoriatic arthritis has been revolutionized by the recent development and use of receptor-targeted therapies, especially anti-TNF medications, for patients with moderate-to-severe disease . Methotrexate is widely used for psoriatic arthritis despite the fact that the only controlled trial data have shown marginal results in both the joints and skin . Given the proclivity of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis to have metabolic syndrome (see page 28), including obesity and the potential for associated fatty liver changes, special care needs to be taken to monitor for hepatotoxicity . Other receptor-targeted therapies have been, are currently being or are soon to be tested in psoriasis, two of which have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis . Ustekinumab, an inhibitor of IL-12/23/p40, which targets both Th1 and Th17 cell pathways, has now been approved for both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, the latter based on two Phase 3 trials that showed efficacy in multiple clinical domains including joints, skin, enthesitis, dactylitis, function and quality of life . In several Phase 3 trials, the drug showed consistent efficacy in treating arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis and skin disease, and improved function and quality of life . Several inhibitors of IL-17 that have shown dramatic efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis are being evaluated for psoriatic arthritis . A Phase 2 trial with the IL-17 receptor inhibitor brodalumab demonstrated efficacy in key clinical domains in psoriatic arthritis and is now in Phase 3 development . IL-6 is a key pro-inflammatory cytokine in numerous chronic inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; an IL-6 receptor inhibitor, tocilizumab, is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis . Tofacitinib has demonstrated efficacy in Phase 3 trials in psoriasis and is being studied in psoriatic arthritis . The first psoriatic arthritis study to evaluate the value of 'treating to target' has demonstrated that intensifying treatment to achieve a state of 'minimal disease activity'(MDA) (Table 9.4), based on frequent quantitative patient assessment, can achieve better clinical outcomes, although with more side effects and greater use of biological and combination therapies . Many patients with psoriatic arthritis are managed primarily by a dermatologist - or in some situations by their primary care physician - for the skin manifestations of their disease . This progression may now be ameliorated or prevented with the use of older disease-modifying agents, but especially with the receptor-targeted therapies .","Psoriatic arthritis is often underdiagnosed and undertreated; however, it is important to recognize this disease because advances in therapy offer the prospect of more complete disease control. The classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis are highly specific and sensitive. Traditional oral therapies may be effective for some clinical domains of psoriatic arthritis. All available anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and demonstrate significant ability to control signs and symptoms, improve function and quality of life, and inhibit progression of structural damage of joints. New therapies with a different mechanism of action from TNF inhibition, ustekinumab and apremilast, have been approved for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis; other promising therapies are in development. Optimal management requires a team approach between dermatologist, rheumatologist and primary care provider."
9781910797150,ch07,"Despite clear international guidelines on the optimal use of antiemetic regimens for the prevention and control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), these symptoms are still estimated to affect 35-50% of patients who undergo chemotherapy even with the use of effective antiemetic agents . Several issues continue to limit the effectiveness of CINV prevention and management . underestimation of the incidence of CINV by healthcare professionals and/or the effect it has on patients' quality of life . concerns about the adverse effects and/or costs of antiemetic treatments . poor adherence to prescribed antiemetic medications . A recent multinational European survey, aimed at verifying the incidence of CINV and the corresponding antiemetic treatment patterns, showed there is a perceptual gap between patients and physicians/oncology nurses, particularly in terms of the occurrence of nausea and the impact CINV has on patients' quality of life . Although, in this survey, the physicians and oncology nurses overestimated the incidence of CINV, they underestimated its effect on patients' quality of life . In total, 76% of the physicians in the European survey described above prescribed guideline-directed CINV prophylaxis for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) . This decreased to 15% for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), while 86% prescribed no or minimal antiemetic medication for patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy . Adverse effects and costs were cited as key factors in their reluctance to prescribe prophylactic CINV medication . No patient monitoring in the 5-day period following chemotherapy was reported by 27% of physicians and 33% of oncology nurses, and was confirmed by half of the patients . The main reason for not reporting CINV in the European survey was a general perception by 51% of patients that nausea and vomiting is an inevitable consequence of chemotherapy that had to be tolerated . Only 38% of patients in the European survey reported full adherence to the guidelines given to them by their physicians/oncology nurses when self-administering antiemetic medication . Studies have shown that oncology nurses and nurse practitioners can have a key role in influencing the selection of the antiemetic regimen, and it is important that they are aware of the latest antiemetic guidelines and the factors that put patients at risk for CINV . Clinicians should reassure patients that the incidence or severity of CINV is not an indicator of the effectiveness of their chemotherapy and that nausea and vomiting should not be considered a normal part of treatment . Minimizing the pill burden and eliminating the requirement to swallow medication can also improve patient adherence to treatment . It is important to assess symptoms throughout therapy, as patient response to antiemetic treatment may change over time and may require adjustment of the antiemetic regimen . Telephone follow-up by oncology nurses with patients 24-48 hours after chemotherapy will provide important patient information as well as suggested treatment for unreported breakthrough CINV . Given the high incidence of nausea only experienced by patients, a better understanding of the pathophysiology of nausea and new approaches to its treatment are required .","Issues that may reduce the effectiveness of CINV control by healthcare professionals include underestimation of the incidence of CINV, concerns about the adverse effects and cost of antiemetic agents, and insufficient following up after chemotherapy. Patient factors that may reduce the effectiveness of CINV control include under-reporting of symptoms and poor adherence to medications. Incorporating antiemetic guidelines in electronic medical record prescribing orders may help to ensure prescription of optimal antiemetic regimens by healthcare professionals. Clinicians must emphasize the importance of continuing medications at home and completing the full course of treatment. Telephone follow-up by oncology nurses with patients 24-48 hours after chemotherapy will provide important patient information."
9781910797082,ch08,"non-specific reversible binding of the T cell to the APC through interactions of surface molecules on the two cells . recognition of the major histocompatibility complex molecule on the APC by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor . costimulatory signal from the APC to the T cell via surface molecules, leading to the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), which binds to the IL-2 receptor on the T-cell surface; several different molecular interactions may function as costimulatory signals . Once the T cells have been activated by the APC, they enter the bloodstream and migrate back to the skin . Initial skin activation is required for APCs to migrate from the skin and interact with T cells (proinflammatory state) . As specific details of the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis have been elucidated, new therapies have been developed that target the aberrant immune cells and molecules that trigger the development of psoriatic plaques . Receptor-targeted therapies have been in clinical studies and usage for a wide range of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders since 1997, but for psoriasis since 2003 . They are designed specifically to interfere with T-cell activation and effector function in order to prevent the inflammatory effects characteristic of this group of diseases . There are several important factors to consider before starting biological therapy (Table 8.1); for example, many of these drugs are also effective in treating psoriatic arthritis, a debilitating inflammatory arthritis that affects around 30% of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriatic skin disease (see Chapter 9) . Receptor-targeted therapies (or 'biologics') are proteins derived from recombinant DNA technology, hybridomas, blood and whole human cells . Alefacept, a fusion protein combining LFA3 with the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin (Ig) G, was discontinued in 2011 due to relatively poor responses (less than 25% of patients experienced a 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI 75] scores) despite sustained remissions for up to 1 year in a small percentage of patients . This agent eliminated pathogenic T cells by binding to CD2 on T cells to block costimulation by LFA3 on APCs (see Figure 8.1) . Although discontinued in 2009 after three reported cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), the anti-CD11a humanized monoclonal antibody efalizumab was shown to prevent the interaction of LFA1 with ICAM1 on APCs and block the costimulatory signal . The LFA1-ICAM1 interaction is also involved in T-cell migration into inflamed tissue, and was a second mechanism of action against psoriasis for this drug . Four agents are available to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis: three TNFalpha-blocking drugs (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) and one anti-IL-12/23 agent (ustekinumab) . Infliximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically binds soluble and surface-bound TNFalpha . Smaller ACR 20 responses in psoriatic arthritis have been noted with these three IL-17 agents compared with the currently approved TNFalpha drugs . Receptor-targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis since their introduction in 2003 . While the goal for patients is long-term disease-free remissions and improved quality of life, overall cost and long-term safety will be key issues in determining the significance of biological therapies in the treatment of psoriasis .","Receptor-targeted therapies ('biologics') target specific molecules involved in the immunopathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and ankylosing spondylitis. The biologics currently available or in clinical trials are all given by injection (subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous). Evidence to date suggests that biologics have fewer organ-specific toxic effects than traditional systemic agents. Reduction in the inflammatory systemic components of other organs (exempli gratia joints and heart) is a positive development. A number of exciting new agents are in various stages of development and clinical trials. Cost and long-term safety will be important in determining the future role of biologics in the treatment of psoriasis. Biosimilar agents, soon to be introduced, could help to reduce cost issues considerably."
9781908541406,ch_9,"Von Willebrand disease is a relatively common, usually mild, bleeding disorder caused by a reduced plasma concentration of either a structurally normal von Willebrand factor (VWF), or the presence of a structurally abnormal molecule with reduced activity . The higher-molecular-weight multimers are functionally more effective in promoting platelet adhesion and aggregation . VWF stabilizes FVIII in the circulation; in patients with von Willebrand disease, the half-life of FVIII is shortened and the plasma concentration of FVIII is decreased . As VWF is essential for primary hemostasis, individuals with von Willebrand disease experience bruising, epistaxis, prolonged oozing from superficial cuts, menorrhagia and immediate bleeding after parturition, trauma or surgery . Patients with type 3 disease (see below) have a recessive inheritance; the FVIII level is very low and bleeding simulates hemophilia, with hemarthroses and muscle hematoma, as well as mucosal hemorrhages . For a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease to be made, the plasma levels of normally functioning VWF must be reduced or a structurally abnormal molecule with altered function must be present . The primary hemostatic function of VWF is best assessed by its ability to support ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation in vitro, using the von Willebrand ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) assay . In some patients with normal or borderline VWF levels, a primary platelet disorder should be considered, as the clinical presentation of bleeding can be identical . Type 2M: the VWF has decreased ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation but the high-molecular-weight multimers are present in normal amounts . Type 2N (Normandy) is due to an abnormality at the FVIII binding site on the VWF protein . Although the majority of cases of von Willebrand disease are genetic and a bleeding tendency becomes apparent by adolescence, occasionally patients present with a recent history of abnormal bleeding due to decreased plasma VWF . Desmopressin therapy is appropriate for many patients with von Willebrand disease (Table 7.3) . For those with type 1 deficiency, the response to desmopressin is usually good, with a brisk rise in the level of normally functioning VWF and FVIII (see Figure 5.2) . In type 2A, although the VWF level may rise in response to desmopressin, the circulating VWF molecules are not functionally very effective and they may also be cleared rapidly . In type 2B, desmopressin releases more high-molecular-weight multimers from endothelial cells, inducing further platelet aggregation and worsening the thrombocytopenia . Although desmopressin will increase the concentration of VWF in type 2N disease, it is important to determine the duration of the beneficial effect, and particularly the duration of the elevation in FVIII . Treatment with a concentrate containing VWF is necessary for patients with major bleeding or about to undergo major surgery . During the manufacture of some plasma-derived FVIII concentrates the VWF copurifies with FVIII, and concentrates that contain both molecules are suitable for treating von Willebrand disease . All patients with von Willebrand disease should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B viruses . Before 1990, some patients with von Willebrand disease treated with multiple infusions of cryoprecipitate or VWF-containing FVIII concentrates became infected with hepatitis C virus or occasionally with HIV .","All patients with von Willebrand disease should be characterized by laboratory investigation as fully as possible. Desmopressin is safe and effective therapy for many patients. When a clotting factor concentrate is indicated, it should contain high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor."
9781912776238,ch6,"However, experience to date indicates that the adverse event profiles of biosimilars match those of their originators . Indeed, safety monitoring within the European Union (EU) since the introduction of biosimilars has not identified any relevant difference in the nature, severity or frequency of adverse effects between biosimilars and their reference medicines . The comparability studies performed on biosimilars mean that the risk of new or severe adverse events (type 2) is likely to be lower than with a novel biological agent . Immunogenicity is a potential safety concern with any biological agent, and even slight changes in structural properties or impurities could, in theory, trigger an adverse immune reaction . This is not only a direct safety issue, but underlies the anxieties over biosimilar brand switching, as differences in anti-drug antibody levels between two drug brands, or between different manufacturing process variants of the same brand, could create a loss of drug efficacy after switching . Product drift over time and evolution through manufacturing changes may produce structural differences in a reference biologic, meaning that no biologic can ever be considered truly identical to itself over time . Immunogenicity cannot yet be predicted from analytic or animal studies with sufficient accuracy for biological medicines . For this reason, clinical studies in humans remain a current requirement for biosimilar medicines (though not routinely required for a biological drug undergoing a manufacturing change or small molecule generics) . Biosimilars do not have to show that they have no immunogenicity - just that the levels are similar to those of the originator . Concerns about immunogenicity appear to be generally unfounded and, as discussed on page 75, European-approved biosimilars have not been associated with any increase in the incidence of such adverse events, similar to the US position . In contrast to the situation with biosimilars, documented immunogenicity differences with clinical impact have been reported for originator medicines undergoing manufacturing changes and with intended-copy biological drugs from less-regulated medical regions of the world . Clinical studies on a biosimilar prior to authorization are generally limited and, as for any new drug, postmarketing surveillance is required to enable identification of any rare adverse effects . Biosimilars are subject to the same degree of post-approval pharmacovigilance as the originator biologic . In 2010, Europe updated its pharmacovigilance guidance requiring member states to encourage the use of brand names in prescribing, health records and adverse event reporting . This is an issue that affects originator medicines as well - in the USA, for example, brand name reporting for different insulins was only 84% in the MedWatch system . Prior to full implementation, the European barcode standards could not automatically generate dynamic product information, such as batch numbers and expiry dates . Special reporting requirements may apply to biosimilars, even though they are versions of established originator brands, and they may likewise be assigned a black warning triangle requiring prescribers to report any adverse drug reactions . Observational real-world pharmacoepidemiology data may be available for the originator biologic; the European Medicines Agency (EMA) encourages biosimilar manufacturers to participate in these studies, if available, or to begin a new program .","The risk of new or severe adverse events is likely to be lower with a biosimilar than with a novel biological agent. Adoption of the naming conventions and accurate reporting is key to effective surveillance and the identification of any rare adverse events that emerge post launch. 2D DataMatrix barcodes, with batch numbers and expiry dates, can be used to track biologics at all points in the supply chain. Slight changes in a product can result in immunogenicity profile changes, but this applies to all biological medicines and not just biosimilars."
9781910797471,ch04,"Common and reversible causes of anemia such as hematinic deficiencies require exclusion, although the underlying etiology is often multifactorial, with the pentad of chronic renal failure, neurohormonal activation, a proinflammatory cytokine milieu, defective erythropoietin production and defective bone marrow function contributing in varying proportions . However, functional iron deficiency associated with elevated inflammatory markers (id est anemia of chronic disease) is characterized by adequate iron stores but reduced availability of tissue iron stores for erythropoiesis . Trials of ESAs have shown an increased risk of thrombosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (and increased all-cause mortality in trials of patients with malignancy) . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common comorbidity in patients with HF, with a prevalence of 10-46% . Low-grade systemic inflammation is common in patients with COPD and vascular disease, so their coexistence accelerates atherosclerosis and contributes to the increase in adverse cardiovascular events . Diagnosis of one disease in the presence of another is complicated by common symptoms and similar clinical signs, resulting in decreased sensitivity of diagnostic tests such as chest X-ray and ECG . In patients with dyspnea, normal serum levels of natriuretic peptides (BNP < 100 pg/mL) have high negative predictive value and help to rule out LV systolic dysfunction as a cause of symptoms . Moderate-to-severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] > 15) in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy has been shown to be independently associated with increased mortality (mainly due to sudden cardiac death) . Higher mortality (median survival reduced by 50%) has also been reported in patients with severe LV dysfunction (LVEF < 40%) and CSA . Patients with HF and sleep-disordered breathing treated with beta-blockers have a lower prevalence of CSA and a lower AHI, with the dose inversely related to the number of events . Evidence that CPAP has a positive effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with HF is lacking, despite observational studies reporting a decrease in sympathetic nervous activity, and blood pressure and improvement in cardiac performance (LVEF) . Renal dysfunction is frequently found in patients hospitalized with HF and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality . Moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction in patients with HF increases the relative mortality risk by 100% (absolute risk > 50% at 5 years) . The existence of both HF and renal dysfunction in an individual is called cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), which is divided into five types, according to the presentation (acute versus chronic) and primary cause of the syndrome (cardiac versus renal) . CRS type 3 (acute renocardiac syndrome) - AKI leading to acute cardiac dysfunction (HF, arrhythmia or coronary ischemia) . CRS type 4 (chronic renocardiac syndrome) - chronic kidney disease contributing to cardiac dysfunction . Transient abnormalities in liver function tests are relatively common in patients with chronic congestive HF . Acute ischemic hepatitis has been reported in patients with acute cardiac dysfunction (either new or decompensated chronic HF) . It is therefore not unexpected that depression in patients with HF is independently associated with poor prognosis, increased mortality and readmissions to hospital, and use of more medical resources .","Patients with heart failure (HF) should undergo regular monitoring for early diagnosis of anemia and appropriate investigation to determine the cause. Therapeutic intervention should be tailored to the individual, taking into account the velocity of hemoglobin fall, the presence or absence of concomitant renal dysfunction and the cause of the anemia. Despite inherent diagnostic limitations it is important for clinicians to establish the presence of pulmonary disease and to introduce early therapy for both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HF in order to limit their negative impact on morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing is important as treatment with continuous positive airway pressure in symptomatic patients is effective. HF therapy is challenging in the context of comorbid renal disease, as vasodilators may precipitate an increase in serum creatinine and potassium levels; however, current evidence supports the use of these drugs in patients with CRS type 1 providing the initial increase in serum creatinine and potassium are less than 30% and 5.6 mmol/L, respectively. Acute ischemic hepatitis may develop in HF with low-output state and is generally reversible. Clinical depression is not uncommon in patients with HF and is associated with a marked increase in HF morbidity and mortality. Initial screening for depression is therefore important."
9781910797457,chp6,"Recurrence after initial surgery or radiotherapy usually manifests as a rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) . A prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scan (see page 52) may reveal sites of cancer recurrence at very low PSA levels, typically in the prostate bed (after prostatectomy), within the prostate (after radiotherapy) or in more distant lymph nodes or bone sites . Cancer recurrence is confirmed if the PSA level is above the cut-off and rising with sequential measurements, but time to metastasis and death is variable and is often quite prolonged . doubling of the PSA level in less than 3 months is associated with shorter time to metastases and death . When only a raised PSA level is seen, it is not known whether the recurrence is local (in the prostate bed) or systemic (metastases) . A number of choices are available for the management of PSA recurrence, including watchful waiting, salvage radiotherapy and hormonal therapy . This treatment can be offered to men who have recurrence in the prostate bed or at distant metastatic sites confirmed by PSMA PET . Salvage radiotherapy is a potentially curative treatment for men with a high likelihood of residual cancer in the prostatic bed . The best results are in men who have a Gleason grade group of 3 or lower, pre-radiotherapy PSA below 1.0 ng/mL, positive surgical margins, and a PSA doubling time of more than 10 months . It is also more effective if PSMA PET confirms that the prostate bed is the only site of recurrence . The effectiveness of salvage radiation is improving, with 60-90% of men achieving undetectable PSA levels, especially if concomitant androgen ablation is used (see page 86-90) . Hormonal therapy is reserved for men who have progressive PSA rises and are unlikely to harbor isolated local recurrence, or have confirmed widespread metastatic disease . A recent randomized trial has shown that immediate hormonal therapy for PSA recurrence resulted in better overall survival (OS) than delayed treatment . PSA doubling time (see page 80) is usually the best predictor of metastatic disease; a PSA doubling time of less than 3 months is associated with a higher risk of death . Once PSA recurrence has been identified, further investigations depend on the individual's circumstances and expectations, and involve determining whether the cancer is in the prostate, systemic or both . A prostate re-biopsy can be performed if salvage treatment for local disease is being considered, although tissue sampling is often more difficult because of post-radiation fibrosis, and the result is often negative . Salvage prostatectomy is an option if the tumor is likely to be limited to the prostate; however, it is considerably more difficult than in men who have not received radiotherapy and has a significantly higher incidence of side effects, particularly stress incontinence . Hormonal therapy is usually reserved for men who do not have isolated localized disease . A clear prognostic gradient based on the number of sites of bony metastases was identified, and further bony metastatic progression in men with up to three bony metastases had a major impact on prostate cancer-specific mortality .","Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level should reliably fall to below 0.1 ng/mL following radical prostatectomy. Recurrence after prostatectomy is generally defined as PSA above 0.2 ng/mL and rising. Recurrence after radiation therapy is usually defined as PSA that is at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir. For the average patient, metastases do not develop until 8 years after a PSA rise is detected, with death some 5 years later, so watchful waiting is an appropriate option for some men with recurrence. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT can be used to evaluate men who have a PSA rise after local treatment. Following prostatectomy, patients who have a high likelihood of local disease can be offered salvage radiotherapy. Following radiotherapy, patients who have recurrence in the prostate only may be offered a salvage treatment such as radical prostatectomy, High-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) or cryotherapy, but all of these carry the risk of side effects. Progressive PSA rises following initial therapy suggest micrometastatic disease, which should be treated with hormone therapy; however, the timing of this treatment is controversial. More evidence is needed from clinical trials to inform us of the most effective treatment options in these situations."
9781910797631,chp4,"It appears that young adults are least likely to seek professional help for mental health problems; indeed, people with these early-onset mood and anxiety disorders often wait more than a decade before seeking treatment . Ethnicity and culture may influence depression help-seeking, problem disclosure and expectations in relation to primary care and specialist clinicians, with differences found in these variables by research studies carried out in different countries and populations . Further barriers to seeking professional help may involve more general negative beliefs and attitudes - including views that particular interventions or professionals are not useful, that it is better to deal with mood problems by yourself, or negative stereotypes of mental illness . In Europe, a similar picture emerges: a large-scale survey in six European countries conducted between 2001 and 2003 revealed that almost one-half of survey participants would be embarrassed if their friends knew about their use of mental health services, and almost one-third felt that professional care was no better or worse than no help for a serious emotional problem . However, this review provides evidence that attitudes to mental health care are changing: over the two decades from 1990, responses from studies in Germany, Australia and the USA showed a significant increase over time in treatment recommendations for both medication and psychological therapy, as well as for seeking help from general practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists . Presentation with physical symptoms has been shown to be associated with lower rates of depression recognition and treatment, because treating physicians may misattribute varied ill-defined somatic complaints accompanying depression to non-psychological causes . Clinician knowledge and awareness of relevant clinical guidelines is pertinent to correct detection and ongoing management: a UK-wide survey of primary care providers identified that 58% of respondents were aware of guidelines for the management of depression, and similar findings have been seen among physicians in New York, USA . Ethnicity may influence disorder recognition: a study in inner-London general practices found psychological problems among black Africans were less likely to be detected by primary care providers than those in white or black Caribbean patients . The evidence concerning the impact on patient outcomes of these continuing professional development approaches for depression identification and improved management is limited, and indicates that changes in the organization of care are required . However, published studies of the feedback of such standardized measures to primary care providers have given contradictory results, and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of the use of screening or case finding in general medical and primary care settings have failed to find evidence that routine feedback of instrument results increases the recognition rate for depression or is linked to clinical improvements . The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland has eschewed routine screening and advocated the use of validated measures and case-finding instruments to assist in the assessment of people with suspected depression . Case finding for depression makes better sense and is more likely to be associated with clinical benefits when these two difficulties are addressed, and it is directed at patient groups with increased risks of depression, such as people with long-term physical health problems .","Identifying depression is the necessary first stage to enable ongoing monitoring, risk assessment, support and clinical management; however, many people with depression are not identified in primary care or medical settings. A combination of patient, clinician and contextual factors operate to hinder depression identification, but these factors can all be modified to improve the process of condition recognition. Interventions to improve recognition that do not incorporate changes to the context and organization of care are likely to have only weak effects on depression outcomes. The best evidence indicates the effectiveness of a combined approach involving education for clinicians and patients, systematic use of case-finding tools, and organizational changes to improve depression management capacity and sustain practice changes."
9781912776139,ch6,"Here, the discussion is limited to potential diagnostic biomarkers: that is, those that reliably distinguish people with ALS from individuals with weakness caused by other disease processes (disease controls) . Leading candidates include biofluid markers, and novel electrodiagnostic and neuroimaging techniques . Prospective application of existing biomarker candidates within a specialized clinical setting is required to ensure that they add value to the diagnostic process . Both neurofilament light chain (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) are structural proteins released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and thence to the peripheral blood in a wide range of pathological states that involve axonal breakdown, including ALS . Multiple studies have demonstrated higher CSF NfL and pNfH levels in patients with ALS than in healthy controls and, increasingly, also disease controls . Blood levels of these proteins are significantly less sensitive than CSF measurements, although neither has yet been adequately validated as a diagnostic biomarker in patients suspected to have ALS . Separately, higher initial levels appear to be associated with faster progression and reduced survival in ALS, supporting a role as a prognostic biomarker . The stability of levels within an individual patient also boosts their potential as a pharmacodynamic biomarker, and many therapeutic trials are now including this measure . The extracellular domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is present in higher concentrations in the urine of patients with ALS than in healthy controls . Urinary concentrations of the p75NTR extracellular domain have also been shown to rise in genetically susceptible individuals as the disease becomes clinically apparent . The intuitive goal of a TDP-43-based diagnostic biomarker for ALS, detectable in either CSF or blood, is hampered by the intracellular location of the protein and the limited sensitivity and specificity of antibodies as the basis for assay development . The technique uses a pulsed magnetic field directed at a small cortical area to induce local neuronal depolarization and hence the production of an action potential . TMS has now been well validated in ALS and may prove to be an important diagnostic tool in clinical practice . None of these currently has diagnostic application over standard electromyography in ALS but they may prove useful in more objectively assessing disease progression and treatment response . The application of MRI to the understanding of brain structure and function through novel advanced sequences and analysis tools has evolved far beyond the standard visual clinical image, which typically appears entirely normal . To date, insights have been group based and tools have proved challenging to develop at the level of the individual patient . As such, researchers have yet to find a role for these imaging techniques as a diagnostic biomarker . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a development of structural T2-based MRI that uses quantitative measures of water diffusion to estimate white matter tract integrity . A combination of these structural gray and white matter measures with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI markers of brain activity holds promise for defining a more individualized 'signature' of ALS .","A diagnostic biomarker of most immediate value in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) would be one that can help the neurologist distinguish atypical (exempli gratia LMN-predominant) cases from other disease states for earlier therapeutic trial enrolment. Neurofilaments are a leading candidate, especially if the blood-based assays become sensitive enough to supersede the need for cerebrospinal fluid testing. Urinary p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) levels have also shown promise. Threshold-tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation is sensitive to the cortical hyperexcitability that characterizes the syndrome of ALS. Motor unit nerve estimation and electrical impedance myography are emerging developments beyond standard electromyography. Multimodal structural and functional brain imaging may provide more sensitive markers of broader motor system dysfunction in the longer term."
9781910797907,chp3,"The differential diagnosis includes a heterogeneous group of hemolytic disorders, both acquired and congenital (Figure 3.1) . Many confounding factors can also complicate the clinical picture (id est concomitant iron or vitamin deficits, dysmyelopoiesis, liver or renal disease, chronic inflammation), underlining the need for a comprehensive clinical and laboratory evaluation of a patient presenting with a hemolytic disorder . The patient's history and clinical examination are fundamental to assess whether the disease is more likely to be congenital or acquired, whether the hemolysis is chronic or acute, and whether there is evidence of extrahematologic signs . Since AIHA may occur at any age, it should be considered a possibility in the differential diagnosis of congenital forms of hemolytic anemia . However, alongside the patient's history and the serological and specific tests for the different diseases, it should be remembered that mechanical hemolysis is characterized by the presence of schistocytes (fragmented RBCs) on a blood smear examination, the early (and easy) detection of which may be crucial for prompt treatment and a consequent favorable prognosis . Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by chronic intravascular hemolysis, thrombosis, increased susceptibility to infections and bone marrow failure . Microangiopathic forms of hemolytic anemia are characterized by mechanical destruction of RBCs, and include disorders such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation . Examination of a blood smear is fundamental to guiding the differential diagnosis of congenital hemolytic anemias . This form involves a severe functional defect in spectrin (the major cytoskeletal protein of the RBC cell membrane); it is an autosomal recessive disorder, and manifests as a severe hemolytic anemia with thermal instability of RBCs . When RBC morphology is unremarkable, a congenital hemolytic anemia due to an erythrocyte enzyme defect is highly likely . A further enzyme defect worth mentioning is hereditary pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase deficiency, which is the most frequent enzymopathy of RBC nucleotide metabolism causing non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia . Reticulocytosis and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are characteristic of extravascular hemolysis, whereas increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), free serum hemoglobin, hemoglobinuria and hemosiderinuria are typical of intravascular hemolysis, in which much higher levels of RBC destruction are seen (see Figure 3.7) . Reticulocytes (an index of bone marrow hematopoietic activity aimed at compensating for anemia) are mildly elevated in chronic/congenital hemolytic conditions, but dramatically raised in acute hemolytic crisis, and persistently increased in PK deficiency after splenectomy . mildly elevated in acute hemolytic crises resulting from infections in association with congenital anemias, and in AIHA with complement activation . slightly increased in extravascular hemolysis (seen in warm AIHA and congenital hemolytic disorders) . Haptoglobin is the most sensitive marker of hemolysis for both extravascular and intravascular RBC destruction, and can be decreased even in the presence of normal hemoglobin levels . Ferritin is increased in chronic hemolytic conditions (membrane defects and enzymopathies, chronic cold agglutinin disease and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia) . It is typically associated with marked intravascular hemolysis (PNH, G6PD deficiency) but is also found in reactions to incompatible RBC transfusions, severe burns and infections .","The differential diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency includes a heterogeneous group of acquired and congenital hemolytic disorders. The direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemias. False-positive and false-negative results should be taken into account. Several infectious, microangiopathic, mechanical, toxic and pharmacological causes of acquired hemolytic anemias should also be considered. Patient history and blood smear examination are fundamental in the diagnosis of congenital membrane defects, including hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and stomatocytosis. Congenital dyserythropoietic anemias and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis are recessive anemias to be considered and diagnosed mainly by molecular analysis. A complex group of enzyme defects (mostly recessive) are diagnosed by testing the enzymatic activity in the peripheral blood and by confirming the causative mutation at a molecular level (homozygous or compound heterozygous)."
9781910797433,ch03,"As described in Chapter 1, genetic factors are an important determinant of ovarian cancer risk . Indeed, inherited genetic mutations are associated with about 15% of ovarian cancers, depending on the cancer subtype . Furthermore, some epithelial ovarian cancers result from somatic mutations, as well as mutations in other genes that are critical in DNA repair pathways . Importantly, the absence of a family history of ovarian cancer may not preclude a genetic predisposition: inherited mutations may be present in up to 25% of women with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), but up to half of these women may not have a family history of ovarian or breast cancer . For these reasons, genetic testing has a valuable role to play in identifying women at risk of ovarian cancer . It is important to differentiate between genetic counseling and genetic testing . Most experts stress that informed counseling should be given before genetic testing by a qualified healthcare professional, but not necessarily a genetic counselor . Currently, there is a shortage of counselors to provide timely consultations; hence, some propose direct genetic testing without counseling, with the reflex use of counselors for patients with positive or questionable findings . The development of multiplex gene panel testing to sequence multiple genes simultaneously may identify more individuals with cancer gene mutations than BRCA1 or BRCA2 testing alone . This development, alongside a marked decrease in the cost of genetic testing, means that routine genetic testing is now much more accessible than was previously the case . Guidelines for genetic testing . A number of organizations have published recommendations and guidelines for genetic counseling and testing (also see Further reading, page 31) . Most of these recommend that all women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should undergo genetic testing, irrespective of their family history or age at diagnosis . The majority of guidelines recommend that genetic testing should include both pre- and post-test counseling with a genetic counselor or other appropriate healthcare professional with expertise in cancer genetics . The benefits of genetic testing in patients with ovarian cancer include . enabling amendments to screening recommendations and patient counseling, including consideration of surgical or non-surgical risk reduction strategies . Cascade testing is the testing of close blood relatives of individuals known to be at high risk of genetic conditions . If a genetic mutation (exempli gratia a BRCA1 mutation) is identified through initial genetic testing of the patient, further testing for this mutation can then be offered to close blood relatives of the affected individual (Figure 3.1) . Despite the potential benefits of genetic testing in terms of identifying women at high risk of ovarian cancer, referral rates for genetic counseling services are low . In one study, only 14.5% of women with ovarian cancer who should have been referred according to the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines received a referral for genetic counseling, and of those only 59.5% opted for counseling (although it should be noted that about 95% of women who received counseling subsequently underwent genetic testing) . diagnosis of breast cancer .","Inherited genetic mutations are associated with about 15% of ovarian cancers, depending on the histological subtype. Most guidelines recommend that all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer should be referred for genetic counseling and testing, irrespective of their family history. Cascade screening of close blood relatives of individuals found to carry specific genetic mutations can markedly reduce testing costs, because it is only necessary to test for the specific mutation. Referral rates to genetic counseling services are low, despite numerous guideline recommendations, because there are still significant funding issues."
9781908541727,ch07,"Patients will sometimes have no problems with their vision, but will present with concerns about an eye abnormality that they, their family or their optician has seen . Many abnormalities of eye appearance are minor and of no consequence; however, some abnormalities herald serious disease and require urgent referral, ideally to be seen on the same day . Acute proptosis with pain and a red eye is caused by orbital cellulitis, autoimmune orbital inflammation and carotid-cavernous fistula . Subacute or gradually progressive unilateral or bilateral proptosis with red eye/s is most commonly caused by thyroid eye disease (associated with Graves' disease) . Gradually progressive proptosis of one eye without redness is caused by orbital tumors . Examination usually shows fever, red eye, mild to severe proptosis and often limited eye movements (Figure 7.2) (see pages 79 -) . Thyroid eye disease is the most common cause of proptosis in adults, and usually has a subacute or gradual onset . However, sight-threatening complications can sometimes occur: the corneas can become ulcerated in association with severe proptosis if the eyelids cannot be fully closed; and compressive optic neuropathy, in which the optic nerve is squeezed by the enlarged extraocular muscles, can result in permanent loss of vision . It is therefore essential to check the vision and look for a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) in patients with thyroid eye disease . Orbital tumors may present with a proptosed but otherwise normal-appearing eye or, less commonly, they may mimic orbital cellulitis (acute red eye with proptosis) . Sometimes you will discover an abnormal optic disc on ophthalmoscopy, despite the fact that the patient has not complained of eye problems . When the intracranial pressure is raised significantly (due to tumor, hemorrhage or hydrocephalus) both optic discs swell (papilledema) (Figure 7.3) . It is also possible for unilateral or bilateral disc swelling to occur with normal intracranial pressure, as a result of unilateral or bilateral optic nerve disease of any cause (exempli gratia inflammation, ischemia or infiltration with tumor) . Patients with disc pallor usually complain of blurred vision or field loss; however, occasionally it is detected incidentally . Ongoing compression of the optic nerves or chiasm by a tumor is a relatively common cause of optic disc pallor . This disease is usually asymptomatic until advanced, because it causes a slow decrease in peripheral vision long before the patient notices central blurring . It is very rare for partial third nerve palsy from a tumor or aneurysm to cause an enlarged pupil in isolation (without double vision, ptosis or a visible abnormality of eye movement) . Horner's syndrome occurs as a result of damage to the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye and eyelid; it may be caused by disease in the brainstem, cervical spinal cord, brachial plexus, lung apex, neck, base of skull or cavernous sinus . Dilating eye drops are a common cause of abnormal sized pupils . poor vision in both eyes from early childhood (due to retinal or optic nerve disease, or congenital cataracts) .","Urgently refer patients who present with any of the following signs:- acute red eye with proptosis (forward movement of one or both eyes) (possible orbital cellulitis)- bilateral optic disc swelling (possible papilledema from brain tumor or accelerated hypertension)- unequal pupils plus double vision (possible partial third nerve palsy from posterior communicating artery aneurysm)- an abnormal (dull or white) red reflex and/or white pupil in children (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract). It is very important to perform ophthalmoscopy, looking for optic disc swelling, on all patients who complain of headache; bilateral disc swelling may be the first and only sign of a brain tumor. - acute red eye with proptosis (forward movement of one or both eyes) (possible orbital cellulitis) - bilateral optic disc swelling (possible papilledema from brain tumor or accelerated hypertension) - unequal pupils plus double vision (possible partial third nerve palsy from posterior communicating artery aneurysm) - an abnormal (dull or white) red reflex and/or white pupil in children (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract)."
9781908541901,ch_8,"Despite reduced mortality during the acute phase of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) because of improved and timely reperfusion strategies, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), remain at heightened risk for long-term recurrent cardiovascular events . The goal of secondary prevention strategies is to reduce cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), the burden of angina and other ischemic events . Numerous hospital-based (cardiac rehabilitation) and cost-effective home-based secondary prevention programs have been shown to improve processes of care, coronary risk factor profiles and quality of life . However, internationally, patient access to these programs is low (around 30%), particularly in those groups with the greatest need for risk factor reduction, id est those with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, smoking or a family history of CAD . Nevertheless, patients with CAD do not achieve treatment targets regarding lifestyle changes, risk factor modification and therapeutic strategies, and there are huge gaps in applying current evidence to routine practice . For further information see Fast Facts: Smoking Cessation . The goal should be to achieve a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, or less than 130/80 mmHg if the patient is diabetic or has chronic kidney disease . In addition to lifestyle modifications (reduced salt intake, increased physical activity, weight control and alcohol moderation), pharmacotherapy (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) is recommended . BMI and/or waist circumference should be assessed at every visit, and the healthcare provider should consistently encourage weight maintenance or reduction through an appropriate balance of physical activity, caloric intake and formal behavioral programs . In general, the goal of lipid management is to achieve a target level of less than 100 mg/dL LDL cholesterol; for very high-risk patients (exempli gratia patients presenting with acute STEMI or CAD patients with diabetes) a further reduction of LDL cholesterol to less than 70 mg/dL should be considered . If triglyceride levels are 200 mg/dL or more, the goal for non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol-HDL cholesterol) should be less than 130 mg/dL; lower than 100 mg/dL for very high-risk patients is reasonable . In the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) daily doses of simvastatin, 20 mg, plus ezetimibe, 10 mg, safely reduced the incidence of major atherosclerotic events in a wide range of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease . Medically supervised rehabilitation programs are useful for high-risk patients . Physical activity improves four key mechanisms, which are considered to be important mediators of a reduced cardiac event rate . For further information see Fast Facts: Diabetes Mellitus . Moreover, post-MI depression is more likely to be associated with poorer adherence to medication and utilization of health services, increased morbidity and suicide risk, poorer risk factor profiles for congestive heart disease, and reduced quality of life and survival .

9781910797815,chp5,"Because of the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications and disease progression, the principal aims of treatment in PV are to reduce the risk of primary or recurrent thrombosis and to control symptoms, but without increasing the risk of hemorrhage or disease transformation . The rationale for reducing the hematocrit comes from clinical trials which showed that increased blood viscosity due to an elevated hematocrit is a major risk factor for thrombosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . All patients with PV should receive low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of thrombosis . Guidelines developed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) and the British Society of Hematology suggest that IFN-alpha should be considered for first-line therapy in patients under 60 years of age, whereas hydroxyurea is preferred in older patients . Both hydroxyurea and IFN-alpha are relatively ineffective in patients with severe symptoms, particularly pruritus, and treatment may need to be supplemented or replaced by other therapies such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (see below) . Second-line cytoreductive therapy may consist of hydroxyurea or IFN-alpha (depending on which was used as first-line treatment), the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, anagrelide, or busulfan in older patients (> 75 years) . In a study of 261 patients with PV who received hydroxyurea for a median of 4.4 years, resistance was associated with decreased survival (HR 5.6 [95% CI 2.7-11.9]; p < 0.001) and an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis (HR 6.8 [95% CI 3.0-15.4]; p < 0.001) . Patients with hydroxyurea-resistant PV may require repeated phlebotomy to maintain the hematocrit below 45% (Figure 5.5) . In the RESPONSE trial, 222 phlebotomy-dependent patients with splenomegaly and either resistance to or intolerance of hydroxyurea were randomized to receive ruxolitinib or placebo for 32 weeks . The primary endpoint (a composite of hematocrit control [ineligibility for phlebotomy] and >= 35% reduction in spleen volume) was achieved in significantly more patients receiving ruxolitinib (Figure 5.6), and a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved a complete response (ELN criteria): 23.6%, versus 8.9% with placebo (p = 0.003) . At 28 weeks, hematocrit control was achieved in 62% of ruxolitinib-treated patients, compared with 19% of patients receiving best available treatment (p < 0.0001) . A further study (MAJIC) is currently investigating the efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with high-risk PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea . Risk factors for leukemic transformation include advanced age, elevated leukocyte count and abnormal karyotype; a JAK2 V617F allele burden greater than 50% is associated with an increased risk of fibrotic transformation (Table 5.3) . It seems intuitive that patients with such risk factors should be treated as high risk, although it is currently unclear whether cytoreductive therapy reduces the risk . The aims of treatment should therefore be to control symptoms, prevent thrombosis and hemorrhage, to minimize the risk of transformation, and to control the hematocrit in all patients with a leukocyte count below 10 x 10 /L and in high-risk patients a platelet count below 400 x 10 /L . frequent or increased need for phlebotomy to control the hematocrit (> 4 per year) .","The aims of treatment in polycythemia vera (PV) are to reduce the risk of primary or recurrent thrombosis and to control symptoms, but without increasing the risk of hemorrhage or disease transformation. Current treatment strategies focus on reducing the elevated hematocrit resulting from excessive red blood cell production, and aspiring to decrease the risk of thrombosis. Treatment is stratified according to the level of risk. All patients should receive low-dose aspirin and undergo regular phlebotomy to reduce the hematocrit. These measures may be sufficient in low-risk patients whereas those at higher risk may require cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha or other agents. A significant proportion of patients develop resistance to hydroxyurea, necessitating repeated phlebotomy at increasingly shorter intervals to control the hematocrit, indicative of inadequate disease control. The Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib may be useful in patients with hydroxyurea-refractory PV."
9781910797471,ch01,"The definition of ejection fraction (EF) (the percentage of blood pumped from the ventricles with each heart beat) is fundamental to defining diastolic and systolic HF (Figure 1.1) . Systolic heart failure or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction results from myocardial injury, which leads to impaired pumping function of the left ventricle (LV) and significantly reduced LVEF (< 40%) . It is the typical manifestation of patients with hypertensive heart disease and small ventricles with reduced stroke volume and filling disturbances . HFpEF is common in the elderly (affecting more women than men) in whom combined ischemia, hypertrophy and age-related fibrosis may act together to produce increased myocardial stiffness and delayed relaxation . Heart failure with normal systolic and diastolic function describes a group of patients with symptomatic HF but no evidence of systolic or diastolic dysfunction on resting echocardiography . Historically, these patients would have been diagnosed with HFpEF, but dobutamine stress echocardiography has helped to reclassify about 60% of these patients with various diagnoses, including left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, development of restrictive filling pattern at stress, chronotropic incompetence or underlying ischemic heart disease . Acute versus chronic heart failure . Acute LV failure elevates LV diastolic pressure, which causes a significant rise in pulmonary venous pressure, resulting in pulmonary congestion (edema) as well as subendocardial ischemia, further LV remodeling and worsening of mitral valve regurgitation . The combination of poor cardiac output (in 50% of patients with acute HF) and renal venous hypertension may precipitate a worsening of renal function and could cause cardiorenal syndrome (see Chapter 4) . Although advances in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes have reduced deaths from coronary artery disease (CAD), in the USA in 2014 non-cardiovascular disease was the underlying cause of death for more than one-third of HF-related deaths of adults aged 45 or over . The rising prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus with associated cardiovascular complications is likely to result in further increases . Some of the factors listed above cannot be modified (exempli gratia aging of the population), but prevention of those that precede the development of HF (CAD, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, obesity) should be a priority . However, about 50% of these readmissions are due to non-HF conditions (exempli gratia respiratory causes) and this rate is even higher in those over 65 years of age . CAD, arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease and diabetes mellitus are the four most important predisposing conditions for the development of HF (see Chapter 3) . Over the past 50 years, the prevalence of CAD and diabetes mellitus has increased, while rates of valvular heart disease and hypertension have fallen . Nevertheless, aortic valve disease and arterial hypertension remain the commonest causes of HFpEF in elderly people . The presence of two or more predisposing conditions in the same individual increases the risk of developing HF . For example, in patients with hypertension an antecedent MI increases the risk by five to six times, while symptomatic CAD, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy and valve diseases each increase the risk by two to three times .","Heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is characterized by an ejection fraction (EF) of less than 40%. The European Society of Cardiology has defined a new category of heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), characterized by an EF of 40-49%. Left ventricular HF is the most common type of HF. Symptomatic HF affects 2-3% of the global population. The financial burden associated with HF is likely to rise over the next 20 years. Coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, valvular heart disease and diabetes mellitus are the four most important predisposing conditions for the development of HF."
9781910797273,chp5,"Patients with active relapsing disease (usually defined as two relapses in a 2-year period) should be offered treatment, and an increasing body of evidence suggests that early therapy has advantages over delayed treatment (Figure 5.1) . Patients with the first clinical relapse and abnormal imaging that is consistent with MS, as per the updated McDonald criteria (see Table 3.5), should commence MS medication rather than waiting and potentially increasing the risk of long-term disability . Early initiation of DMTs in this cohort can delay a second relapse by up to 12 months and reduce disability progression by more than 2-3 years . In Phase III clinical trials, teriflunomide, 14 mg daily, reduced the annualized MS relapse rate by 31.5-36.3% versus placebo, and reduced the risk of sustained (more than 12 weeks) disability progression by approximately 25-30% . Dimethyl fumarate, 240 mg twice daily, is an effective oral therapy that has shown promise as both a first-line treatment and escalation treatment for MS . None of the patients had been exposed to any other drugs such as natalizumab, which is known to be a risk factor for PML, but occurred after prolonged treatment with dimethyl fumarate in patients who developed very low lymphocyte counts . Although the long-term safety of fingolimod needs to be further established, the convenience of oral therapy and excellent patient tolerability should be included in the risk-benefit equation discussed with patients when deciding on an appropriate DMT . Natalizumab has been shown to reduce the annualized relapse rate by 68% and the risk of disability progression sustained for 24 weeks versus placebo by 54% . In patients who cease natalizumab on the basis of increased risk of PML (see Figure 5.8 and 5.9), the therapeutic options are limited, as de-escalating therapy may result in a return of MS disease activity, with rebound relapses reported in approximately 20% of cases . Alemtuzumab is licensed for use in active relapsing remitting MS, but it is the authors' preference to consider its use for patients with highly active disease, or for those with disease activity despite treatment with other DMTs . However, the efficacy of this treatment in patients with long-standing secondary progressive MS without superimposed relapses is questionable, and bone marrow toxicity, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity and an established 0.1-0.2% lifetime risk of acute myeloid leukemia significantly limits its clinical utility . While newer therapies such as fingolimod, natalizumab and alemtuzumab offer significant efficacy advantages over injectable or other oral DMTs, their benefit must be weighed against a modest risk of complication . For patients with mild to moderate disease, a treatment escalation strategy has been advocated, starting with first-line injectable or oral DMTs . In mild MS, most neurologists commence therapy with an injectable DMT such as IFNbeta or glatiramer acetate, or oral therapy such as teriflunomide or dimethyl fumarate, and escalate therapy to more efficacious treatment in patients who continue to exhibit significant clinical or MRI disease activity . In particular, alemtuzumab should be considered in patients with highly active disease who have a higher risk of PML with natalizumab (exempli gratia those with positive JC virus antibodies; see Figures 5.8 and 5.9) .","Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) ameliorate CNS inflammation in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), effectively reducing the relapse rate and the accumulation of new brain lesions identified on MRI. Early introduction of DMT, even at the clinically isolated syndrome stage, may be advantageous. Conversely, immune-directed DMT is not effective in patients with established secondary progressive MS. DMTs can be given in injectable, oral or intravenous form. Newer DMTs, such as natalizumab, alemtuzumab and fingolimod, are significantly more effective than injectable agents, but carry modest risks that must be considered when making treatment choices in individual patients. A treatment escalation strategy is appropriate for most patients with mild to moderate disease. Clinical and radiological parameters should be carefully monitored for evidence of disease activity in this paradigm. Induction therapy for MS is a new concept, using one of the 'stronger' MS medications, to 'reset' the disease course. Early institution of efficacious newer-generation therapies should be strongly considered in patients with rapidly evolving MS. Cytotoxic immunosuppression and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are reserved for patients with MS that is refractory to available DMT."
9781910797297,chp1,"Over the past few years much work has been done in the field of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in terms of the clinical, pathological, biological and etiologic understanding of this diverse group of diseases . The term cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) encompasses a wide range of disorders . CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders, such as lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL), make up around 25% of all CTCLs . However, following research advances in biological and clinical behavior, the advisory committee recently released the initial 2016 Revision of the WHO Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms; the final version of this classification is expected later in 2016 . However, the cytomorphology of T cells often does not correlate with the clinical behavior of the lymphoma, except in rare instances . A number of these patients will progress to advanced/aggressive disease (around 25% of patients with MF) with a higher risk of secondary malignancies, particularly in those with LyP who may develop a systemic lymphoma . As such, all patients with indolent CTCL should be followed up closely for development of lymphadenopathy or systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss or night sweats suggestive of systemic lymphoma or another cancer type . CTCLs with intermediate/indeterminate clinical behavior include advanced stages of MF (stages IIB-IV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated T- and natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and a subset of other NK/T-cell disorders that are rare and less well understood at this time . Although it tends to have an indolent course, the disease does progress in some patients, who have an aggressive projection with fevers, hepatosplenomegaly and systemic involvement . Aggressive CTCLs often progress rapidly with extracutaneous involvement, have a poor prognosis and are associated with systemic symptoms . CTCLs are relatively rare diseases, with an annual age-adjusted incidence of 6.4 per million persons in the USA and similar worldwide . Several studies have shown geographic clustering of incidence within the USA, suggesting that environmental or other external etiologic factors have a role in the cause of the disease . In recent years, the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) databases in the USA have been used to analyze the age-adjusted incidence and survival rates in individuals with CTCL by sex and ethnicity . CTCL primarily presents in white individuals in the sixth decade of life, although the highest incidence in this population is seen in 70-79 year-olds . The overall incidence of both MF and non-MF CTCL is higher in men than women (Figure 1.2a), with a ratio of 2.2 to 1 . Furthermore, African-Americans and hispanics have a statistically significant greater incidence of presenting at a more advanced stage of both MF and non-MF . A possible causal role for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) provirus was indicated in 1980, when it was found in the peripheral blood of a black patient with cutaneous lymphoma . Epidemiological studies have found an increased incidence of secondary internal malignancies in patients with CTCL, particularly lung carcinoma, colonic adenocarcinoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which do not appear to be related to therapy .","Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) account for approximately 65% of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs); lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) make-up 25%, and the remaining 10% are rare diseases. Clinicopathological correlation is crucial in the diagnosis of CTCLs, as the histological findings do not always correspond with the clinical behavior, and many benign dermatoses can mimic the histopathology of MF and other CTCLs. CTCL is generally subdivided into neoplasms with indolent and those with aggressive clinical behavior. Indolent forms have a good prognosis and prolonged course, and often lack systemic symptoms. They are usually treated with skin-directed therapies. Aggressive forms have a poor prognosis, and are associated with systemic symptoms that warrant systemic treatment. They generally display a cytotoxic immunophenotype. CTCL is a relatively rare group of diseases with an estimated incidence of 6.4 per million persons. Onset most often occurs around the sixth decade of life in white people, with earlier onset in African-Americans. African-Americans have statistically significant higher incidence of both MF and non-MF CTCL, and often present with more advanced disease. Patients with CTCL have an increased risk of secondary malignancies. No familial link in CTCL has been identified."
9781908541468,ch_8,"Glomerulonephritis is often described as primary, when there is no associated disease elsewhere, or secondary, when glomerular involvement is part of a systemic disease . Primary glomerulonephritis may be described or classified according to the clinical syndrome produced (exempli gratia nephrotic syndrome), the histopathological appearance (exempli gratia membranous nephropathy) or the underlying etiology (relevant mainly in secondary causes) . In most glomerular diseases, the natural history and response to treatment have been defined with respect to the histopathological diagnosis (except for nephrotic syndrome in children), so a pathological description is preferred when considering management . More severe, acute forms of glomerulonephritis may present with 'acute nephritic syndrome', which involves hematuria (sometimes macroscopic), albuminuria, a fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), salt and water retention, and hypertension . Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis describes a rapid loss of kidney function, such that the patient will be in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within weeks or months . Chronic glomerulonephritis involves a much slower deterioration in kidney function, usually over several years, accompanied by hematuria, albuminuria and hypertension . Except in the mildest cases, or in nephrotic syndrome in children, the suspicion of glomerulonephritis should lead to kidney biopsy . Focal and segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis is generally secondary to systemic disease (see Chapter 7) . Crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figure 6.2) may occur as part of the evolution of certain forms of primary glomerulonephritis (exempli gratia IgA nephropathy or MCGN), but is more often seen in conditions such as Goodpasture's syndrome and systemic vasculitis . A condition previously described as idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis is now recognized as generally being due to renal limited vasculitis . Minimal change disease accounts for most cases of nephrotic syndrome in children, and about 20% of cases in adults . Although severe nephrotic syndrome has its own complications (exempli gratia thrombotic episodes, infection), minimal change disease does not progress to ESKD . Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in older children and younger adults; it may be associated with hematuria . About 50% of patients may respond to a course of high-dose prednisolone, although treatment for up to 4 months is often required in adults . Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in older adults . Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis is an uncommon disorder that can present as nephrotic syndrome or nephritic syndrome in children and young adults . It is also detected as asymptomatic hematuria and/or albuminuria, and can present with nephrotic syndrome . Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis generally presents with an acute nephritic syndrome 2 or more weeks after an infection . It presents with the clinical syndrome of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis . Without treatment, the disease progresses to ESKD within a few weeks or months, but prednisolone and cyclophosphamide are generally effective in patients before severe kidney damage occurs . The syndrome presents with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, usually leading to kidney failure within 6 months if untreated . Treatment with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, combined with plasma exchange to remove circulating anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies rapidly, is generally effective if started before renal disease is advanced .",Glomerulonephritis should be considered in all patients with urine abnormalities. Urgent investigations are needed to determine the precise type. Treatments are available for most categories of glomerulonephritis. Crescentic glomerulonephritis requires urgent and aggressive immunosuppression.
9781912776153,chp9,"If there is structural heart disease (exempli gratia mitral stenosis, impaired diastolic ventricular filling, systemic hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or restrictive cardiomyopathies), loss of atrial systole combined with a variable heart rate (particularly if rapid) can precipitate catastrophic hemodynamic changes such as pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure or, rarely, complete hemodynamic collapse . However, it is important to determine the type of AF (see Classification, page 90) because it determines overall management: a first episode requires assessment for future drug therapy and anticoagulation, but a single self-terminating episode may not require intervention; persistent AF requires rhythm control; and permanent AF requires rate control . This has now been refined to include scoring for specific age categories, the presence of vascular disease and female sex, all important risk factors as nearly half of AF-associated strokes occur in patients over 75 years of age, and AF is the most frequent cause of disabling stroke in elderly women . If the patient's symptoms are stable, then anticoagulation and rate control can be considered in the primary care setting, unless other clinical factors warrant referral (exempli gratia frail, non-compliant, concurrent dementia, other severe debilitating illness) . If patients remain symptomatic despite adequate rate control, or have AF recurrence, cardiological referral is recommended, as there are different treatment modalities depending upon whether the AF is paroxysmal, persistent or permanent (see page 91) . When the history suggests that AF may have been ongoing for longer than 48 hours, or if it is difficult to be certain, then oral anticoagulation and drug-based rate control should be initiated in uncompromised patients, with a view to an elective cardioversion in 4-6 weeks . Patients who have infrequent (once or twice per year) self-limiting episodes of paroxysmal AF and no structural heart disease do not usually require antiarrhythmic treatment (Figure 9.7) . Referral to a cardiologist is recommended for the assessment of long-term management, id est whether rhythm control with cardioversion or ablation is appropriate, or if rate control therapy should be continued, leaving the patient in long-standing persistent or permanent AF (see Figure 9.7) . If patients become asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic they can be maintained on rate control therapy for years, although they may need infrequent monitoring to ascertain whether any risk factors have developed that necessitate a change in the anticoagulation regimen . Although sinus rhythm is typically preferable, in some patients it is difficult to obtain/maintain and sometimes it may be appropriate to accept long-term AF and just control the ventricular rate . Patients with permanent AF in whom sinus rhythm cannot be obtained or maintained should be treated for ventricular rate control and anticoagulation . Furthermore, concerns about liver toxicity, and the risks associated with the administration of dronedarone in patients with renal and heart failure, have limited the clinical use of this drug . Beta-blockers can be effective in exercise-induced AF, but few patients have a single specific inciting cause for all episodes of AF, and the majority will not maintain sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic drug treatment .","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is very common and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is vital to determine whether AF is paroxysmal, persistent, long-standing persistent or permanent because the treatment aims are different for each patient group. Stroke risk and major bleeding risk in AF are multifactorial and can be assessed by the CHADS /CHA DS -VASc and HAS-BLED scores, respectively. The direct oral anticoagulants are gradually replacing warfarin as first-line anticoagulant treatment for AF. Radiofrequency ablation is now the preferred option for many patients with AF. AF ablation is still evolving as an interventional procedure, with the arrival of new mapping software and the continual evaluation of ablation methods and techniques. In most patients, AF is not cured by ablation. In many patients, AF is a progressive condition that may be associated with long-term recurrences of AF after apparently successful ablation procedures."
9781910797273,chp1,"The worldwide prevalence of MS appears to be increasing: this is related to many factors, including earlier diagnosis, an aging population and a true increase in disease incidence, especially in females . The estimated prevalence is 164 per 100 000 people in the UK, 95.6 per 100 000 in Australia and 135 per 100 000 in the USA . The incidence of MS, which peaks at age 30, appears to be rising in both the northern and southern hemispheres, particularly in women . The prevalence of MS is significantly associated with latitude, particularly in populations of European descent (Figure 1.1) . However, a statistically significant relationship between MS prevalence and latitude persists in some European populations even after adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequency, supporting a role for environmental factors that vary with latitude (exempli gratia ultraviolet [UV] light exposure, viral infections and vitamin D levels) . In Denmark, where an MS registry has been ongoing since 1948, there appears to be an increase in the incidence of MS in women, with a stable rate in the male population . An increasing incidence in females only has also been observed in Canada, Finland, Japan and southern hemisphere populations such as Australia . The latitudinal prevalence gradient for MS may be explained in part by a relationship to exposure to UV radiation from sunlight, as there is an association between low levels of UVB exposure and development of MS . This may explain the 'season of birth effect' whereby those born in spring (April) in countries in the Northern hemisphere have a significantly higher relative risk of developing MS than those born in winter months (October) . There is an association between low levels of vitamin D and a number of diseases, including MS . Populations exposed to limited sunlight but who consume diets rich in fatty fish, a good source of vitamin D, have lower MS prevalence rates than expected for their latitude . Higher vitamin D levels are associated with lower risk of relapse and slower rates of progression in MS . Individuals with MS are rarely seronegative for EBV, and there is a strong association between previous history of infectious mononucleosis and MS, with a twofold greater risk of MS in this group . An individual's age at the time of migration from a high prevalence area to one of low prevalence appears to affect the risk for MS, with a critical time period that may extend into early adulthood . Although these figures also implicate environmental factors in the genesis of MS, studies of 'non-biological siblings', that is, siblings who share the same environment but have different biological parents, do not suggest an increased risk related solely to environment . It is therefore likely that an individual's genetic background modulates susceptibility to environmental risk factors . Furthermore, epigenetic modulation of MHC by environmental factors such as vitamin D, smoking, EBV infection and early-life hygiene may modify the effect of allelic variation at this site . Most of the risk alleles associated with MS are related to function of the immune system .","At least 2.3 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is more common in women than men (2-3:1), and the incidence of MS in females is rising. The prevalence of MS is increasing worldwide, with a greater prevalence in populations of northern European descent. There is a 'latitudinal gradient' of MS, that is, a higher prevalence and incidence of MS in areas of higher latitude (remote from the equator). There is an association between low levels of vitamin D and prevalence (and possibly severity) of MS. Most people with MS have been exposed to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). People who have had infectious mononucleosis have a twofold higher risk of developing MS. The rate of MS is higher in smokers and in those with exposure to passive smoking than in those who have never smoked. MS has a heritable component, but the condition is not related to a single gene (multiple gene interactions are likely to be involved); the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele DRB1*1501 has a strong association with MS in Caucasians."
9781908541727,ch11,"Minor eye trauma is common and rarely serious - examples include corneal and subtarsal foreign body, corneal abrasion and periorbital bruising ('black eye') . However, all practitioners should also be able to recognize the warning symptoms and signs of serious eye trauma, including penetrating eye injury, intraocular foreign body and ruptured globe . The injury to the eye and orbital structures could be classified as struck by a blunt object, struck by a large sharp object, struck by high-velocity small fragments, or burns (chemical or thermal) . It is important to suspect a penetrating injury in any patient with a suggestive history such as hammering metal, which may, for example, cause a high velocity small fragment of metal to penetrate the eye . Even if the eye looks normal on examination, you must refer the patient urgently to an ophthalmologist because of the risk of intraocular infection or retinal toxicity to a metallic intraocular foreign body . Telephone an ophthalmologist immediately if you suspect your patient has a penetrating eye injury . Intraocular foreign body is most commonly caused by a small piece of high-speed metal striking the eye, often in metalworkers whilst hammering . You need to maintain a high index of suspicion even if the eye looks normal to you and even if you find a corneal foreign body, as a second piece of metal could be inside the eye . An urgent slit-lamp examination and X-ray of the orbit should be carried out in any patient who says they have been hit in the eye with a high-speed fragment . Hyphema may be seen after blunt trauma that has caused no other damage to the eye, or it may be a sign of penetrating eye injury, intraocular foreign body or ruptured globe . All patients with a possible chemical burn of the eye who have significant pain, photophobia or blurred vision require urgent ophthalmic referral for slit-lamp examination and treatment (even if their eyes look normal on examination) after the irrigation has been performed . If the foreign body cannot be completely removed, refer the patient to an ophthalmologist within 24 hours ('trying again' yourself the next day usually does not help) - you can apply antibiotic ointment and an eye pad in the meantime for comfort . If you have been able to fully remove the foreign body, apply antibiotic ointment and an eye pad and review the patient the next day . The small corneal abrasion caused by removal of a foreign body can be viewed with blue light and fluorescein drops, and should be seen to heal completely within 3 days . The patient may or may not remember anything going into the eye, and the foreign body will not be discovered unless the upper lid is everted (Figure 11.5) . The abrasion may be invisible unless a blue light and fluorescein is used (Figure 11.6); the eye should be otherwise normal and have no signs of corneal laceration or penetrating eye injury .","Refer urgently, to be seen by an ophthalmologist the same day, if your patient with eye trauma has:- been hit in the eye by a high-speed metal fragment; even if you find a corneal foreign body or find no abnormality on examination, the patient needs an X-ray to exclude the presence of an intraocular foreign body- unexplained eye pain, blurred vision, photophobia, flashes, floaters, field loss or double vision- an unexplained decrease in visual acuity (VA), field defect to confrontation, relative afferent pupillary defect, unexplained red eye, visible abnormality of the cornea, abnormal pupil shape or size, absent red reflex or swollen optic disc/s- blood in the anterior chamber (hyphema)- eyelids that are swollen shut, so that you cannot test VA (an ultrasound or computed tomography scan may be needed to confirm that the eyeball is intact)- chemical (do not delay immediate eye irrigation) or thermal burn to the eyes- a suspected infectious ulcer that has developed around a corneal foreign body- a non-infectious corneal abrasion that has not healed within 3 days. - been hit in the eye by a high-speed metal fragment; even if you find a corneal foreign body or find no abnormality on examination, the patient needs an X-ray to exclude the presence of an intraocular foreign body - unexplained eye pain, blurred vision, photophobia, flashes, floaters, field loss or double vision - an unexplained decrease in visual acuity (VA), field defect to confrontation, relative afferent pupillary defect, unexplained red eye, visible abnormality of the cornea, abnormal pupil shape or size, absent red reflex or swollen optic disc/s - blood in the anterior chamber (hyphema) - eyelids that are swollen shut, so that you cannot test VA (an ultrasound or computed tomography scan may be needed to confirm that the eyeball is intact) - chemical (do not delay immediate eye irrigation) or thermal burn to the eyes - a suspected infectious ulcer that has developed around a corneal foreign body - a non-infectious corneal abrasion that has not healed within 3 days."
9781912776207,ch1,"In the adaptive immune system, T and B cells recognize and respond to specific antigens, producing a tailored response to invading pathogens . Persistence of these 'experienced' T and B cells results in long-term immune memory . T cells develop from progenitors within the thymus gland . T-helper cells, which are primarily involved in coordinating the immune response to an invading organism . Early T cells express TCRs in germline configuration . Recombination of TCR genes during maturation of T cells produces a unique TCR configuration - a critical feature of protective immunity that enables mature T cells to recognize and respond to a broad range of foreign material . These alphabeta T cells recognize and bind foreign peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the cell surface of antigen-presenting cells . This MHC-antigen complex binds to alphabeta TCRs, while other co-stimulatory molecules (exempli gratia CD28) are activated, leading to alphabeta T-cell activation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and cytokine release . About 5% of T cells express a gamma and delta TCR (gammaδ T cells) . These cells have similarities with NK cells, with roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses . As a first line of defense after antigenic stimulus, gammaδ T cells release cytotoxic factors (perforins, granzyme B and TIA-1) . The gammaδ TCR is expressed by several extranodal subtypes of PTCL (see Chapter 2) . Lymphoid progenitor cells in the thymus undergo stepwise maturation (Figure 1.2) . Double-positive cells also encounter self-antigens and those that exhibit self-reactivity undergo negative selection . CD8 + T cells recognize antigens presented by the MHC class I molecules found on nucleated cells . Once activated, the CD8 + T cells proliferate to produce cytotoxic T lymphocytes - a population of effector T cells which release the enzymes and toxins that induce apoptosis . CD4 + T cells recognize antigens presented by MHC class II molecules, which are only present on specialized antigen-presenting cells . Most of these cells are 'helper' subsets, which release cytokines, sending positive signals to other immune cells, predominantly B cells (Figure 1.3) . A unique subset of CD4+ T cells, called T regulatory cells, restrain the immune response via various cytokine and signaling mechanisms, preventing aberrant or exaggerated immune activation . Follicular helper T cells provide essential support for B-cell immune responses . Our understanding of T-cell subsets has advanced significantly over recent years . The external signals (cytokines) that trigger polarized T-cell differentiation are being elucidated, as are the molecular mechanisms that alter T-cell behavior to produce specific effector functions .

NK cells are a type of lymphocyte derived from the same common lymphoid progenitor as B and T lymphocytes but develop primarily in the bone marrow .

They recognize and respond to specific antigens, producing a tailored response to invading pathogens. Mature T cells express a surface T-cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes fragments of antigen as peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Thymocytes do not express CD4 or CD8 initially (double-negative) but become double-positive during development, after which one molecule is downregulated.

9781912776238,ch10,"The direct anti-cancer therapies, rituximab, trastuzumab and bevacizumab, are monoclonal antibodies that bind to soluble or cell-surface proteins and block pathways or cells; they often have multiple modes of action and toxicity . The regulator's aim for a biosimilar is to show no clinically meaningful difference in efficacy, as determined by the totality of evidence from structural analytics, functional assays of biopotency and Phase I and III trials to show comparable safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints . The US National Cancer Institute Physician Data Query summaries conclude that, to date, there is no clear evidence from randomized trials that any course of treatment is superior to another, whether watchful waiting or active treatment such as cytotoxic chemotherapy, nucleoside analogs such as fludarabine, rituximab or radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies - either alone or in combination . With multiple modes of action and of toxicity, assays of potency and predictors of toxicity need to be correlated with confirmatory clinical trials before trastuzumab biosimilars can be approved . In both cases, the biosimilar developers demonstrated a change in the analytic potency characteristics of the reference trastuzumab linked with a manufacturing change that altered the drug fucosylation levels; claiming this as a likely explanation for its inferior clinical performance in the trial . The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) was split; while a significant majority favored approval as a biosimilar based on the explanation of the low-ADCC reference drug for superior outcomes data, a minority did not want to rely on the subgroup non-randomized post-hoc re-analysis of trials that removed the data from low-ADCC-treated control arm patients . This issue might be tested best in trastuzumab, where European regulators have so clearly used analytic data to overcome a non-equivalent confirmatory trial outcome . This does not strictly imply that the clinical study has to be equivalent, in the same way that European regulators used the demonstrations of safety, purity and potency for trastuzumab reference product to explain the residual uncertainty left after the completion of the Phase III trial . There is a further issue over the choice of which settings to use for clinical confirmatory trials; for breast cancer, regulators accepted trials in both neoadjuvant treatment using pathology testing as an endpoint and metastatic disease using response rates on chemotherapy . In comparison with rituximab and trastuzumab, bevacizumab has no similar significant impact on long-term cancer outcomes to secure WHO essential medicine listing as a cancer drug; instead, it is on the 'WHO Complementary List' in section 21.6 for the off-label indication of treating sight loss from wet age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) as an intraocular VEGF inhibitor . This off-label use is not without evidence: it is supported by clinical outcome data from the 2-year Comparison of wet-AMD Treatments Trials (CATT) in the USA (results published in 2012), the Inhibition of VEGF in Age-related Choroidal Neovascularisation (IVAN) trial in the UK (2013) and a Cochrane review, which concluded that bevacizumab and ranibizumab were equally effective . Designing confirmatory trials is also a problem, as the most useful indication is one with the greatest difference in pharmacodynamic endpoints for the reference drug .","Biologics used in oncology settings have, as their trial endpoints, survival rates at 5 years. Confirmatory clinical trials for biosimilars tend to use disease response as an endpoint. This can be potentially problematic when the association between response and survival is weak, as with, for example, bevacizumab in bowel and gynecologic cancers. Formulary decisions for long-duration drug tenders need to be forward thinking; if shorter-schedule treatments are adopted, might this impact on the relative merits of the biosimilar formulations approved? Lack of a uniform approach to the design of clinical confirmatory trials, including differences in statistical design, disease and disease stage and participant characteristics, make it very difficult for clinicians to compare biosimilars. Extension of patent protection, as occurs when a new indication is gained, can impede biosimilar developers from gaining an 'interchangeable' designation."
9781910797556,chp3,"As with any disorder of neuromuscular transmission, the distinctive clinical feature of MG is the fluctuating nature of weakness that patients report - a phenomenon known as 'fatigability' . Symptoms of MG tend to worsen with concurrent illness, over-exertion of the muscle (exempli gratia fatigue from speaking or eating), the use of certain medications, and as the day progresses . Approximately two-thirds of patients initially present with ocular symptoms . Testing of neck and limb muscles should likewise be done after a period of exercise to evaluate for evidence of fatigability . However, one or more tests are routinely performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis . Testing for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies is always performed in patients suspected of having MG . If these antibodies are present, no further diagnostic testing is usually required other than to evaluate for the presence of a thymoma with either CT or MRI of the thorax . AChR-antibody-negative patients with predominant bulbar involvement are often tested for muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies . Testing for antibodies to the P/Q type voltage-gated calcium channel is also often performed in cases of AChR antibody negativity to rule out Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome . In cases of antibody negativity, a decrementing response on slow (3 Hz) repetitive nerve stimulation (Figure 3.1) or elevated jitter values on single fiber electromyography (Figure 3.2) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of MG . It is worth noting that, while increased jitter on single fiber electromyography is very sensitive in patients with MG, it is not specific for the disease, therefore other causes of weakness should be ruled out . In addition, a decremental response on repetitive nerve stimuation may disappear in patients with MG in a muscle that is no longer clinically weak . Patients with MG should show an improvement in muscular strength following administration of edrophonium, a very short-acting anticholinesterase, which therefore increases the effective amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) . The treatment of MG should be individualized according to the patient's disease severity and its effect on daily living and quality of life, comorbid medical conditions and personal preferences . Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been used in the treatment of MG since 1934 when Walker successfully treated a patient with physostigmine for generalized disease . Unfortunately, most patients with MG cannot be controlled on anticholinesterase medications alone and require treatment with either thymectomy or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy (Figure 3.3) . Some clinicians will discontinue acetylcholinesterase inhibitors before starting a steroid taper to ensure patients are not dependent on these agents for symptomatic control . Although corticosteroids are effective, the myriad potential side effects of chronic corticosteroid treatment necessitates the use of other immunosuppressant agents in many patients with MG . A trial of one of these drugs is recommended in patients who are unable to tolerate the dose of corticosteroid required to control their symptoms or who relapse during a steroid taper . Intravenous immunoglobulin (Ig) and plasmapheresis are often used in patients with MG to reduce perioperative morbidity before surgery, inducing rapid improvement in patients with severe disease or in crisis .","Myasthenia gravis (MG) is characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. It can affect the ocular, bulbar, facial, neck, respiratory and limb muscles. The symptoms of MG may be exacerbated by concurrent illness, over-exertion of the muscle, the use of certain medications, and as the day progresses. All patients suspected of having MG should be tested for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies. If these antibodies are present, no further diagnostic testing is usually required other than the use of imaging to determine if a thymoma is present. AChR-antibody-negative patients with predominant bulbar involvement are often tested for muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibodies and, where available, antibodies to clustered AChR. (It should be noted, however, that clustered AChR antibody testing is available only at a few specialist centers, and is not routinely performed in general laboratories.) Patients who are antibody negative should be tested for a decrementing response on repetitive nerve stimulation, elevated jitter values on single fiber electromyography or a positive edrophonium test. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are often the initial therapeutic intervention in patients with MG. Most patients with MG require additional treatment with either thymectomy or immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy. Consideration of additional therapeutic options is warranted for patients who are identified as being refractory to conventional treatment."
9781910797815,chp1,"All myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are believed to originate from a single hematopoietic stem cell bearing one or more genetic mutations that subsequently undergoes clonal expansion; this is accompanied by hyperplasia of single or multiple hematopoietic cell lineages . The genetic basis of these MPNs has been elucidated over the last two decades but emerging evidence suggests that non-genetic factors such as age and inflammation also play important roles in their development and progression . The MPNs are caused by driver mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) or calreticulin (CALR) genes (Table 1.1) . JAK2 and CALR mutations are most commonly involved, although the distribution of driver mutations differs in ET, PV and PMF (Figure 1.1) . In general, these mutations are mutually exclusive (exempli gratia the presence of a JAK2 mutation largely precludes MPL or CALR mutations) and predominantly present only in MPNs (described as MPN restricted) . JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase that activates downstream signaling via erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptors and thrombopoietin receptors (the three principal myeloid cytokine receptors) (Figure 1.2) . The most common JAK2 mutation, V617F, results in substitution of phenylalanine for valine at position 617, which appears to render hematopoietic cells more sensitive to growth factors such as erythropoietin and thrombopoietin . The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in approximately 70% of MPNs, but 95% of cases of PV . The most common MPL mutations implicated in MPNs - designated W515L, W515K and W515R - are missense mutations affecting a tryptophan residue at the boundary between the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of the receptor . Frameshift mutations in the CALR gene are present in 50-60% of individuals with ET and 75% of those with PMF who do not have JAK2 or MPL mutations . More than 50 different mutations in the CALR gene have been reported, all located in exon 9, where they cause +1 frameshifts, resulting in MPL activation . It is a heterogeneous condition: some cases may be hereditary thrombocytosis, some have rarer mutations in JAK2, MPL or non-driver genes and some patients have no detectable mutations . Non-driver mutations have also been implicated in the initiation and progression of MPNs . Inflammatory cytokines are secreted by hematopoietic cells (with and without mutations) and by non-hematopoietic cells such as mesenchymal stem cells, and appear to create a favorable environment for the expression of JAK2 V617F . Environmental factors, notably age and genetic predisposition, appear to influence the initiation of MPNs . The prevalence of the JAK2 V617F mutation increases with age, underlying the increasing prevalence of both CHIP and overt MPNs . Such findings suggest that the presence of JAK2 V617F is sufficient to initiate the development of MPNs, although its low penetrance suggests that other factors must also be present (penetrance is the proportion of individuals carrying a particular gene variant who express a specific associated trait) . In particular, increasing age is associated with deregulation of hematopoietic stem cells, which may provide an environment that favors JAK2 V617F expression .","Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are usually caused by driver mutations in the JAK2, MPL and CALR genes. The most common JAK2 mutation is V617F, which activates downstream signaling via erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and thrombopoietin receptors. This mutation is associated with all three MPNs, whereas MPL and CALR mutations activate mainly the thrombopoietin receptor and hence are only associated with ET and PMF. Numerous other somatic mutations have also been implicated in the initiation and progression of MPN, including mutations that affect intracellular signaling pathways, epigenetic regulators, transcription factors and RNA splicing. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) refers to the acquisition of somatic mutations that drive clonal expansion in the absence of cytopenia and dysplastic hematopoiesis. Rarely, CHIP can progress to acute myeloid leukemia, either directly or via myeloid neoplasia or myelodysplastic syndrome; it can therefore be considered a precursor of hematopoietic neoplasms. Inflammation appears to play a key role in the development of PMF and other MPNs. Other factors, particularly older age and genetic predisposition, may also influence the initiation and development of these conditions."
9781910797433,ch10,"As in all cancer care, the follow-up of patients with ovarian cancer mostly lacks any prospective randomized evidence basis: guidelines are largely based on tradition, the wishes and experiences of patients and physicians, and rather arbitrary timelines depending on the type of examinations performed . Nevertheless, to date, no prospective evidence has shown that such follow-up results in a significant survival benefit in patients with ovarian cancer . Traditionally, in accordance with various national and international guidelines, patients are followed up at 3-month intervals in the first 3 years, and 6-month intervals thereafter, depending on their symptoms and overall clinical picture . However, this approach failed to demonstrate any significant effect on patients' survival in the UK-based prospective randomized MRC/EORTC trial, in which there was no difference in overall survival between patients who received chemotherapy based on a rising CA125 level and those who did not receive chemotherapy until they were symptomatic (Figure 10.1) . Depending on the final analysis of the DESKTOP III survival data, follow-up for ovarian cancer may need to be reshaped and redefined, as it may be worthwhile detecting the disease while it is apparently operable and when the patient has a good performance status . The emerging trend of targeted maintenance treatments for advanced ovarian cancer is also reshaping the approach to follow-up, since in this situation patients are visiting their oncologists over prolonged periods, and assessments of treatment efficacy and adverse events are performed regularly . Depending on the initial stage, the patient's wishes and reproductive history and her overall response to cancer treatment, removal of the uterus and contralateral ovary may be discussed after completion of childbearing . Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer often present with symptoms of impaired intestinal transit or clinical bowel obstruction at relapse, which is attributable to the diffuse peritoneal dissemination of recurrent tumor . The use of novel targeted therapies with anti-angiogenic potential may favor fistula formation or intestinal perforation, and so recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer with the potential for such severe acute complications constitutes a therapeutic dilemma . Palliative surgery in patients with gastrointestinal and other symptoms of ovarian cancer recurrence therefore requires a multidisciplinary approach . Any perceived benefits should be carefully balanced against the risks for each individual patient along with factors such as comorbidities, baseline quality of life, previous response to chemotherapy, length of treatment intervals and the patient's wishes . Intraoperative input from gynecologic oncologists is important to ensure that both the meaningful responses possible after palliative surgery and the likelihood of disease response to chemotherapy are duly considered when making intraoperative decisions . The severe peritoneal carcinomatosis and inflammation present in epithelial ovarian cancer recurrence makes surgical dissection hazardous, and renders the successful repair of enterotomies without fistula formation challenging . Considering the balance of risk and benefits, few patients are suitable for palliative defunctioning or bypass procedures, and therefore multidisciplinary teams with experience in managing such cases and their potential complications should be responsible for the careful selection and care of those who do undergo surgery .","The value, type and role of follow-up in cancer care is not well defined and prospective randomized trials are scarce. The type of follow-up depends on whether the patient has undergone fertility-sparing surgery. Serial CA125 measurements have failed to show any survival benefit over observation alone. Follow-up should involve holistic aspects and psycho-oncologic support. Palliative surgery should be performed only after all conservative management options have been exhausted. Short bowel syndrome is a common complication after palliative surgery for bowel obstruction in relapsed disease."
9781910797631,chp8,"Suicide rates are much higher among men than women in most regions of the world, the ratio of male to female suicides is lower in low- and middle-income countries . Many more people make suicide attempts or self-harming acts than kill themselves: self-harm is estimated to be 20 times more common than suicide, and a history of self-harm is an important risk factor for completed suicide . A marked rise in the global rate of suicide is evident in the second half of the 20th century, although the extent of this rise must be considered with caution as the data from which the baseline rate was derived were limited: 11 countries provided data for the World Health Organization (WHO) suicide mortality databank in 1950, but this had increased to more than 70 countries by the 1980s, and the rates in the more recently included countries are likely to be higher than those in the initial group . Suicide accounts for 8.5% of all deaths among young people aged 15-29 years, second only to traffic accidents; however, in high-income countries, as well as in the low- and middle-income countries of the South-East Asia region, suicide accounts for 17.6% and 16.6% respectively of deaths in this age group and is the leading cause of death . In 21 of the 30 countries in the WHO European region, suicide rates in young men aged 15-19 years rose between 1979 and 1996 . Access to lethal agents that can be means of suicide appears to be an important factor; for example, observational evidence from the UK shows a marked reduction in suicide rates associated with the change of domestic gas supply from toxic town gas to non-toxic natural gas . Although study findings are mixed, there is evidence that the 2008 economic recession was associated with increases in suicide rates, particularly among males of working age . Although a number of studies indicate that suicide rates are higher for doctors and nurses than in the general population, it appears that these do not reflect time trends . Depression seems to be the most important disease risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior among all age groups, and is present in around 60% of completed cases . In the UK and USA, the age-standardized rates of suicide among people in prison are, respectively, five and eight times higher than those for the general population . Self-harm is far more common among adolescents than any other age group: an anonymized questionnaire survey of young people from seven European countries (2008) indicated a combined lifetime prevalence of 13.5% among females and 4.3% among males . In a more recent (2017) survey of young people in England, 15.5% reported ever having self-harmed, and rates were around three times higher for females than males . Rates of self-harm peak around the age of 14-17 years, with this appearing consistent in cross-national studies . A recent review () that examined risk factors associated with suicide following an episode of self-harm identified key predictors as previous episodes of self-harm, suicidal intent, male sex and physical health problems .","Suicide is strongly associated with depression, but despite depression being more common among adult women, men are around twice as likely to kill themselves in most countries, and three to four times more likely in many high-income nations. Self-harm is most common in adolescent girls and young women and usually does not involve an intention to endanger life. Nonetheless, a history of self-harm is an important predictor of future suicide, increasing the risk by 50-100-fold compared with people who have not self-harmed. In addition to previous self-harm, risk factors for suicide include depression, substance misuse, a family history of suicide, male sex, being separated or divorced, and being in custody. Assessment practice following self-harm needs to be sensitive and skilled, focusing on the presence of risk factors for suicide and basing care plans on clearly defined risks and the capacity of the individual and their support network to manage problems and take responsibility for safety."
9781912776238,ch5,"Switching, interchangeability and extrapolation are important for the practical use of biosimilars - and surveys in Europe and the USA show that they remain among the least understood issues when it comes to biosimilars . The ability to switch patients between different brands of the same biologic is critical for developing a competitive drug market to check costs . In Europe, regulators and clinical studies have supported the practicality of brand switching between originators and biosimilars as part of the annual drug tender process - which is the European definition of 'interchangeable' . Confusingly, in the USA, automatic substitution of prescriptions at a pharmacy level is called 'interchangeability' . Automatic substitution of drugs by pharmacists is considered to create price competition between manufacturers that will reduce costs and promote patient uptake, analogous to the effect of generic substitution with small molecule drugs (Figure 5.1) . . In its guidance for industry on biosimilar interchangeability, the FDA states that a switching study or studies will generally be expected to demonstrate that, 'for a biological product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch' . To encourage biosimilar manufacturers to create the data to support automatic substitution of biosimilars, the FDA has suggested 1 year of marketing exclusivity for the first approved interchangeable biosimilar within each class . Just as automatic substitution of generic drugs was promoted in the USA through the FDA's Orange Book, listing approved substitutions, the FDA has similar listings for interchangeable biosimilars in an FDA Purple Book . In Europe, policies for automatic substitution of medicines are considered outside the role of the European Medicines Agency (EMA); despite one shared medicines regulator, generic drug substitution is mandatory in 13 countries, voluntary in 14 and forbidden in five . A-flagging denotes that brand substitution can occur at dispensing without expecting differences in clinical effect and is analogous to the US definition of interchangeable . Biosimilars are typically approved for most, if not all, the indications of the originator brand, but without a need to provide clinical trial data using the biosimilar in all those indications . The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) indicates whether indications have been approved on the basis of extrapolation or data from comparative clinical studies . By reducing the clinical trial requirement of drug regulation from proving activity in each approved indication to demonstrating equivalence in the most sensitive indication, trial requirements could be five times lower for a biosimilar; see Table 5.1 . Note that, despite the approval of an extrapolated indication for a biosimilar by Europe's regulator, this may not be available in all countries because of individual national patent laws . This is why one biosimilar approved at a European level may be marketed as bioidenticals with several brand names in individual European countries, with each bioidentical drug having approval for only a subset of the originator drug indications .","Switching between biological drugs is a key mechanism for driving down costs. 'Interchangeable' has different meanings in the USA and Europe. In the USA, interchangeability is the automatic substitution of prescriptions at a pharmacy level, whereas in Europe it refers to a physician-led decision, often at the level of the medicines formulary committee. European regulators support the safety of biosimilar switching as part of an annual tender process. In Europe, individual countries may have patent laws that prevent the extrapolation of indications for biosimilars, even if the indication has been approved by the European Medicines Agency. Similar regulations allowing for limited indications because of patent protection are also occurring in the US market."
9781910797587,chp10,"In the light of the success of surgical procedures, increasing longevity of the population and greater expectations for prolonged active lifestyles, demand for surgical interventions for OA, especially hip and knee joint replacement surgery, has risen substantially since these procedures were first undertaken approximately 45 years ago . There is little evidence on which to base the selection of suitable candidates for surgery, and ultimately the decision for surgical referral should be made by the patient in conjunction with a relevant musculoskeletal specialist who will provide information on the benefits and risks of the particular surgical intervention . A substantial body of evidence, including well-designed randomized controlled trials with sham surgery controls, indicates that arthroscopic debridement and lavage of the knee, in the absence or even in the presence of degenerative meniscal damage, does not provide benefits in pain reduction or functional improvement for patients with knee OA beyond the benefit seen with non-surgical management, and should not be recommended in most cases . Arthroscopic surgery at the hip to correct incongruency between the femoral head and acetabulum, as in femoroacetabular impingement, is increasingly performed, although little evidence exists regarding long-term outcomes or appropriate indications in the setting of concomitant degenerative joint disease . High tibial osteotomy of the knee may be useful in younger patients with medial compartment OA and early-stage radiographic disease . Evidence suggests a 25% failure rate over 10 years, with individuals often requiring knee joint replacement, but no controlled trials have been done to determine whether the procedure ultimately delays OA progression . Knee and hip replacements are amongst the most commonly performed surgical procedures . Joint replacement is arguably one of the most effective therapies for OA of the knee or hip, although the evidence for this benefit is drawn mostly from observational studies . The indications for joint replacement usually include moderate-to-severe pain that is unresponsive to non-surgical measures and radiographic evidence of severe OA structural damage . With modern techniques, 90% or more of hip and knee replacements function 10-20 years after surgery (risk of revision surgery of 1% per year), and approximately 90% of patients will get a good reduction in pain after joint replacement . Most people undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery will be able to leave the hospital after an average of 2 days, although they may need to use a walking aid such as a stick for some weeks . Recovery is greatly helped by preoperative muscle conditioning (although this may not always be practical if patients have severe degenerative joint disease prior to surgery) and adherence to postoperative rehabilitation . Benefits of this procedure compared with total joint replacement include a smaller surgical incision, shorter length of stay in hospital and quicker rehabilitation . Patellofemoral resurfacing is a relatively new technique compared with total knee replacement, but may be indicated in people who have isolated OA of the patellofemoral joint . Whilst surgery is most commonly performed for OA of the knee or hip joints, other joints may also benefit from surgical intervention .","Surgery should be considered only when appropriate non-surgical treatment approaches have been exhausted. Hip and knee replacement surgery is well established and may be one of the most effective therapies for these joints. Other surgical techniques include joint preservation and joint fusion but currently are not widely adopted in the setting of severe hip or knee osteoarthritis. Appropriate education, advice and rehabilitation should be provided, both preoperatively and postoperatively, for people undergoing surgery."
9781908541703,ch_3,"as a proportion of the treatment population, sometimes called the absolute benefit, calculated as the risk without treatment minus the risk with treatment, in this case 82.8 - 74.2 = 8.6% . Consequence or harm represents the severity of the effect of the risk event should it happen, which also carries a negative connotation . When considering individual hazards it is important to make the distinction between the proportionate risk (id est the ratio of events taking place with or without intervention) and the absolute risk (id est the likelihood of the event as a proportion of the entire population at risk) . In real terms, the background risk for women between the ages of 40 and 50 years is about 1 per 1000 per year or 1.5% on aggregate, whereas before the age of 30 years breast cancer is exceptionally rare . It is important to explain what any increase in relative risk means in real terms . It should also be viewed in the reverse and in terms of fractions - a 5% risk of developing breast cancer over the next 10 years means a 95% chance of not developing it . If a woman finds out that she has a relative risk of breast cancer that is twice that of the normal population, she may understandably panic and assume that she has a 1 in 6 chance of dying of the disease within the foreseeable future . The potential advantage of genetic testing in women with very strong family histories is that a negative result would effectively reduce the woman's risk to the level of the background population, and thus alleviate much concern and perhaps unnecessary intervention . Proportional risk is perhaps the most important concept to arise from the many trials of systemic (adjuvant) therapy for early breast cancer . Each type of treatment reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence by a relatively constant proportion . Thus, the benefit for a given woman in absolute terms depends on both the effect of treatment on the relative risk and the underlying individual risk factors . Fundamental to interpreting estimates of benefit is the understanding that the proportion being calculated relates to the number of adverse events, not the number of individuals at risk . For example, a premenopausal woman with a 1.5-cm tumor without nodal involvement may have a 10-year risk of recurrence of 10% . If adjuvant chemotherapy produces a relative risk reduction of about 30% then, in absolute terms, the patient gains 30% of the 10% risk of recurrence, which is about 3% . The treatment offers a 30% relative risk reduction, leading to an absolute benefit of 30% of 50%: a 15% decrease in the probability of recurrence within 10 years . First, the data from which these recommendations derive are generally specific for the risk of breast cancer; competing adverse risks, including the toxicity of treatment, are not considered . Thus, if the risk of an adverse event is 25%, then 1 in 4 of those who receive the treatment will experience the effect .",Risk is a poorly understood concept - it has negative connotations when in reality it is neutral. Risk measures the likelihood that an event will take place. Risk is a proportional quantity; change in risk can be expressed in absolute or relative terms. Consequence represents the severity of effect of an event. Decision-making involves balancing of risks and considering trade-offs.
9781910797082,ch05,"When deciding which product to prescribe, therapeutic efficacy must be balanced against the cosmetic acceptability and the local side-effect profile, particularly as most treatments take several weeks to reach their maximum benefit . A well-motivated patient, with adequate bathing facilities, time and perhaps someone to help with topical applications, will cope with a home-use short-contact dithranol regimen together with emollients and topical corticosteroids or a vitamin D or A analog . Potent and very potent topical corticosteroids (groups I to V in the US system) are extremely effective for chronic plaque psoriasis on the trunk, limbs and scalp, with clearance of plaques after 1-2 weeks of therapy . Continuous use of corticosteroids, particularly potent and very potent agents, may, on occasion, lead to loss of efficacy (known as tachyphylaxis) and an increased risk of significant local side effects such as cutaneous atrophy . diluting the corticosteroid and/or combining it with other active agents, such as coal tar, dithranol or salicylic acid, in a single preparation (however, the potency, and thus efficacy, of the corticosteroid in these preparations are unpredictable, particularly in non-proprietary products) . Topical corticosteroids are popular with patients, and remain first-line therapy in the USA, because of their immediate efficacy and cosmetic acceptability . Calcipotriol and the more recently introduced tacalcitol and calcitriol are all effective in chronic plaque psoriasis and can induce significant clearing of disease after 4-6 weeks (Table 5.3) . However, treatment with topical corticosteroids alone carries a significant risk of skin atrophy, tachyphylaxis and rebound psoriasis on stopping therapy . For example, long-term safety studies of tacalcitol report skin irritation in about 15% of patients, even though all sites were treated, compared with rates of 20% for calcipotriol where face and flexural sites were excluded . In an outpatient setting, coal-tar solution (5-15%) in combination with a topical corticosteroid, such as betamethasone valerate (0.025%), is a useful topical preparation for chronic plaque psoriasis . To date, long-term studies of patients with psoriasis treated with coal-tar products have not shown an increased incidence of cancer . Licensed in the UK and USA in 1998, tazarotene was the first topical retinoid to become available for the treatment of mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis affecting less than 20% of the body surface area . In terms of overall treatment success, both concentrations of tazarotene gel have similar efficacy to twice-daily fluocinonide (0.05%) cream, a potent topical corticosteroid, following 12 weeks' therapy . Predictably, patients treated with the topical corticosteroid relapsed quickly after cessation of therapy, whereas the therapeutic benefit of tazarotene was sustained during the 12-week follow-up period . Combining tazarotene with a topical corticosteroid enhances speed of response and overall efficacy, and also reduces retinoid-induced skin irritation . Therefore, moderate potency or stronger corticosteroids, tazarotene, calcipotriol, crude or high-concentration coal tar and dithranol are unsuitable . A mild corticosteroid, with or without coal-tar solution (1%), and with or without a topical agent active against Pityrosporum yeasts, such as ketoconazole or clotrimazole, may be used, particularly in cases of sebo-psoriasis .","Approximately 70% of patients (those with mild or moderate disease) can be managed using topical therapy alone. Time spent detailing the practicalities of topical therapy with patients is crucial to achieving a successful therapeutic outcome. A wide variety of topical therapies is available; topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogs, or a combination of both in a single preparation, are considered first-line therapy for most patients. Efficacy and cosmetic acceptability are key determinants of patients' adherence to therapy. Consideration should be given to the body site being treated, since this influences which active ingredient and formulation to prescribe."
9781910797471,ch06,"In order to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs, multidisciplinary HF management programs have been designed for patients with severe symptomatic HF, which unify and coordinate their care throughout their illness and within the various service-delivery systems (id est the hospital, outpatient clinic and community setting) . In general, management programs do not include diagnosed patients with mild symptoms (no effect on outcomes), those with HF and preserved systolic function (no available evidence) or severely ill patients at the end stage of the disease (in need of a palliative care approach - see Chapter 9) . Programs that focus on enhancing patient self-care activities, reduce HF and all-cause hospitalizations but have no effect on mortality . Remote monitoring programs (including telemonitoring or structured telephone support - see below) reduce the rates of admission to hospital for chronic HF and all-cause mortality . Although implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, are capable of providing real-time information on a daily basis, such as heart-rate variability, patient-activity status and assessment of lung fluid volume, they have yet to provide sufficiently accurate predictive data . It is therefore essential that all patients with HF and those who care for them receive comprehensive education and counseling to develop the knowledge, skills, strategies, problem-solving approaches and motivation required to adhere to a complex treatment plan and effectively participate in HF self-care . Self-care management is a cognitive process that involves the recognition of signs and symptoms of worsening HF, evaluation of the importance of a change in symptoms, implementation of a self-care strategy (such as increasing diuretic medication) and evaluating the effectiveness of any changes . Patients and their carers should be instructed to contact their healthcare practitioner or HF nurse if weight increases or decreases unexpectedly by more than 2 kg over 2 or 3 consecutive days as they may need further assessment or a change to their diuretic regimen . If patients have demonstrated the ability to self-care, it may be appropriate for them to regulate their own diuretic dose based on daily weight monitoring and assessment of HF symptoms . Provisional evidence also suggests that regular exercise, which is considered a safe and cost-effective intervention, may reduce hospital admissions and improve survival . Regular physical activity is strongly recommended for all medically stable patients with HF unless they are in NYHA class IV or have other limiting symptoms such as angina (Table 6.2) . All medically stable patients should be considered for a structured, specifically designed exercise and rehabilitation program that incorporates both an aerobic component of low-to-moderate intensity (exempli gratia walking, cycling) for most days of the week and strengthening exercises comprising light weights and stretching . Depression is related to a reduction in self-care activities, increased hospitalization and reduced survival . Two studies have shown that in patients with class III-IV NYHA HF with ejection fractions less than 40%, controllable hypoxia increased blood pressure and positive airway pressure and lowered ventricular filling pressures, but did not cause any significant symptoms or change to workload .","General non-pharmacological strategies, including self-care education, treatment adherence, symptom recognition, weight control, sodium and fluid management and healthy lifestyle choices are as important as heart failure (HF)-specific medications. Patients with HF appear to benefit from exercise as much as others, with a documented improvement in quality of life and a tendency towards reductions in morbidity and mortality. Patients with a private driving license are generally restricted from driving only if they have advanced or uncontrolled HF; those with a commercial driving license are banned from driving until further testing. Most patients who have had an episode of acute HF should be able to fly, if stable, in 6 weeks. There should be no restriction for patients with chronic HF, although those with NYHA class III or IV should consider airport assistance and request the availability of in-flight oxygen. In general, there is no convincing evidence that electromagnetic interference, cosmic radiation or vibration have an important effect on the function of pacemakers or implantable cardiac defibrillators."
9781912776696,hh-4,"The type of statistical method used to analyze trial data depends on the type of endpoint that is measured . Continuous endpoints are measured on a continuum of possible values over time: for example, a change in bone mineral density or blood pressure . Many endpoints in oncology measure the time to event (see Chapter 2) . Time-to-event endpoints are usually measured from the point of randomization, but not always . Usually, the sample's average (mean), middle (median) or most common (mode) value is used . The mean is a good measure of comparison to use for sample groups with continuous and score endpoints, provided the endpoint data have a symmetric distribution (Figure 1.1a) . The mean is also a good measure of comparison for samples with count endpoints, but these are usually calculated as means per unit of time to account for different observation periods for different patients . When the data distribution is skewed (see Figure 1.1b, c), id est some of the values are a lot smaller or larger than the others, the mean is not usually the best measure of average . Proportions for ordered categorical endpoints are also compared between treatment groups, but in such cases the order needs to be taken into account; the statistical procedures that are used take account of the order . If the trial was repeated with the same protocol and same investigators but with a new set of patients, there would be a different numerical value for the difference between the means because of patient-to-patient variability in the outcome . If the trial above was conducted 100 times, 100 values for the difference in the treatment means would be obtained . The SE is an important measure, as it is used to calculate confidence intervals and p -values . To test for superiority, id est to demonstrate that treatments are different, the null hypothesis (H) is that the treatment effects (exempli gratia the mean effects) are equal . The p -value is a number between 0 and 1 that is a measure of how much evidence there is to accept or reject the null hypothesis (Table 1.1) . If the p -value is above 0.05 then the difference is deemed to be non-significant and the null hypothesis is accepted . When the hypothesis is constructed in this one-sided way, a one-sided p -value is calculated that only achieves statistical significance if the treatment effect is in favor of the experimental treatment (A+B+C compared to B+C) . Treatment differences can also be expressed in terms of ratios; for example, differences for time-to-event endpoints are expressed in terms of hazard ratios (see Chapter 2) . Odds ratios (ORs) and relative risks (RRs) are used to express treatment differences when dealing with binary endpoints . For comparison of two treatment means for continuous or score endpoints, the appropriate test is the two-sample t -test . When normality cannot be recovered through a data transformation, a non-parametric test can be used to obtain the p -value .","The type of statistical method used to analyze trial data depends on the type of endpoint being measured. Common endpoint types are continuous, score, binary, ordered categorical, count and time to event. Summary statistics provide a simple descriptive value for a data sample, which enables comparison of data sets. The mean (arithmetic average) is the most common measure used for continuous and score data with a normal or symmetric distribution. The median is the preferred measure for data with a skewed distribution. Proportions are compared for binary and ordered categorical endpoints. The standard deviation is a measure of patient-to-patient variability. The standard error is a measure of the extent of sampling variation. A 95% confidence interval is a range of values within which the true population value lies 95% of the time. The null hypothesis usually states that treatment effects are equal. The alternative hypothesis is that they are not equal. These hypotheses give two-sided p -values. One-sided p -values can be obtained when looking for differences only in one direction. The p -value is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates whether to accept the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis. For two-sided testing, a p -value <= 0.05 shows that there is statistically significant evidence against the null hypothesis, id est there is a statistically significant difference between the treatments. The odds ratio (OR) and relative risk (RR) are used to express the difference between binary endpoints. OR > 1 or RR > 1 indicates that the odds or risk of an event occurring, respectively, are higher in the treatment group. The two-sample t -test is used to analyze data with a normal or approximately normal distribution. Skewed data sets can be transformed (exempli gratia by log) before analysis with the t -test, or analyzed using a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U -test."
9781910797556,chp4,"Given the fluctuations in severity of symptoms in patients with MG, there are inherent difficulties in assessing baseline disease severity and response to treatment . Electrophysiological studies, disease severity rating scales and patient-reported outcome measures are all tools with which disease activity and response to treatment have been measured in MG . Intuitively, the measurement of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titers serves as an attractive biomarker to discern disease activity and response to treatment in patients with MG . Better prognostic biomarkers for MG are needed to more sensitively determine which treatments might work better for specific patients, to better assess the response to treatment over time and for use in clinical trial design in studies of MG . One recent study found that jitter is a sensitive measure of disease severity in MG; absolute or percentage change in mean jitter from one electrophysiological study to another in a given patient has a potential role as a biomarker . Another study showed that high jitter values on SFEMG and decrement values on repetitive nerve stimulation were associated with more severe disease, as determined by more frequent subjective and objective measures of muscle strength and worse quantitative MG score (see below) . Several clinical rating instruments have been developed to measure disease severity and quality of life, in patients with MG . The quantitative MG score (QMG) is the best studied objective outcome measure in MG, and it has been used in many drug trials in MG . The MG activities of daily living score (MG-ADL) is a simple eight-point questionnaire, designed to complement the QMG, which enquires about common symptoms reported by patients with MG (Table 4.2) . Widely used in many studies, the MG-ADL correlates well with the QMG and can serve as a measure of efficacy in clinical trials . The MG composite scale (MGC) consists of test items that measure symptoms and signs of MG, with weighted response options to highlight aspects of weakness that may be more serious such as bulbar and respiratory function . It was devised using individual test items taken from existing MG-specific scales based on their performance during two clinical trials of mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of MG . The MGC consists of a combination of physician-measured signs and patient-reported symptoms (Table 4.3) . Measures of health-related quality of life attempt to ascertain a patient's subjective determination of the extent of dysfunction caused by disease and their degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with that dysfunction . It can also be used to follow an individual patient's response over time to assist in assessing the degree of disease severity and to determine the efficacy of treatment, controlling for other potential confounding factors . In addition, like the other scales discussed, the MG-QOL15 has served to assist in following groups of patients with MG over time in clinical trials . MGII scores have been found to correlate well with other validated scales discussed above, including the QMG, MG-ADL, MGC and MG-QOL15 .","Electrophysiological studies, disease severity rating scales and patient-reported outcome measures are all tools with which disease activity and response to treatment can be measured in myasthenia gravis (MG). There is no reliable correlation between serum acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody titers and clinical severity in generalized MG; better prognostic biomarkers for MG are needed to better assess response to treatment over time. Measurement of jitter on single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) may be a useful biomarker of disease activity in MG. Absolute or percentage change in mean jitter from one electrophysiological study to another has a potential role as a biomarker provided the parameters of the study, such as time of day and time after medication, are kept the same. The quantitative MG score, which can be completed in 20-30 minutes and requires no specialized equipment, is the best studied objective outcome measure in MG. It is recommended for use in all prospective studies of therapy for MG. Other useful tools for assessing response to treatment include the MG activities of daily living score (MG-ADL), MG composite scale (MGC), revised MG quality of life 15 scale (MG-QOL15R), MG impairment index (MGII) and MGFA assessment of post-intervention status (PIS)."
9783318066685,ch5,"Gene editing is the manipulation of the genetic material of a living cell or organism by the disruption, deletion, correction or insertion of a DNA sequence . Once made, DSBs activate one of the host cell's two main DNA repair systems: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed recombination (HDR) (Figure 5.1) . In contrast, HDR machinery operates mainly during the S and G2 cell cycle phases, utilizes a donor template with homology sequences to DSB sites, which is naturally the sister chromatid, and directs efficient site-specific strand exchange and repair . Such DSBs can be generated using several different programmable endonuclease systems: meganucleases (MNs), zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) (Figure 5.2 and Table 5.1) . The MN gene-editing platform utilizes homing endonucleases, such as I- Cre I and I- Sce I, but re-engineers them to target novel specific genomic sites . Nevertheless, the exploitation of this technology has been restricted, mainly as a result of the high degree of protein engineering required to generate MNs with novel target specificity . Multifinger arrays, comprising multiple ZF domains linked in tandem, can be generated with novel and unique genomic target specificities . Since their development, ZFNs have been used for genome modification via both NHEJ or HDR repair pathways, and positive editing has been achieved in human cells . A disadvantage of ZFNs is that the targeting of new sites requires a high level of protein engineering, which makes it challenging for non-specialists to utilize the platform . Subsequently, as with ZFs, TALEs have been fused to the Fok l restriction endonuclease domain, generating programmable TALENs that function as pairs for the introduction of DSBs . Following the introduction of site-specific DSBs by any of the programmable nuclease systems described, various types of genomic alterations can be exploited as prospective therapies, utilizing either the endogenous NHEJ or HDR DNA repair machinery . These gene-editing approaches can disrupt, delete or correct genetic sequences that cause disease, as well as insert exogenous therapeutic DNA sequences (Figure 5.3) . Deletion of large genomic sequences, even at multiple megabase sizes, can be achieved by the simultaneous generation of two DSBs flanking the target . HDR can be induced for precise and efficient gene correction of disease-causing mutations by targeted generation of a DSB along with the supply of an exogenous DNA repair template . Therapeutic gene correction approaches have been in development for the repair of mutations causing a range of different human immunodeficiencies, including X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency . In addition, large DNA sequences, such as therapeutic transgenes or missing exonic sequences, flanked by arms of homology can be inserted into specific target sites using a donor template via DSB-induced HDR . Alternatively, for potential treatment of DMD caused by mutation in the DMD gene whereby one or more exons are deleted, strategies have been developed to insert the missing exons to restore the correct coding sequence and protein function .","Engineered endonucleases can be designed to target virtually any DNA sequence of choice using bioinformatics tools. There are distinct advantages and disadvantages associated with each type of endonuclease. The endonuclease-mediated double-strand break (DSB) in the DNA is repaired by two mechanisms: efficient but imprecise non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or inefficient but precise homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ and HDR mechanisms can be exploited to repair loss-of-function mutations or disrupt gain-of-function mutations. Ex vivo and in situ in vivo applications of gene editing are being tested in the clinic, with a number of systemic in vivo trials starting."
9781910797662,ch04,"Physical examination is usually unremarkable in cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) unless acute urinary retention is present with bladder distension . Bladder tumor antigen (BTA) stat ® test is performed on unmodified (unbuffered) urine using a similar method to pregnancy tests, and results are available within 5 minutes . The test, which can be performed at the time of cystoscopy, is claimed to be approximately twice as sensitive as cytology, and is particularly effective for detecting the low- and intermediate-grade tumors that cytology misses . One study showed substantial cost savings if patients with a positive BTA stat test result did not undergo flexible cystoscopy but instead were taken directly to anesthesia and rigid cystoscopy for possible resection, even allowing for a few with negative results on rigid cystoscopy (id est false-positive BTA stat tests) . Current consensus is that none of the tests alone is sufficiently sensitive to replace cystoscopy in diagnosing or excluding urinary bladder cancer . The upper tracts (ureter and renal pelvis) should be imaged in all patients with symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer . In the investigation of hematuria (the most common presentation of bladder cancer), contemporary imaging can be performed by computed tomographic urography (CTU) (Figure 4.1),, which has replaced intravenous urography . If a patient is found to have low-grade bladder cancer on biopsy, no further imaging is required . Bone scans are indicated only for patients with invasive disease who have symptoms suggesting bone involvement (id est pain) or in the presence of elevated bone markers (alkaline phosphatase) . Diagnostic cystoscopy may be omitted if a bladder tumor is obvious on cross-sectional imaging; however, most urologists perform the procedure in order to inform surgical management, and it allows the patient to be informed of the likely diagnosis of bladder cancer . When a bladder tumor is identified by imaging or cystoscopy, the next step is to perform a transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) under general anesthesia using a rigid cystoscope . In patients with an apparent muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), the goals are to establish the histological subtype and depth of penetration and to exclude involvement of the urethra . When a bladder tumor is diagnosed, cytology is useful to determine the grade as, by definition, positive cytology denotes high-grade malignant cells . A bladder wash for cytology should be obtained at the time of cystoscopy, as this is the most sensitive means for detection of bladder cancer particularly if areas that might be carcinoma in situ (CIS) or ulcers rather than obvious papillary or exophytic solid tumor are seen . Complete resection may be possible if the tumor is small, papillary or solid, and even if it has invaded the muscle (Figure 4.2) . Mucosal biopsies should be performed in selected cases to rule out or diagnose associated field changes (see page 19) in the case of high-grade cancers (Figure 4.3) . Biopsies might also be obtained circumferentially around small, solid, apparently invasive tumors away from the bladder base or bladder neck in selected cases where partial cystectomy might be considered for definitive therapy .","The investigation of a patient with suspected bladder cancer should include urinalysis, cross-sectional upper-tract imaging and cystoscopy. Expert pathological review of biopsy specimens is critical to determining appropriate treatment. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) is used to stage invasive disease. Urinary markers are not yet sufficiently sensitive for diagnosis but may be useful in following up patients with superficial disease."
9781910797310,chp1,"The number of cigarettes smoked, but more importantly the length of time that patients have smoked for, is proportional to the risk of developing lung cancer . Evidence from the landmark 1964 Surgeon General's report estimated that an average male smoker had a nine- to tenfold increased risk of developing lung cancer compared with a 'never smoker' . Individual susceptibility to developing lung cancer is affected by genetic predisposition and other environmental factors . Many occupational exposures increase the risk of developing lung cancer (Table 1.1) . Patients with a first-degree relative with lung cancer have a 50% increased risk of developing lung cancer . Genome-wide association studies have shown that a major susceptibility locus on chromosome 6q (6q23-25p) is associated with increased lung cancer risk . Targeting genetically high-risk individuals for intensive smoking cessation and screening programs may be the focus for future lung cancer prevention strategies . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with lung cancer risk . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is also associated with a sevenfold increase in lung cancer risk . A meta-analysis of diabetic patients has shown an increased lung cancer risk, especially in women . Cohort studies have shown increased risk following non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, testicular cancer, uterine sarcomas and head and neck cancers . Patients who have had radiation therapy for thoracic malignancies (exempli gratia lymphomas) are at increased risk of lung cancer; smoking further increases the risk . In patients with breast cancer who have never smoked, postmastectomy radiotherapy is associated with an almost twofold increase in lung cancer risk in the ipsilateral lung but not the contralateral lung . Patients with HIV infection have consistently been shown to have increased rates of lung cancer and are diagnosed at an earlier age . Although the prevalence of cigarette smoking within the HIV-positive population is higher than the general population, a meta-analysis revealed a 2.5-fold increased risk of developing lung cancer in HIV-positive patients independent of smoking status . A systematic review by the World Cancer Research Fund found 'probable' evidence that greater levels of fruit, and to a lesser extent vegetable consumption, are inversely associated with lung cancer risk . A recent Cochrane review found no evidence that vitamin D supplementation had any effect on lung cancer risk . Although mass screening of high-risk asymptomatic patients has the potential to detect disease at an earlier stage, randomized trials using chest X-ray (CXR) have not shown a reduction in lung-cancer mortality . The largest of these, the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), in which 53 454 current and former smokers (> 30 pack-years) aged 55-74 years were randomized to LDCT or CXR, showed a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer-related mortality and a 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality in patients screened by LDCT . The large Dutch-Belgian NELSON trial randomized 15 882 lower-risk participants (age 50-75 years, 15 pack-years, smoking within 10 years of trial) to annual LDCT or a control arm . The NELSON trial benefited from the use of volumetric analysis and volume doubling time assessment to determine interval growth of indeterminate pulmonary nodules .","Tobacco smoke exposure accounts for 90% of all lung cancers. Smoking prevention and cessation represents the major target for prevention of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The National Lung Screening Trial showed that low-dose CT screening of high-risk individuals reduced the risk of lung cancer-related mortality by 20%. The management of solitary pulmonary nodules is dependent on their risk stratification, evidence of growth on interval imaging (ideally using volumetric measurement) and patient comorbidities and choices."
9781910797471,ch09,"Prognosis of HF in individual patients is challenging as a number of independent variables must be considered, including symptoms, severity, etiology and type of HF . In general, patients with NYHA class IV symptoms, and HF caused by infiltrative heart disease, HIV infection or anthracycline toxicity, with systolic left ventricular (LV) or biventricular dysfunction, have the worse prognosis . Initial assessment in patients with HF should include a review of the prognosis but, importantly, a search for reversible factors contributing to disease progression (Table 9.2) . If any of these problems are identified, prompt and comprehensive treatment should improve HF symptoms, in many cases arrest disease progression and improve prognosis . Palliative care improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness . This is accomplished by the prevention and relief of symptoms, including early identification, assessment and treatment of pain and other physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems (Table 9.3) . The quality of life of patients with advanced HF refractory to optimal pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies can be very poor and comparable with that of patients with terminal malignancies, with a case-fatality rate of 75% over 5 years overall . Chronic disease management strategies include education, monitoring, prevention and effective therapy (see earlier chapters) . Patients and their families (carers) should be fully informed about the nature of the disease including treatment and prognosis, with regular monitoring and appropriate review . A careful review of the patient's symptoms and all the available treatment options should be performed by the specialist in consultation with the patient's family practitioner and a palliative care specialist, using robust clinical identifiers of poor prognosis (Table 9.4) . If the patient assessment indicates the need for palliative care, management should shift to symptom control (Table 9.5) . Patients and their families or carers may require assistance in negotiating the change in goals of care from prolongation of life to improvement of quality of life by maximizing comfort and dignity . Time should be set aside to discuss the prognosis, course of the illness and palliative-care strategies in detail with the patient and carer . Palliative-care strategies should build on, rather than replace, multidisciplinary programs of care that optimize advanced HF management . An advance care plan is often documented and the ways of managing future clinical deterioration discussed with the patient . The existence and process of obtaining such a legal document should be discussed with the patient and their carers early in the course of advanced HF . As the patient's condition deteriorates, the healthcare team should discuss any changes to the goals of medical therapy with the patient and family . In these circumstances, the patient's quality of life should be paramount, and in many instances deactivation of the device may need to be discussed . In many instances the 'not-for-resuscitation' status and arrangements for terminal care are also reviewed at this time (see below) . Terminal care continues as the patient presents with intractable HF, with resting symptoms, poor appetite, weight loss, slow mental activity and low blood pressure with end-organ failure (exempli gratia kidney failure) .","Heart failure (HF) has a poor prognosis with an annual mortality of 25-50% depending on severity of symptoms and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Poor prognostic signs include impaired renal function, marked prolongation of QRS, hypotension and hyponatremia. The search for reversible factors is always indicated. The model of palliative care for advanced HF needs to be very flexible, individualized to the needs of the patient and their family. Good communication skills are the key to effective palliative care delivery. Primary care, cardiology and palliative care teams should work in collaboration to deliver an effective phase-specific treatment in advanced HF. End-of-life planning and decision making are essential and should be discussed early in the process."
9781908541994,ch06,"Effective systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe types of acne include antibiotics, hormonal therapies for women and isotretinoin . Table 6.1 summarizes the range of oral antibiotics available for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne and the appropriate dosage for each drug . Systemic antibiotics, in association with combinations of topical therapies (a retinoid and benzoyl peroxide), are a key element in the treatment of moderate and moderate-to-severe acne that does not respond to topical treatments alone (see Choosing the right treatment, page 85) . Second-generation tetracyclines - doxycycline, lymecycline and minocycline - are widely recognized as the first oral antibiotic of choice for the treatment of acne . A recently published study indicated that doxycycline, 200 mg daily, administered with a fixed topical combination of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide (BPO) for 20 weeks is a good alternative to oral isotretinoin in severe cases of acne . The concurrent use of lymecycline with the fixed topical combination of adapalene and BPO is beneficial in patients with moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris . However, based on concerns about its safety compared with other tetracyclines, a recent Cochrane review found no reliable evidence to consider minocycline as a first-line oral antibiotic therapy in patients with acne . In view of the potential risks of minocycline, which also include pseudotumor cerebri syndrome (previously known as benign intracranial hypertension), pigmentation of skin, sclera and bone, autoimmune hepatitis, serum sickness-like reactions and drug-induced lupus, it is important to counsel patients to report any symptoms associated with their therapy . The physician should perform a review of symptoms at follow-up appointments to encompass these potential side effects, in addition to physical examination of the skin, sclera and oral cavity for signs of pigment deposition, which may occur in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods of time . In general, the oral antibiotics used in acne are rarely associated with side effects . Trimethoprim is an alternative systemic antibiotic that can be used as third-line therapy for the treatment of acne at a dose of 200-300 mg twice daily . All combined oral contraceptives have been shown to have a positive effect in women with acne . All combined oral contraceptives, including those used to treat acne, have similar side effects and contraindications (Table 6.2) . ' Newer formulations of contraceptives with a low dosage of EE (20-35 m g; 15 m g in some cases) have reduced the risk of estrogen-related side effects . Starting patients with a low dosage and progressively increasing it may reduce the occurrence of severe side effects . In doses of 50-100 mg once or twice daily, taken with meals, spironolactone has been shown to reduce sebum production (by 30-50%) and improve acne . The number of patients with moderate acne who are treated with isotretinoin because of an inadequate response to standard therapy has significantly increased in the past few years . By continuing treatment for at least 1 month after clearance, one study reported a comparable relapse rate to patients with severe acne receiving 120-150 mg/kg . Pseudotumor cerebri is a potential rare side effect, which may occur in patients receiving oral isotretinoin .","Systemic antibiotics remain useful therapy for inflammatory acne. Antibiotic-resistant Propionibacterium acnes is an emerging problem, and prescribing should take this important factor into account. Antiandrogen hormonal therapy may be helpful in female patients. Oral isotretinoin should be considered in patients with severe scarring acne and those who have relapsed or are not responding to conventional therapy. Oral isotretinoin is teratogenic; careful monitoring is mandatory. Mood changes, depression and suicidal ideation have been described in patients taking isotretinoin, but the drug has not been shown to be the cause; nevertheless, patients should be informed of the possibility."
9781908541796,chapter5,"The aggressive B-cell lymphomas (also known as high-grade B-cell lymphomas) include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and lymphoblastic lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (see page 80) . Another subtype of lymphoma has therefore been identified, known for now as 'aggressive B-cell lymphoma with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma' . Molecular profiling using expression microarrays (see page 37) has identified two main types of DLBCL, namely those derived from germinal-center B cells (GCB subtype) and those derived from a more differentiated stage in the B-cell life cycle - activated B-cell (ABC) type . Although outcome is partly dependent on the extent of disease at presentation, treatment is usually with combination chemotherapy, such as R-CHOP, regardless of clinical stage . Those patients who do not achieve complete remission by the completion of their fourth course of R-CHOP may be considered to have refractory disease in this setting, and the possibility of using salvage regimens should be discussed . Patients with aggressive subtypes of DLBCL such as c-Myc -positive DLBCL, which has a high cell proliferation rate, tend to fare poorly with standard treatment compared with those who have c-Myc -negative disease . The key consideration is response, because patients achieving a satisfactory response may then benefit from high-dose therapy and peripheral stem-cell rescue (Figure 5.2) . R-ESHAP is an excellent stem-cell mobilizer, but has a long-term survival rate (over 5 years) of only 20% when used as the sole therapeutic agent (id est without subsequent high-dose therapy) . As suggested above, patients who have relapsed do better if they are able to receive high-dose therapy (see page 115), as long as they achieved a satisfactory response to the initial salvage chemotherapy . Patients with involvement of two or more extranodal sites together with a raised LDH are at particular risk of relapse in the CNS . This area of lymphoma management is controversial, but most centers invoke some form of prophylaxis for patients thought to be at risk of CNS involvement . The large tumor bulk often seen in these patients is reflected in very high levels of LDH in some cases . Burkitt lymphoma requires treatment with high-dose sequential chemotherapy . Cure rates of 65-80% can be achieved when sequential chemotherapy is delivered such as CODOX-M or, for higher-risk patients (high LDH and advanced stage) CODOX-M/IVAC . Primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma is a rare aggressive locally invasive lymphoma that presents in young adults and more commonly in women . Mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma presents a fairly distinct immunophenotype . Furthermore, unlike DLBCL, primary B-cell mediastinal lymphomas do not show rearrangements of either the BCL2 or BCL6 genes . Interestingly, gene-expression microarray studies show that the signature of mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is more like that of classic Hodgkin lymphoma than that of DLBCL . Studies have found that primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma has a favorable outcome compared with DLBCL . Most centers treat mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma using a DLBCL protocol (R-CHOP), though others may use infusional regimens based on the excellent outcome data with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R .","The commonest aggressive B-cell lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Most DLBCL express CD20, which is the target for rituximab; approximately 50% of DLBCL are curable with R-CHOP. Patients who relapse require salvage chemotherapy and, if chemosensitive, will benefit from high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell rescue. Burkitt lymphoma and the c-Myc -positive DLBCL subtype have high proliferation rates and should be treated with sequential chemotherapy incorporating central nervous system prophylaxis."
9781910797150,ch02,"Types of CINV and risk factors . Types of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting . Nausea and vomiting may occur any time after the administration of chemotherapy, but the mechanisms appear different for CINV that occurs in the first 24 hours after chemotherapy compared with CINV that occurs 1-5 days after chemotherapy (Table 2.1) . Acute CINV is nausea and/or vomiting that occurs within the first 24 hours of chemotherapy administration . It can start within 1 or 2 hours of chemotherapy being administered and can last for several hours, with maximal intensity 5-6 hours after drug administration . The incidence (see page 19), severity and quantity of acute emesis and/or nausea varies depending on several treatment-related factors including the emetogenicity and dosage of the chemotherapy (see Chapter 4) and a number of patient-related factors (see Risk factors below) . Delayed CINV is arbitrarily defined as nausea and/or vomiting that develops more than 24 hours after chemotherapy administration . Delayed CINV is typically associated with the administration of cisplatin, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide and can occur days 2 to 7 after chemotherapy . Other predictive factors include the dose and the emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agent (see Chapter 4), patient sex and age, and protection against nausea and vomiting in previous cycles of chemotherapy . For cisplatin, which has been most extensively studied, delayed emesis reaches peak intensity 2-3 days after chemotherapy administration and can last up to a week if not treated . Breakthrough CINV is vomiting and/or nausea that occurs within 5 days of chemotherapy despite appropriate guideline-directed use of prophylactic antiemetic agents . Refractory CINV is vomiting and/or nausea that occurs after chemotherapy in subsequent chemotherapy cycles when guideline-directed antiemetic prophylaxis and/or rescue treatment have failed in earlier cycles . Patients who experience CINV may develop a conditioned response known as anticipatory nausea and/or vomiting before the administration of chemotherapy in future chemotherapy cycles . Risk factors for CINV include features of the treatment itself as well as a number of patient characteristics . Treatment risk factors . the emetogenicity of chemotherapy agents (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2, pages 54-7) . the doses of chemotherapy administered (see Table 4.3, page 59) . Patient characteristics also influence the potential for CINV (Table 2.2) . These patients should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen available based on the international antiemetic guidelines (see Chapter 4) . Despite the use of guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics, CINV can occur with relatively high frequency in high-risk patients (20-25% acute, 50-70% delayed, 50% breakthrough and 30% refractory) . Patients who are scheduled to receive their first course of chemotherapy should be individually evaluated for their specific risk factors and prescribed appropriate antiemetics (see Chapter 7) . The use of antiemetic agents, as recommended by international guidelines, has been shown to prevent emesis in approximately 50-70% of patients receiving either highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy . Although the onset and duration of symptoms usually points to chemotherapy as the cause, other potential aggravating factors that may cause nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer should be considered (Table 2.3) .","The different types of CINV are classified according to the time interval at which nausea and vomiting occurs in relation to the administration of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy agents vary in their emetogenicity; for example, cisplatin has high emetogenic potential and causes CINV in almost all patients who do not receive antiemetic prophylaxis. Important individual patient characteristics contribute to the risk of developing CINV. Despite guideline-directed antiemetic prophylaxis, CINV can occur with relatively high frequency in high-risk patients (20-25% acute CINV, 50-70% delayed CINV, 50% breakthrough CINV and 30% refractory CINV). The guideline-directed use of antiemetic agents has been shown to prevent emesis in approximately 50-70% of patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. The prevention of nausea has been much less successful with currently approved agents."
9781910797433,ch06,"Most patients with ovarian cancer present at advanced stages of disease, and thus require chemotherapy . Patients with stage I grade 2 disease are sometimes excluded from adjuvant treatment, and the number of cycles prescribed is sometimes reduced in such cases . The adjuvant treatment of ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers is complex in that multiple standards of care exist (Figure 6.2) . 'standard chemotherapy': platinum-based therapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) administered intravenously every 3 weeks . 'dose-dense' chemotherapy: a platinum agent administered intravenously every 3 weeks with a weekly taxane . The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is the current standard of care for first-line chemotherapy in ovarian cancer . As shown in Figure 6.2, the first treatment decision for patients with ovarian cancer is the timing of surgery . Most clinicians will opt for neoadjuvant therapy if the patient is judged to be a poor surgical risk, such as those of very advanced age, with significant comorbid conditions or who have a poor performance status . Two landmark Phase III trials have shown that interval cytoreduction after initial chemotherapy is a viable option in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer . The authors concluded that neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not inferior to primary debulking surgery, and that administration of chemotherapy before surgery is an acceptable standard of care for women with advanced ovarian cancer . As a result of these studies, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) issued a joint guidance statement on the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer . According to these guidelines, a key component in the choice of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy (in addition to patient comorbidities) is the ability to cytoreduce, based upon tumor distribution . A large Phase III randomized trial showed superiority for this dose-dense approach using the weekly paclitaxel schedule . There was no statistically significant advantage in terms of OS or PFS compared with standard therapy, but the paclitaxel dose (60 mg/m) was lower than that normally used in dose-dense regimens . More recently, the GOG262 study, which explored the dose-dense approach versus 3-weekly paclitaxel with the option of bevacizumab administration, showed no advantage in terms of PFS with dose-dense therapy; however, in a post hoc analysis of the group who opted not to receive bevacizumab (approximately 15% of the population), there was a statistically significant difference in PFS favoring dose-dense chemotherapy . Two large Phase III trials that explored the concept of adding bevacizumab to front-line treatment for ovarian cancer met their primary endpoint of improving PFS, but neither showed an improvement in OS . However, to date the GOG252 trial has not shown an advantage for IP therapy in terms of the primary endpoint, PFS; it has been suggested that the lower doses of drug used in this study, and the use of bevacizumab in all three arms of the trial, may have confounded the efficacy results . Among the current standards of care, the choice of therapy is generally based on a number of considerations, including .","Most patients with ovarian cancer present at advanced stages of disease, and thus require chemotherapy. The combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is the standard of care for the front-line treatment of ovarian cancer. Options for adjuvant therapy include standard chemotherapy, dose-dense chemotherapy and intraperitoneal treatment. A key component in the choice of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy is the ability to cytoreduce, ideally to 'no gross residual tumor'. Women who have a high perioperative risk profile or a low likelihood of achieving cytoreduction to less than 1 cm (ideally to no visible disease) should receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among the current standards of care, the choice of therapy is generally based on a number of considerations, including patient characteristics, physician preference and regulatory status."
9781910797297,chp5,"Survival may also be worse with increasing age, which may reflect reduced innate immunity . Most patients with MF present with early-stage disease characterized by a long disease course but substantial morbidity (pain, pruritus, scaling), and cosmetic disfigurement may be considerable . Thirty percent of patients with MF and all those with Sézary syndrome (SS) present with advanced-stage disease, and in addition 25% with early MF will progress to advanced disease . It provided prognostic information, but there were inconsistencies; for example, median survival in stage IIB was worse than that for stage III, and patients with folliculotropic patch/plaque (stage IB) MF had a worse prognosis than those with tumor-stage disease (stage IIB) . This revised staging introduced a blood classification (B0-2) alongside the conventional tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) categories . The TNMB system uses tumor (T1-4), nodal (N0-3), metastasis (M0-1) and blood (B0-2) classification to produce nine stages from IA-IVB and provides prognostic information (see Table 5.1) . Patients with early-stage disease tend to have a favorable prognosis of more than a decade and are managed with skin-directed therapy or a 'wait and see'/'expectant' approach . Patients with late-stage disease tend to have an aggressive clinical course and typically need systemic therapy . A crude distinction between stage T1 and T2 disease is dependent on involvement of more than 10% of body surface area, while T4 is defined as more than 80% involvement . Use of the modified severity weighted assessment tool (mSWAT) provides additional information to staging in MF/SS . While there are always problems with any type of scoring system, the mSWAT score allows disease tumor burden to be accurately recorded to assess responses to treatment, and is useful in clinical trials . Patient survival according to stage of disease was reported in a recent London cohort of more than 1500 patients . Early-stage disease (IA-IIA) had a long median survival of 16-35 years and 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) of 89-98% (Table 5.2) . Signs in early-stage disease that indicated a better prognosis in this and other studies included presenting at a young age, poikiloderma, hypopigmentation and the association of lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) . A large international multicenter study of 1275 patients with advanced-stage MF/SS reported survival of 63 months, with 2- and 5-year survival rates of 77% and 52%, respectively . This study tested ten candidate prognostic markers (stage, age, sex, cutaneous histological features of folliculotropism, CD30 positivity, proliferation index, large cell transformation, white blood cell/lymphocyte count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and presence of identical T-cell clone in blood and skin) with the aim of developing a prognostic index that would identify advanced-stage patients at risk of progression . Four independent prognostic markers were found for worse survival: stage IV disease, age greater than 60 years, large cell transformation and increased LDH . Combining these four factors in a prognostic index model identified the following three risk groups across stages with significantly different 5-year survival rates: low risk (68%), intermediate risk (44%) and high risk (28%) . This prognostic model may be used to stratify patients with advanced-stage disease who require more aggressive treatments .","Mycosis fungoides (MF) can be categorized according to nine stages, from IA to IVB. Stages IA-IIA are considered early-stage disease and have a good prognosis, while stages IIB-IVB are advanced stage disease and progress rapidly. Early-stage lesions of the skin include patches and plaques. Advanced-stage skin lesions include tumors and erythroderma. Some patients with early-stage disease will have near-normal life expectancy, while advanced-stage survival is 1-4 years. Poor prognostic indicators for survival in MF include increasing age, raised lactate dehydrogenase, lymph node involvement and large cell transformation in the skin."
9781908541703,ch_6,"The dogma of the second half of the 20th century, which maintained that local control of breast cancer has no effect on long-term survival, has been overturned as the results of randomized trials have matured . Local treatment for breast cancer consists of surgery and radiotherapy, which aim to remove the cancer, stop its spread and reduce the likelihood of local recurrence within the breast, chest wall or axillary nodes . Two trials - Endocrine +/- Surgical Therapy for Elderly women with Mammary cancer (ESTEeM) and Primary Aromatase INhibitor (and other aLternatives) as Effective aS Surgery (PAINLESS) - have also been attempting to answer this question, but participation has been poor, mainly because it appears that patients and their doctors usually favor one side or the other in an individual case, losing the equipoise necessary for randomization . Discussion about the higher risk of locoregional recurrence with breast-conserving surgery after neoadjuvant versus adjuvant chemotherapy should be included in the informed consent process, id est that there is about 3% absolute increased risk of local recurrence, with a 6% increased chance of avoiding a mastectomy . The latest overview has shown that breast conservation with adjuvant radiotherapy has a slightly higher risk of local recurrence than mastectomy, but does not jeopardize overall survival . The 5-year results of the randomized TARGIT-A trial have shown that TARGIT performed during lumpectomy within a risk-adapted strategy results in local recurrence similar to several weeks of whole breast radiotherapy . There is no good evidence to support the use of oncoplastic procedures during cancer treatment: patient satisfaction appears to be similar with both simple lumpectomy and mastopexy, the risks of inflicting such additional surgical trauma have not been quantified, and the oncologic safety has not been established in any randomized trial . It is the patient's short-term and long-term satisfaction with the overall treatment, as well as the objective cancer control outcome, that should be a measure of quality of care, rather than the proportion of breast-conserving operations performed . The indications for axillary surgery and the extent to which it should be carried out in women with operable breast cancer remain controversial; the dogma of axillary clearance is now being replaced by a dogma for sentinel node biopsy . Many centers around the world are therefore adapting to no further surgery in patients similar to the Z-11 trial cohort (cT1-2N0 disease, <= 2 positive sentinel lymph nodes, treated by breast conservation with whole breast radiation therapy) . An important exploratory outcome of the TARGIT-A trial, in which 90% of cases had undergone sentinel node biopsy, was that the omission of whole breast radiotherapy (id est patients treated with only targeted intraoperative radiotherapy) did not increase axillary recurrence . Radiotherapy is considered mandatory for most patients undergoing conservative surgery, and is considered appropriate for women at high risk of recurrence after mastectomy with . Furthermore, the omission of whole breast radiotherapy did not increase axillary recurrence in this trial in which over 90% of cases had undergone sentinel node biopsy .","Mastectomy and lumpectomy/wide local excision plus radiation are therapeutically equivalent for most women. Given adequate information, women can choose equally between mastectomy and breast conservation approaches. Breast reconstruction is viable and can be offered as an immediate or a delayed procedure. In the future, selected patients may be able to avoid the 3-6 weeks of conventional postoperative radiotherapy by receiving a single dose of intraoperative radiotherapy during lumpectomy."
9781908541727,ch02,"Red eye is one of the most common eye symptoms your patients will complain of . Many diseases can result in a red eye, ranging from harmless but irritating complaints such as conjunctivitis, which you can treat yourself, to severe sight-threatening diseases such as acute glaucoma, which can be permanently blinding if you don't immediately refer the patient for emergency treatment . The underlying cause of a 'bad' red eye, such as acute glaucoma or iritis, can only be diagnosed by a careful slit-lamp examination and measurement of intraocular pressure . There will be numerous occasions when you are challenged with a decision to treat a patient's eye condition with medication or to refer to an ophthalmologist . Antibiotic eye drops should only be prescribed for bacterial conjunctivitis, which presents as . Antibiotics will never help one red eye, as the diagnosis is either something serious (a 'bad' red eye), which should lead to immediate patient referral, or viral conjunctivitis, which will resolve spontaneously and is not helped by antibiotics . Patients are usually young or middle-aged adults who present with one or more of: blurred vision (although vision can be normal early on), red eye (also mild in early cases), eye pain and photophobia . Symptoms include eye ache or pain (which can be severe, can cause nausea or vomiting, and can be mistaken for migraine) and blurred vision, sometimes with haloes around lights . Do not confuse this condition with the more common chronic glaucoma, in which there is no eye redness or pain, the patient is almost always asymptomatic and eye pressure is usually below 30 mmHg (see Chapter 3) . There is usually eye pain or foreign body sensation; however, in herpetic dendritic ulcers the eye becomes numb (Figure 2.3), so even a large ulcer may not cause discomfort . Red eye, mildly or severely blurred vision, and photophobia are common . Endophthalmitis is a severe infection of the intraocular contents, which usually occurs within days or weeks of eye surgery . The infection causes blurred vision (sometimes with floaters), pain and photophobia, and there are signs of iritis (with or without hypopyon) and inflammation of the vitreous cavity (Figure 2.6) . Diseases that present as 'good' red eye . However, 'bad' red-eye diseases sometimes present like this early on, so it is important to follow these patients and refer them immediately if their condition persists or deteriorates . The eyes are red, gritty and sticky, with a pus-like discharge (Figure 2.7) . Patients are often very alarmed by the condition, which presents as a large area of bright red blood between the conjunctiva and the underlying sclera (Figure 2.10) . No treatment is necessary, but you will need to warn the patient that the condition could take weeks to resolve fully . Episcleritis (Figure 2.11) presents as a red eye (usually unilateral) with mild irritation, but without the pain associated with scleritis . The eyes often look completely normal or are mildly red . Patients with blepharitis also often have dry eyes, so prescribe lubricating eye drops as well .","If a patient presents with a red eye of unknown cause, with one or more of the 'five Ps' (see page 22 ), they have a 'bad' red eye. Refer all patients with 'bad' red eye immediately and urgently - emergency treatment can often save the patient's sight. Do not prescribe any treatment for a 'bad' red eye. Underlying causes of 'bad' red eye include acute glaucoma, iritis, infective corneal ulcer, scleritis and endophthalmitis. If a patient presents with one or two red eyes, but without pain, photophobia or blurred vision, and the eyes are otherwise normal on examination, they have 'good' red eye/s. You can treat these patients yourself; however, they should be referred if they do not begin to improve within 2 weeks, or if their condition worsens. Underlying causes of 'good' red eye/s include bacterial, viral and allergic conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, episcleritis, dry eyes and blepharitis. The only eye drops you should prescribe without an ophthalmologist's opinion are artificial tears, antibiotics (for bacterial conjunctivitis) or mast-cell inhibitors (for allergic conjunctivitis). Do not prescribe steroid eye drops without advice from an ophthalmologist, as they can exacerbate infections, and cause cataracts and glaucoma."
9781910797273,chp6,"Monoclonal antibody therapies that target the CD20 cell surface molecule include rituximab (chimeric), ocrelizumab (humanized) and ofatumumab (human) . Rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have dramatically suppressed MRI activity in Phase II and III (ocrelizumab) studies compared with placebo . Three Phase III trials of ocrelizumab (Opera I and II and Oratorio) are complete and have confirmed its high efficacy in relapsing MS and new-found efficacy in primary progressive MS . Despite promising results in Phase II trials in patients with relapsing remitting MS, a Phase II/III trial of rituximab in 439 people with primary progressive MS did not show efficacy . A larger Phase III trial (DECIDE) has been completed in which daclizumab again demonstrated significant reduction of disease activity in relapsing remitting MS compared with interferon beta (IFNbeta)-1a: a 45% reduction in annualized relapse rate compared with the comparator was reported in more than 1800 patients . Following successful preclinical studies in animal models of neuroinflammation, it has been studied in two Phase III trials, where it exerted a modest (23%) non-significant reduction in annualized relapse rate, but a significant improvement in the progression of disability and whole brain volume loss compared with placebo . The apparent disjunct between an effect on relapses and disability progression/brain volume loss suggests that laquinimod may have a unique mechanism of action, possibly mediated through a direct effect on innate immune cells in the CNS . Additional Phase III trials are under way to establish the efficacy of laquinimod and define a potential place for this agent in MS treatment . However, both conventional (hematopoietic) and novel stem cell approaches (Table 6.1) offer potential new therapeutic avenues for MS, especially in patients whose disease is refractory to current disease-modifying treatments . The Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) study has shown the highest rate of NEDA (no evidence of disease activity) - 76% - in any trial to date, opening up the possibilities of changing the clinical course of MS . In Phase III randomized controlled trials of AHSCT, early studies in MS indicate a reduction in relapse rate of more than 90% compared with pretreatment levels of disease activity . International multicenter clinical trials are ongoing, which should help to define a population of patients in whom the risk-benefit analysis weighs in favor of this treatment approach . Initiated in 2013, the first multinational Phase II trial of anti-LINGO-1 antibodies in patients with acute optic neuritis has shown an effect on promoting nerve repair following optic neuritis . Ultimately, therapies that successfully promote remyelination and repair may be applicable across the spectrum of MS subtypes, including progressive forms of the disease . Mastinib has completed a positive Phase IIb study in patients with primary and secondary progressive MS, the results of which are reported to include improvement in the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (see pages 54 -) . A Phase III trial in this population is now in progress, and it may prove to be an oral treatment option for this more rare type of MS . Multiple S1P receptor inhibitors are in Phase III development .","A greater understanding of MS pathogenesis, from genetic susceptibilities and mechanisms of immune-mediated tissue injury through to the molecular basis of impaired tissue repair, has facilitated the development of new treatments for the disease. The spectrum of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) available to the MS clinician is expected to significantly expand over the next 5-10 years. Therapies being investigated include novel small-molecule immunomodulators, targeted immune-directed monoclonal antibodies, hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem-cell therapies, re-engineering of previous MS medications and molecules that promote remyelination and repair. Treatments such as autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant may be appropriate for the treatment of patients with highly active relapsing disease that has not responded to other DMTs, or as an inducing agent to 'reset' the course of MS. Laquinimod may have a novel mechanism of action that targets innate immune cells; it appears to affect disability progression and brain volume loss more than relapse rate. Anti-LINGO antibody is the first remyelination-promoting therapy to reach Phase II clinical trials in optic neuritis. Treatments that overcome molecular obstacles to remyelination may complement immune-directed therapies for MS in the future. Progressive MS may soon have a number of therapeutic options; the first is likely to be ocrelizumab. Ocrelizumab may soon receive FDA approval as the first DMT for progressive MS."
9781912776207,ch8,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a high-throughput method for detecting aberrations in DNA sequences: it can be used to interrogate a panel of specific genes (targeted), all coding regions of the genome (whole-exome sequencing; WES) or the entire genome (whole-genome sequencing; WGS) . NGS research studies have identified distinct mutational signatures in AITL and Tfh-related lymphomas, and recurrent mutations in other PTCL subtypes (see Chapter 2) . However, most studies have used targeted NGS or WES, providing only a limited view of the PTCL genome . Increasingly affordable sequencing platforms and improved bioinformatic pipelines will allow more PTCL cases to be interrogated by WGS, which should provide new mechanistic insights into the disease . The integration of sequencing data with multiomic analysis is likely to be critical in identifying vulnerabilities for drug targeting . Such analysis will be particularly relevant for PTCL cases in which current sequencing strategies do not detect a recurrent mutation . Some subtypes of PTCL, particularly AITL, are characterized by a heavy stromal infiltrate with low tumor burden, rendering bulk sequencing relatively insensitive . Moreover, studies in other cancers have demonstrated significant intratumor heterogeneity, suggesting that single-site biopsies may fail to capture the global tumor mutational composition, representing a major barrier to genomic-driven treatment strategies . A potential solution to many of the challenges of tissue-based molecular studies is to use peripheral blood as a source of tumor DNA . Bulk analysis generates an average profile of the whole cell population, including malignant and non-malignant cells, which does not adequately capture the complexity of a tumor and risks missing treatment-resistant subclones that will ultimately germinate relapse . However, technological developments enabling single cell analysis are allowing researchers to deconvolute bulk tumors and analyze cancers with greater resolution and accuracy (Figure 8.1) . Single cell RNA and DNA sequencing can determine cancer evolution, provide insight into tumor heterogeneity and segregate and characterize stromal cells . Given that bulk sequencing of PTCL cases to date has been relatively insensitive, single cell analysis is likely to significantly advance our understanding of PTCL biology . Recent initiatives generating patient-derived xenograft PTCL models may facilitate discoveries into PTCL biology and the development of novel treatment strategies . A plethora of new drugs are being developed, including monoclonal antibodies against T-cell receptors, cytokines, and chemokines, small molecular inhibitors that target key T-cell pathways, and agents that reverse epigenetic dysregulation . Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy represents a novel treatment strategy that may prove transformative across PTCL subtypes, as in other hematologic malignancies . Peripheral blood T cells apheresed from patients are engineered to express a modified antigen receptor that recognizes a cancer target (Figure 8.2) . Up to a third of PTCL-NOS cases have mutations in the histone modifier gene, suggesting that epigenetic targeting may have a role beyond Tfh lymphomas . A recent study has provided further support for two major biological and prognostic subgroups based on cell of origin: PTCL-GATA-3 and PTCL-TBX21 (see page 21) . This insight is likely to precipitate further research and identify new drug targets .","Next-generation sequencing has identified distinct DNA mutations in AITL and Tfh-related lymphomas, and recurrent mutations in other PTCL subtypes. Whole-genome studies should provide further insight across all PTCL subtypes. The integration of gene sequencing and multiomic analysis should help to identify vulnerabilities beyond aberrations of genetic sequences for drug targeting. The use of needle biopsies in patients with PTCL yield limits samples for molecular studies. However, circulating tumor DNA from peripheral blood may be an alternative. Patient-derived xenograft PTCL models may facilitate the development of new treatments and increase our understanding of PTCL biology. Given the high rates of chemoresistance and poor clinical outcomes for most patients with PTCL, novel precision medicine strategies are needed. A plethora of new drugs is in development, including monoclonal antibodies against T-cell receptors, cytokines and chemokines, small-molecule inhibitors, and agents that reverse epigenetic dysregulation."
9781910797587,chp07,"Several studies suggest that patient education is a valuable adjunctive therapy in OA, although by itself the effects on pain are relatively small; effects on other important drivers of quality of life such as self-efficacy (the belief that one has the ability to successfully perform a specific behavior to achieve an outcome) may be more substantial . An understanding of appropriate activity and rest cycles may improve adherence to exercise programs, while dietary modifications can encourage weight loss, contributing to the overall success of a program . The benefits of exercise may be mediated through different routes, including increased strength and endurance, weight reduction, more accurate proprioception and joint position sense, improvement in comorbidities and reduction in anxiety or depression . Several evidence-based physical activity programs are available, such as Walk With Ease, Active Living Every Day, People with Arthritis Can Exercise, and EnhanceFitness, among others (see Useful resources) . A range of effective exercises is available to help reduce OA knee symptoms, including both strengthening exercises and aerobic walking . However, not uncommonly, a patient may not be able to do this straight-leg raise off the bed, in which case it may be useful to start with an 'inner-range' quadriceps exercise using a rolled-up towel placed directly under the affected knee . In individuals with anatomic deformity (exempli gratia knee malalignment), it is wise to initiate strengthening/resistance exercise programs with training by a physical therapist . Although there appears to be great face validity in the concept of reducing mechanical force through a large joint by weight reduction, only a few randomized trials have examined the efficacy of this therapy (see Key references, page 81) . Recent work suggests that the combination of dietary weight loss and an exercise class can result in significant long-term reduction of pain and improvement in physical function in patients who are overweight . This finding is probably not surprising given that dietary change alone is often not sufficient to produce effective weight loss; the major problem faced by people with OA is trying to find an exercise program that is suitable when they already have one or more painful joints . Other work suggests that barefoot mechanics (achieved through barefoot or thin-soled walking shoes) may improve joint loads in OA while thick, 'supportive' shoes may actually increase such loads, although the effects on OA symptoms at the knee or the foot have not been well investigated . A recent Cochrane review supports this view, concluding that there is inconclusive evidence for the benefits of bracing for pain, stiffness, function and quality of life in the treatment of patients with medial knee OA . A recent Cochrane review concluded that moderate-quality evidence shows lack of effect on improvement in pain, stiffness and function between patients treated with a laterally wedged insole and those treated with a neutral insole . It has been suggested, on the basis of conventional radiographic studies, that both of these oral agents act as structure-modifying drugs in people with OA of the knee, reducing the rate of cartilage loss .","Education, self-management and exercise are important components of treatment. Muscle strengthening if weak and then aerobic exercises are the key to good management. Use of proper footwear, and weight reduction in overweight individuals, will reduce biomechanical loading of joints and improve symptoms. Use of aids such as a walking stick or devices to aid everyday activities (exempli gratia for opening jars) can also help symptoms and improve participation. The effects of many non-pharmacological therapies are difficult to discern because of differences in study designs and heterogeneous outcomes."

None of the symptoms or signs of orbital cellulitis already described are present, and although there is localized eyelid redness and swelling (Figure 9.2) the patient is otherwise well and the eye looks normal and moves with ease on lifting the lid . Non-febrile adults who are otherwise well can usually be safely treated with oral antibiotics by their primary care physician, unless the infection worsens or persists . Lid retraction, in which the upper eyelid is too high, occurs most commonly as a result of thyroid eye disease (see Chapter 7) . Lid retraction gives a 'staring' appearance to the affected eye/s, and is usually more of a cosmetic embarrassment than a dangerous problem . Ptosis, in which the upper eyelid is too low ('drooping' upper lid; Figure 9.3), has a number of serious causes, including myasthenia, Horner's syndrome and third nerve palsy . Ectropion, in which the lower eyelid is turned out, is most commonly due to age-related degeneration and stretching of the eyelid tissues (Figure 9.4); however, rarely, the condition can be due to seventh nerve palsy or scarring . Entropion, in which the lower eyelid is turned in, is also usually due to age-related changes in the lid (Figure 9.5) . Patients with entropion should be referred urgently if a corneal abrasion or ulcer is present; otherwise prompt referral for corrective surgery is appropriate . Seventh nerve palsy, whether idiopathic or of known cause (tumor, infection, inflammation, traumatic, postsurgical), can result in decreased orbicularis muscle function and poor eyelid closure (Figure 9.6) . Patients with seventh nerve palsy need to be seen urgently by an ophthalmologist (not referred routinely), as all patients with poor lid closure are at high risk of developing an exposure corneal ulcer . Any patient can also develop involvement of the eyeball itself, with corneal ulcers, iritis and optic nerve or orbital complications, and therefore all need to be seen by an ophthalmologist . It usually presents as a chronic, painless, non-tender nodule deep in the eyelid tissue (Figure 9.8) . Occasionally a small lid lesion may progress to an eyelid abscess, which is a tense, tender cystic swelling, often with surrounding preseptal cellulitis . Dacryocystitis is not really an eyelid lump, but is discussed here because it presents as a mass close to the lower lid . The patient develops a tense, red, often painful swelling just inferior to the medial end of the lower eyelid (Figure 9.10) .

In all of these situations, syncope is usually of considerable concern to the patient and may result in sequelae such as injury, restriction of driving, or even death . Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness), and presyncope is defined as a sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness but do not actually do so) . Patients often use the term 'dizzy spell', which covers a multitude of etiologies, including vertigo and postural symptoms; a detailed history of what the patient actually feels is mandatory . Features that may help to clarify if blackout has a cardiac cause are detailed in Table 3.1 . Tonic-clonic seizure, although uncommon, can occur because of cerebral anoxia and does not exclude a cardiac cause . Recurrent presyncope (the sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness) is common and may culminate in syncope over time . Presyncope occurs commonly in situations where the native cardiac pacemaker is impaired but not for long enough to produce syncope (exempli gratia sick sinus syndrome or carotid sinus hypersensitivity) . Syncope in patients with known structural heart disease, particularly impaired left ventricular (LV) function, carries a significantly worse prognosis with an increased risk of sudden death . Patients with cardiac syncope often do not remember the loss of consciousness and therefore only consider that they have had a fall . The patient, and others present at the time of the syncope, can provide important details about the circumstances of the syncope . whether the patient had any symptoms preceding the syncope, such as palpitations, dizziness, sweating, or an aura . Cardiac monitoring at the time of syncope remains critical to exclude or confirm a cardiac arrhythmia . Thus, the work-up of the patient who has had an episode of syncope is initially directed at determining if there are any cardiac abnormalities . Syncope associated with advanced heart block requires permanent pacing, and remains a worldwide daily presentation in the physician's office or in the emergency room . If the electrocardiogram is normal, but a transient episode of high grade atrioventricular block has been diagnosed on cardiac monitoring, permanent pacing will be planned . In non-arrhythmia causes of syncope, such as aortic stenosis or a rare mitral valve tumor, targeted valvular heart disease treatment will be obtained . For patients with neurological causes of syncope, whether vascular or due to a seizure, the neurologist will plan for appropriate treatment . Nowadays, permanent pacing is performed infrequently but still has a therapeutic role in subsets of patients with syncope . There have been reports of performing cardiac ablation of ganglionated plexuses in these patients to avoid permanent pacing and reduce or eliminate recurrent episodes of syncope by reducing cholinergic tone . . Take a detailed history of the circumstances of the episode from the patient and, if possible, from a witness .","Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness or TLoC). Syncope can be benign, such as vasovagal (neurocardiogenic), although it may still be disabling for some patients with recurrent fainting spells. Syncope can also be serious with a potentially fatal outcome, such as ventricular arrhythmias or heart block. Recurrent presyncope (the sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness) is common and may culminate in syncope over time. Syncope in patients with known structural heart disease, particularly impaired left ventricular function, carries a significantly worse prognosis with an increased risk of sudden death. The differential diagnosis is complicated by the fact that patients with cardiac syncope often do not remember the loss of consciousness and therefore only consider that they have had a fall. Always try to find a witness to the incident. Instances of sudden unheralded blackout without prodromal symptoms and with brief loss of consciousness are almost certainly cardiac in origin. Syncope with or without palpitations requires prompt referral."
9781908541680,ch_7,"Physical activity must be reintroduced to our lives - by scheduled exercise for those who enjoy and can maintain it, or by increasing the amount and quality of activity during the daily routine, or ideally both . Sedentary behavior and obesity are closely linked but are not necessarily concurrent in the same individual and should be considered independent risk factors for disease . Lack of physical activity is a risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus and causes a twofold increase in risk for all-cause mortality, hard on the heels of smoking and hypertension in terms of damage done (Figure 6.1) . Physical activity is an integral and essential part of any long-term weight management program . It is difficult to lose weight by physical activity alone but exercise reduces the adverse effects of overweight and obesity even if weight is not lost (Table 6.1) . Individuals who attempt weight loss by physical activity alone should be congratulated on increased fitness, and should be encouraged to monitor their waist circumference; otherwise they may become frustrated and demoralized by lack of change in weight or body mass index (BMI) . At least 10000 steps per day (as monitored on a pedometer) are recommended for health, and 15000 to lose weight or maintain weight loss . In addition to walking for 45-60 minutes each day, advise the use of light weights and maximum repetition across a range of muscle groups three or four times a week . Because of the dose-response relation between physical activity and health, people who wish to improve their personal fitness further, reduce their risk for chronic diseases and disabilities or prevent unhealthy weight gain may benefit by doing more than the minimum recommended amounts of physical activity . Reducing sedentary behavior and increasing incidental activity . Individuals with sedentary occupations should ensure that periods of sitting are broken at least every 30 minutes by at least standing for an equivalent or even greater period of time and where possible some form of activity for a brief period . It is important to tailor physical activity recommendations to the individual, setting realistic goals . For an obese person with chronic bronchitis, a few steps in the garden every hour may represent a significant increase in activity; a patient with asthma may need to be advised to use their salbutamol inhaler before exercising; a slow stroll on even ground may be appropriate for someone with severe vascular disease; advice to stand up while talking on the phone may be helpful for someone with severe physical limitations . The US Surgeon General's report recommends wheeling oneself in a wheelchair for 40 minutes as being a reasonable level of activity for health benefits, whereas a patient with lower-limb orthopedic problems may be advised to perform low-impact activities, or even arm exercises alone . Gortmaker calculated that the risk of overweight is increased 4.6 times in children who watch more than 5 hours of television per day .","Physical activity is a key component of weight management and is important for maintaining weight lost by any method of treatment. Physical activity is beneficial regardless of weight loss, as it reduces cardiometabolic risk, insulin resistance and cancer risk. Although the amount of weight loss induced by exercise alone may be disappointing, there are beneficial changes in fat distribution and body composition. An increase in physical activity can be achieved by modifications to the daily routine; multiple short bouts are just as beneficial as the equivalent amount of activity performed in one session. Some aerobic activity that leads to shortness of breath each day provides additional benefit, and some resistance exercise should also be included."
9781910797693,chp7,"The term switching is used in this context to mean changing a patient's treatment at the clinical level, so the decision by the clinician - in discussion with the patient- to prescribe a biosimilar in place of the originator biologic . Switching between different originator brands has already been a feature of medical practice in the case of epoetins and recombinant growth hormone . The demonstration of comparability with the originator biological provides clinicians with the confidence to switch a patient to a biosimilar . In one published study of patients receiving growth hormone, 98 patients from a cohort of 130 were switched from an originator brand to a biosimilar; 15 reported non-serious adverse drug reactions (mainly injection site discomfort) . The term 'interchangeable' has different meanings in Europe and the USA in the context of biosimilars, with the potential to cause confusion . In Europe, 'interchangeable' is a scientific and medical term that means changing one medicine for another that is expected to achieve the same clinical effect in a given clinical setting and in any patient, on the initiative, or with the agreement of, the prescriber . In the USA, by contrast, 'interchangeable' is a strictly legal term for a subclass of biosimilar drugs that have been approved for automatic substitution by a pharmacist without the agreement of a clinician (and included in the FDA 'Purple Book') . Automatic substitution of biologics with biosimilars by pharmacists (see page 65) has been blocked in many markets, even though many have endorsed European biosimilars as 'interchangeable' . Switching from a reference drug to a biosimilar is argued to carry a risk to the patient in that introducing a new version of the drug that may have differences in tertiary structure could affect efficacy or safety, including concerns about immunogenicity . A switch between comparable versions of the same active substance approved in accordance with EU legislation is not expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity and, on the basis of current knowledge, it is considered unlikely - and difficult to substantiate - that two products that are comparable at a population level would have different safety or efficacy in individual patients following a switch . This is because, as the EMA says, a biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the same active substance . However since biosimilars are not yet approved as suitable for automatic substitution at a pharmacy level, using the INN alone for prescribing will be insufficient . In some countries, the prescriber may have to specify that the drug may not be substituted at pharmacy level . In the context of biological/biosimilar drugs, the term substitution similarly refers to the dispensing of a different biosimilar product from the brand prescribed by the clinician . However, NHS England states that it is inappropriate to automatically substitute biologics at pharmacy level (id est to dispense a product other than the one prescribed) . Given that the originator biologic and biosimilar share the same INN, clinicians are advised to use brand names when prescribing biologics/biosimilars, in order to limit the risk of automatic substitution at the pharmacy level .","Patients may be started on a biosimilar or switched from an originator biologic. The decision to prescribe a biosimilar in place of a biologic is a clinical one, and has long been practiced with the epoetins and recombinant growth hormone. The demonstration of compatibility with the originator biological provides clinicians with the confidence to switch to a biosimilar. Switching does not require any dosage modification, although patients may need to be taught how to use a new injection device. The prescription should state the brand name and international non-proprietary name of the biologic or biosimilar, and in some countries the prescriber must indicate that substitution is not permitted. Substitution of a biologic with a biosimilar at pharmacy level is not permitted in the EU. The batch number must also be recorded. Clinicians' concerns that switching risks problems with immunogenicity are unfounded; indeed, numerous medicines agencies have concluded that biosimilars licensed in the EU are interchangeable and that switching would not be expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. Furthermore, microheterogeneity in the originator biologic means that a patient is exposed to slightly different molecules over the course of treatment."
9783318066241,ch7,"IPN was associated with higher morbidity (longer time to oral refeeding, prolonged hospitalization, greater need for intensive care unit admission, and almost all patients with IPN required invasive treatment) and mortality (34% vs 9%) than sterile necrosis . IPN is frequently associated with prolonged and expensive treatments, as reflected indirectly by the difference in duration of hospitalization (median 66 days vs 15 days in sterile necrosis; see Table 7.1) . IPN should be suspected in cases of necrotic collections associated with new-onset SIRS or OF after the first week from disease onset, or if pre-existing SIRS or OF fail to improve after the first week . Gas in peripancreatic collections on imaging (Figure 7.4) strongly suggests IPN, and has been described in 42% of patients undergoing intervention for suspected infection . A definitive diagnosis of IPN requires a positive Gram stain or culture of the necrotic tissue obtained through fine-needle aspiration (FNA), minimally invasive drainage or surgery . Only 1 in 10 patients or fewer with sterile necrotic collections require drainage due to symptoms, compared with almost all patients with IPN (see Table 7.1) . Recent European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines on endoscopic management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis suggest considering an invasive intervention after conservative treatment fails in patients with sterile necrosis and adjacent organ compression or persistent pain late in the course of the disease . The ESGE guidelines recommend against routine percutaneous FNA in patients with suspected IPN, stating that its use should be restricted to cases with a suspicion of infection but with unclear clinical/imaging signs . Percutaneous drainage would be the treatment of choice during the first 4 weeks after disease onset, but should be used only in unstable patients (exempli gratia those with uncontrolled sepsis) . After a small incision in the skin, a laparoscope is used to remove the necrotic tissue along the tract of a previous percutaneous left retroperitoneal drainage . Before 2010, the standard treatment of necrotic collections (all IPNs and those symptomatic collections refractory to conservative treatment) was open necrosectomy . In 2010, the group published a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a step-up approach versus open necrosectomy for patients with IPN . In the trial, 88 patients with IPN were randomized to either the step-up approach or to open necrosectomy . Endoscopic necrosectomy was associated with lower rates of new-onset multiple OF, pancreatic fistula and use of pancreatic enzymes . Finally, in 2018, the TENSION trial compared outcomes in 98 patients with IPN treated by an endoscopic step-up approach (endoscopic drainage followed by endoscopic necrosectomy in cases of no clinical improvement) versus a surgical step-up approach (percutaneous drainage followed by VARD if needed) . Currently, therefore, the endoscopic step-up approach seems to be the first-choice method for drainage . LAMS have a large diameter, allowing the spontaneous passage of necrotic tissue into the stomach, probably reducing the need for endoscopic necrosectomy . Currently, both multiple plastic stents or LAMS (removed before 4 weeks) are options for endoscopic drainage and RCTs have not shown one to be superior to the other in terms of outcomes .","Symptomatic collections can be divided into symptomatic sterile collections and infected collections. Bulky sterile collections may become symptomatic or clinically relevant because of pain and/or compression of adjacent structures. Infected pancreatic/peripancreatic necrosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Sterile symptomatic collections are mostly managed non-invasively. Drainage is indicated in infected collections or in symptomatic sterile collections that persist despite initial conservative treatment. Currently, initial endoscopic drainage (plus/or percutaneous drainage in collections distant from the digestive tract) followed if needed by endoscopic necrosectomy seems the treatment of choice to drain collections. Video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement is a good alternative to endoscopic necrosectomy. Open necrosectomy should be avoided if possible."
9781908541796,chapter2,"These processes are normally carefully controlled by a complex interplay of genes and their protein products but, because of damage to the genetic structure, they are fundamentally disturbed in a cancer cell . This does not mean it is hereditary, but rather is due to the accumulation of a number of acquired genetic changes that cause the transformation of a normal cell into a malignant cell . Various molecular mechanisms are responsible for the alteration of gene expression seen in malignant transformation . It is thought that this leads to loss of a critical gene that would normally result in the death of the cancerous lymphocyte . In numerous lymphoid disorders, a common translocation is one that brings an oncogene into proximity with the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IGH) on chromosome 14 . The purpose of enhancer regions is to drive transcription of the associated gene; in a B cell the immunoglobulin enhancer is very active and the translocation results in overexpression of the oncogene . An example is methylation of cytosine residues in the promoter sites of genes, which silence expression of that gene, resulting in an alteration of gene function with no change in the genetic sequence itself . The B lymphocyte (or B cell), which has surface immunoglobulin as an antigen receptor consisting of two light chains and two heavy chains (Figure 2.1) . Different types of lymphoma are thought to exist as a result of genetic changes in lymphocytes at different stages of their life cycle . The main molecular event during the antigen-independent phase is rearrangement of the heavy- and light-chain genes that code for the immunoglobulin receptor, thereby generating a vast range of B-cell receptors capable of recognizing large numbers of new antigens . Follicular B cells may stay in the spleen or be transported to other secondary lymphoid organs, such as a lymph node, where they undergo antigen-dependent development . Antigen-dependent development takes place within the germinal center of secondary lymphoid organs, which are the sites of interaction between the adaptive immune system and invading microorganisms . Within the germinal center, specialized follicular dendritic cells present the foreign antigen of the invading microorganism to B cells (Figure 2.3); if the B cells recognize the foreign antigen they are rescued from cell death by the intervention of T cells, allowing a population of B cells to survive that are capable of recognizing foreign organisms and producing antibodies that attack them . However, those cells that have a high-affinity immunoglobulin for the encountered antigen become either a memory B cell (which enables the body to recognize the same microorganism more quickly on subsequent exposures) or an antibody-producing plasma cell (see Figure 2.3) . Secondary follicles also have a mantle zone composed of resting B cells that have not yet encountered antigen . It has been suggested that different types of lymphoma arise because cancer-causing events occur in lymphocytes at different stages of their life cycle . If they have entered the antigen-dependent part of the life cycle and are within (or have been through) the germinal center, the immunoglobulin genes will have undergone somatic hypermutation .","Lymphomas are cancers of lymphocytes, the major cellular components of the adaptive immune response. Lymphocytes are formed in an antigen-independent stage in the bone marrow (and thymus for T cells) but need an encounter with antigen in secondary lymphoid tissue to develop further. The different types of lymphoma probably arise from different stages of the lymphocyte life cycle. Lymphomas arise because of several complex genetic changes involving activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes."
9781910797662,ch08,"The first PD-1-targeted immunotherapy to be approved was atezolizumab, based on results from the Phase II IMvigor 210 trial, which showed an overall response rate of 15% and acceptable toxicity . The Keynote-045 Phase III trial demonstrated that pembrolizumab was active in the second-line setting for patients whose cancers had progressed after cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and provided a significant overall survival (OS) benefit compared with standard chemotherapy: 10.3 versus 7.4 months (hazard ratio for death 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.91; p = 0.002) . For example, the IMvigor 211 trial, which compared atezolizumab versus chemotherapy following failure of platinum-based chemotherapy, did not meet its OS primary endpoint, although this was probably because of the way the statistical analysis was planned, and overconfidence in the PD-L1 tissue assay: the outcome was negative for the apparently PD-L1-expressing subset but positive when the entire study population was included . This is changing with the development of immunotherapies and the pressure to be able to identify patients who are likely to benefit from treatment with particular monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer and BRAF mutations in melanoma . It is logical to expect that expression of PD-L1 by tumor, immune or other cells in the tumor deposit would predict response to therapies targeted at the PD-1 axis; however, this has not yet been reliably shown to be the case, mainly because of deficiencies and variability in the available tissue-based assays for PD-L1 . For example, the Phase II IMvigor 210 study of atezolizumab (on which FDA approval was based) reported that 26% of patients who were classified as 'positive' for PD-L1 expression experienced a response, compared with 9.5% of participants classified as 'negative' . The FDA simultaneously approved the Ventana PD-L1 (SP142) assay to detect PD-L1 protein expression levels on patients' tumor-infiltrating immune cells to help physicians determine which patients may benefit most from treatment with atezolizumab . The single-arm Phase I/II Study 1108 of durvalumab, which included 182 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who experienced disease progression following platinum-containing chemotherapy, reported objective response rates (ORR) of 27.4% (95% CI 18.7-37.5) among the 95 patients with high PD-L1 expression, compared with 4.1% (95% CI 0.9-11.5) in the cohort of 73 patients with low or no PD-L1 expression . However, the FDA labels for atezolizumab and durvalumab do not specify a requirement for PD-L1 testing, which is in contrast to other targeted drugs such as the BRAF inhibitors for use in melanoma, or indeed pembrolizumab in the treatment of gastric cancer . Tissue PD-L1 expression has reasonable positive predictive value, in that cancers that are positive for PD-L1 expression are generally more likely to respond to PD-1-targeted therapies . Atezolizumab was approved by the FDA in April 2017 for the first-line treatment of 'cisplatin-ineligible' patients with locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer . The Keynote-052 Phase II trial examined the activity of pembrolizumab as first-line treatment in 'cisplatin-ineligible' patients . The main adverse effects of immunotherapy relate to autoimmunity, that is, unmasking of immune responses against normal tissues .","Five immunotherapies have recently been approved for the second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, and two have also been approved in the first-line setting. There is good evidence that second-line treatment after cisplatin-based chemotherapy is generally well tolerated, efficacious, and can confer a survival advantage. First-line treatment is also efficacious, particularly in patients less likely to tolerate cytotoxic chemotherapy. So far there is no strong evidence that immunotherapies targeted at the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis differ substantially in terms of efficacy or toxicity. A survival benefit has been shown with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy but not atezolizumab (likely a reflection of the study design); however, survival data from the trials of the other immunotherapies are not yet mature. Combination strategies are being explored; these may be more active than monotherapies but are likely to be more toxic and more costly. Current tissue-based programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) assays do not reliably predict response or lack of response to PD-1-targeted therapy. The management of advanced and metastatic bladder cancer will evolve as the results of further trials emerge."
9781908541178,ch_7,"For a few patients with a painful radiculopathy not adequately relieved by RICE treatment, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may provide some measure of pain control . For patients with chronic, intractable, axial low back pain and/or leg pain, spinal cord stimulation using intraspinal canal implantable electrodes can provide pain relief that can be self-administered . The need for a moderate but effective dosage to control pain (rather than eliminate it) must be weighed against the risk of opioid dependency, causing withdrawal symptoms if the drug is abruptly discontinued, and the possibility of addiction . Tramadol, a non-scheduled, centrally acting analgesic for management of moderate to moderately severe pain, in combination with paracetamol, is effective for the treatment of patients with chronic low back pain . To reach the floor, the patient should be taught to first kneel on the stronger leg, using additional support such as a table or chair to maintain balance, while holding a pelvic pinch . Patients should avoid keeping their wallet in a back pocket, which can impose an awkward back straining posture while sitting for long periods of time . Back braces, which require customized fitting, are generally too cumbersome to don and wear for relief of back pain, except for patients with severe scoliotic or kyphotic deformities, or after operative fusions where a brace is needed to help maintain the spinal alignment . In addition to initial medication, and as back pain becomes less severe, local modalities, exempli gratia application of heat and/or cold, massage and stretching exercises, can be very effective in helping to soothe the pain . Cold compresses can very effectively relieve moderate-to-severe low back pain, and can also be soothing after a vigorous exercise or massage . It was not possible to fully control for all confounding factors, and the outcome did not support a benefit for TENS treatment in chronic low back pain . TENS has been shown to help relieve painful radiculopathies, however, and can offer a practical, non-pharmacological, patient-controlled therapeutic option . No long-term advantage, in terms of return to work and other functional or recreational activity, can be attributed to manipulation, and the patient may become dependent on manipulation for relief rather than learning self-administered therapeutic exercises or back-protective ergonomics . Acupuncture is another non-pharmacological and non-surgical therapy that may provide a measure of relief for acute, subacute and chronic low back pain patients, particularly for those who do not tolerate medication . Six treatments over a 2-week period are usually sufficient to determine if acupuncture can provide any pain control for an individual patient . For the patient in pain, those exercises that can offer some relief and progressively restore, or at least maintain, function are therapeutic . For most low back pain patients, they remain a good, basic conditioning exercise program . The patient then uses this posture during daily activities, for pain relief and to avoid twisting and bending stresses to the spine . Back-reconditioning exercises are part of a multidisciplinary treatment program for chronic low back pain .","Pain management during the acute first 4-week phase of low back pain should consist of RICE (rest, ice, corset/brace, exercise) unless 'red flags' are present. No X-ray or laboratory investigation is indicated unless 'red flags' are present. Treatment will depend on assessment of pain severity (severe, moderate, mild, minimal). Multidisciplinary treatment should be strongly considered in chronic pain management. Medications during the acute phase can include paracetamol (acetaminophen), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants. Short-term opioids for severe pain can also be considered. The visual analog scale (VAS) for measuring pain is very helpful. Bed rest is rarely indicated, but restful postures and ergonomic considerations to promote comfortable ambulatory activities should be encouraged. Graduated and progressive home reconditioning along with pain control measures is indicated. Spinal manipulation once or twice weekly for up to 4 weeks may be helpful for acute low back pain. Evidence for the benefits of manipulation for chronic low back pain is lacking. Acupuncture may be helpful. A trial of six to eight treatments should help determine acupuncture efficacy. Corsets are of equivocal benefit for acute pain management and should be limited in their use."
9781912776726,ch6,"Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults but the prognosis with the current standard of care (see Chapter 4) remains poor, and novel therapeutic approaches are needed . Immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors and dendritic cell vaccination, as well as marizomib, a novel, irreversible and brain-penetrant pan-proteasome inhibitor, are also being evaluated in gliomas . Phase I data in 35 patients with non-enhancing glioma (grade II and III tumors) have shown ivosidenib to be well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities . It is currently also in Phase III trials for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma where it has been shown to improve progression-free survival (PFS) (2.7 months) relative to placebo (1.4 months) in previously treated patients with IDH1 -mutant advanced cholangiocarcinoma (hazard ratio [HR] > 0.37 [95% CI 0.25-0.54]; p < 0.001) . While the 6- and 12-month PFS rates with ivosidenib were 32.0% and 21.9%, respectively, none of the patients who received placebo were progression free for 6 months or more at data cut-off . The selective BRAF V600E inhibitor vemurafenib has been investigated in a multicohort study that included 24 patients with glioma, including six with glioblastoma . A recent single-arm Phase II study explored the feasibility, safety and immunobiological effects of nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients undergoing surgery for glioblastoma (salvage surgery for recurrence in 27; primary surgery in three) . No obvious clinical benefit was substantiated following salvage surgery, but two of the three patients treated with nivolumab before and after primary surgery remained alive 28 and 33 months later (median overall survival [OS] is approximately 15 months) . However, a recent Phase III study (CheckMate-498) of nivolumab with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with MGMT -unmethylated glioblastoma failed to meet its primary endpoint of improving OS . Another Phase III study (CheckMate-548) investigating the use of nivolumab in combination with standard of care radiotherapy and temozolomide did not show a statistically significant improvement in OS; data are continuing to mature . In a multi-institution clinical trial, patients with recurrent, surgically resectable glioblastoma were randomized to receive neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab . Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to exert anti-tumor activity, including reducing glioblastoma cell viability . Following its successful assessment in Phase I trials in patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, marizomib is now being investigated in a multicenter randomized controlled open-label Phase III superiority trial . An autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell vaccine is being trialed across 80 centers in four countries in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma . Patients in both arms have continued to receive adjuvant temozolomide, and the vaccine or placebo has been administered by intradermal injection in the arm on days 0, 10 and 20, then months 2, 4, 8 and 12 and every 6 months thereafter (id est six times in year 1 and twice per year thereafter) . Tumor-localized gene therapy is designed to control the production of the cytokine human interleukin-12 (hIL-12), which triggers the activation and expansion of T cells and is being investigated in patients undergoing resection for recurrent high-grade glioma .","Novel therapeutic management approaches for patients with glioblastoma are needed, but the selective targeting of oncogenic mutations that has transformed the therapeutic landscape in other cancers has yet to be exploited in the treatment of glioblastoma. The need to penetrate the blood-brain barrier is a complicating factor. Ivosidenib, a small-molecule IDH inhibitor, vemurafenib, an inhibitor of BRAF V600E, and marizomib, a pan-proteosome inhibitor, are currently in early trials in patients with brain tumors. Dendritic cell immunotherapy is emerging as a promising addition to the multimodal treatment of glioblastoma. The final survival results of a large Phase III trial are awaited. The use of drug-induced interleukin-12 gene therapy is currently being evaluated in patients undergoing resection for recurrent high-grade glioma."
9781908541406,ch_7,"This can be achieved by inhibiting the activity of plasmin by aprotinin, or tPA by tranexamic acid or ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) . Desmopressin was initially developed to treat diabetes insipidus but when administered in larger doses it increases the concentration of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor (F)VIII and is therefore useful for reducing hemorrhage in mild hemophilia, von Willebrand disease and some platelet disorders . Tranexamic acid and EACA inhibit fibrinolysis by binding to the lysine-binding site on plasminogen, thus preventing it from interacting with its substrate, fibrin (Figure 5.1) . In the absence of a structural lesion in the uterus, tranexamic acid may reduce menstrual loss because fibrinolytic activity is high in the endometrium . If these fail, or are contraindicated, oral tranexamic acid, 1 g three times daily, can reduce bleeding by 30-50% if taken during the first few days of menstruation . The stomach lining has a high concentration of fibrinolytic enzymes and there is some evidence that tranexamic acid reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeding . In these circumstances, tranexamic acid inhibits urokinase and can reduce bleeding from the bladder . To avoid this complication, the bladder can be irrigated and then tranexamic acid or EACA instilled to provide local inhibition of fibrinolysis . The Clinical Randomisation of an Antifibrinolytic in Significant Haemorrhage (CRASH)-2 study demonstrated that if tranexamic acid was given to bleeding trauma victims blood loss was reduced and there was a 1.5% reduction in mortality . As a result of this very large study, tranexamic acid should be considered for all major trauma patients . Fibrinolytic inhibitors reduce bleeding and the consequent need for blood transfusion in patients undergoing complicated cardiac surgery . Tranexamic acid or EACA may also be used to help prevent postoperative bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia who require minor surgery . In most patients with congenital (exempli gratia hemophilia) or acquired bleeding disorders, the appropriate way to manage bleeding or potential bleeding (exempli gratia after surgery) is to raise the plasma level of the deficient clotting factor . Tranexamic acid has a well-defined role in patients with bleeding disorders after dental extraction; it should be given orally in a dose of 15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 10 days and can also be used as a mouthwash (50 mg/mL) in the immediate postoperative period . By raising the level of these clotting factors desmopressin is particularly useful for treating patients with mild hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease, especially when therapeutic levels are only required for a short period (Figure 5.2) . Desmopressin is usually given subcutaneously in a dose of 0.3 µg/kg, although it can also be administered intranasally (which is especially useful for patients to use at home for treatment of minor bleeds or menorrhagia) and intravenously . It is important to note that desmopressin also releases tPA; therefore, the concomitant administration of tranexamic acid or EACA is often considered . Desmopressin should not be given to patients with clinical evidence of atherosclerosis because of the risk of thrombosis when raising the VWF/FVIII levels .","Tranexamic acid and ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) are useful for the management of hemorrhage following trauma and surgery in many different clinical settings. Tranexamic acid or EACA should not be given to patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or those who may be bleeding from the upper urinary tract. Desmopressin will often provide effective hemostatic therapy in mild hemophilia A, von Willebrand disease and some platelet disorders. A fibrinolytic inhibitor may be given concomitantly to inhibit the activity of the released tissue plasminogen activator. The antidiuretic effect of desmopressin lasts for 24 hours and can lead to clinically significant water retention and hyponatremia. It should not be given to those with atherosclerosis because of the risk of precipitating a thrombosis. Topical agents provide local hemostasis, but those that contain animal proteins or are prepared from human blood convey risks of antibody formation and infection transmission."
9781910797495,chp10,"It is appropriate to start symptomatic therapy without imaging in adults under 50 years of age who lack so-called 'red flags' - signs or symptoms of systemic disease or progressive neurological dysfunction indicating tumor, abscess, fracture or cauda equina syndrome . A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has found that exercise and physical activity are of moderate utility for the prevention of chronic back pain . Although there is no persuasive evidence that modifying these risk factors relieves pain, most experts who take a comprehensive disease management and rehabilitation approach to back pain advise and prescribe weight reduction to reduce mechanical load on the spine combined with exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) . As with the findings for acute back pain, in which a return to usual activity is the most effective therapy, meta-analyses of RCTs have shown that exercise programs reduce pain and improve function in patients with subacute, chronic or persistent postsurgical low back pain . A meta-analysis of RCTs has indicated that cognitive therapy reduces both pain intensity and behavioral expression of pain in patients with chronic pain (including those with back pain) . Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective for short-term symptomatic relief of acute low back pain, a systematic review found insufficient evidence to support their use for chronic low back pain . A systematic review of RCTs suggests that while antidepressants reduce the severity of chronic back pain, they do not improve functional status . Treatment designed to integrate several modalities that address the biopsychosocial factors perpetuating functional loss in chronic back pain, rather than attempting to find and treat a single cause (id est the 'pain generator'), is more effective for enabling patients disabled by low back pain to return to work and stay at work than are conventional or surgical treatments . Subsequent measures should include treatments aimed at maintaining bone mass to avoid new fractures, lifestyle re-education, physical therapy, physical fitness training, an appropriate course of rehabilitation to rebuild muscle mass and function, neurological and orthopedic evaluation and, for some patients, use of an orthosis . Vertebroplasty has recently been introduced for treatment of patients with osteoporosis who have acute or chronic pain following vertebral fracture . Patients receiving long-term treatment with either NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors should be informed that all drugs in these classes (except for ASA) carry cardiovascular risks with chronic use . Given alone or in combination with NSAIDs or paracetamol, strong opioids are effective for controlling chronic arthritis pain . A systematic review of published RCTs and non-randomized trials has suggested a beneficial effect of educational programs such as relaxation training, biofeedback, problem-solving strategies, social support or stress reduction for patients with osteoarthritis . Meta-analysis of RCTs has confirmed that NSAIDs are effective in decreasing pain and the number of tender joints, and improving function in rheumatoid arthritis . A systematic review of the literature has concluded that patient education is effective in reducing pain and improving function in rheumatoid arthritis . Occupational therapy improves functional ability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, according to the results of a systematic review of RCTs .","When the etiology of low back pain is apparent, it is most often a musculoskeletal abnormality of the lumbar spine; however, low back pain may also be referred from visceral pathology. Chronic low back pain is a complex biopsychosocial process that cannot be explained on purely anatomic, biomechanical, neurophysiological, immunologic, inflammatory or neurochemical grounds. Symptomatic therapy can be initiated without imaging tests in adults under 50 who lack 'red flags' - history of major trauma, cancer, or signs or symptoms of systemic disease, tumor, immunocompromise, fracture, abscess, progressive and severe neurological loss, or cauda equina syndrome. For patients over 50 and those whose findings suggest systemic disease, plain radiography and simple laboratory tests can almost completely rule out underlying systemic disease. CT or MRI should be reserved for patients over 50 and those with 'red flags' (see above). Exercise has moderate utility in the prevention or treatment of chronic back pain. Pregabalin has small to modest analgesic efficacy. Massage, spinal manipulation and acupuncture provide small-to-moderate short-term benefits. There is insufficient evidence to support the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of chronic low back pain, particularly in light of the increased risks for gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiovascular events. Epidural steroid injections produce small-to-moderate short-term pain relief. Antidepressants reduce pain severity but do not improve function. Integrated treatments that address the salient biopsychosocial factors perpetuating disability appear to have the best chance of returning disabled persons to a functional quality of life."
9781908541468,ch_7,"Hypertension is even more common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); by the time patients develop end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), over 80% have elevated blood pressure, and hypertension accounts for approximately 20% of all cases of kidney failure . Hypertension is arbitrarily defined as a pressure of 140/90 mmHg or more (Table 5.1); a new category of risk termed prehypertension was created in the USA in guidelines from the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) . In patients with CKD, treating hypertension is important in slowing disease progression and in reducing cardiovascular risk . Patients with albuminuric CKD (> 500 mg albumin/24 hours) require aggressive management of blood pressure, with a target of less than 130/80 mmHg . Studies such as the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) have shown that achieving optimal blood pressure goals requires multiple drugs, that control of blood pressure using a stepped approach can take up to 2 years and that, in simple essential hypertension, the newer, more expensive drugs do not offer great benefits over thiazide diuretics . Hypertensive emergencies are situations in which an immediate reduction in blood pressure is required in order to prevent or treat acute, progressive, target-organ damage . Overt nephropathy is characterized by albuminuria of more than 300 mg/24 hours or 200 µg/minute; in addition, hypertension and kidney dysfunction, with a progressive decline in kidney function over time, may be present . In patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the onset of microalbuminuria is a major risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and mortality, and is also associated with retinopathy, left ventricular cardiac dysfunction and dyslipidemia, as well as hypertension . In all patients with microalbuminuria, other cardiovascular risk factors should be managed by, for example, lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the use of antihypertensive therapy, cessation of smoking and taking exercise . Diabetic nephropathy in pregnancy can lead to worse hypertension, an increased risk of pre-eclampsia and an accelerated decline in kidney function . If urinalysis is positive for protein (in the absence of infection), it is very likely that the patient has clinical albuminuria (> 300 mg/24 hours), which has important implications in terms of the progression of renal disease and overall cardiovascular risks . Aggressive intervention in patients with either incipient or established nephropathy has been shown unequivocally to prevent progression of renal disease . Overwhelming evidence implicates hypertension as a major risk factor in the progression of diabetic nephropathy . Aggressive management of hypertension reduces the progression of diabetic renal disease . The VIIth report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends a target blood pressure in diabetics with renal disease (who are albuminuric) of 130/80 mmHg or lower . Many studies have shown that in diabetic (and non-diabetic) patients with kidney disease, angiotensin blockade can reduce the level of albuminuria and the rate of progression of renal disease to a greater degree than other antihypertensive agents .","Hypertension is both an important cause and a consequence of renal disease. Blood pressure targets are less than 130/80 mmHg or lower in the presence of albuminuria (> 500 mg/day) and less than 140/90 mmHg in the absence of albuminuria. Pregnant women with significant renal impairment are likely to have hypertension, pre-eclampsia and premature labor. For optimal renal protection in patients with chronic kidney disease, angiotensin blockade with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB is recommended. Medications, particularly antihypertensive agents, require careful review in pregnant women with renal disease. The earliest clinical evidence of nephropathy is microalbuminuria, which can be tested by an increased albumin:creatinine ratio in a spot urine sample (> 2.5 mg/mol in men or 3.5 mg/mol in women). All patients with type 2 diabetes should be screened for incipient or established diabetic nephropathy, as microalbuminuria is present in about 25% of patients at diagnosis. Microalbuminuria is rarely present at diagnosis in type 1 diabetes; these patients should therefore be screened at the onset of puberty or 5 years after diagnosis, then annually. The major risk factor for development of diabetic nephropathy is hyperglycemia. Aggressive intervention in patients with incipient or established nephropathy unequivocally prevents progression of renal disease. Treatment strategies for diabetic nephropathy include aggressive glycemic control, angiotensin blockade, blood pressure control, protein restriction and smoking cessation."
9781910797426,ch02,"Patients typically present with variable symptoms related to the specific disease, ranging from chronic or intermittent abdominal pain (either biliary or pancreatic type), jaundice and/or pruritus due to obstruction of the biliary tract, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, new-onset diabetes, fatigue, back pain and/or weight loss . Multiple tests with variable sensitivity and specificity are used for the differential diagnosis of pancreaticobiliary diseases . As the signs and symptoms of pancreaticobiliary diseases are non-specific, imaging is key to the diagnosis and management of patients . Transabdominal ultrasound is used in patients with obstructive jaundice to show the level of obstruction (dilated intra- and/or extrahepatic bile ducts) and the possible cause; nonetheless, the specificity is quite low for the differential diagnosis of stones in the common bile duct (CBD) compared with cholangiocarcinomas or pancreatic tumors larger than 2 cm . Although the pancreas is more difficult to examine due to its retroperitoneal position and frequent interposition of air or fat, various morphological features can be visualized, including calcifications, pancreatic duct dilation and the presence of pseudocysts or solid tumor masses . Computed tomography and CT cholangiography can be used in patients with intra- or extrahepatic obstruction, although their accuracy in determining the cause of obstruction seems to be lower than for other imaging tests . Multidetector helical CT and MRI are the methods of choice for the initial cross-sectional examination of the pancreas, including the evaluation of acute and chronic pancreatitis and early detection and staging of pancreatic tumors . Multidetector helical CT is widely available and is often used initially in the evaluation of malignant pancreaticobiliary indications; however, for gallstone disease this method is less useful and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is preferred . MRI can be supported with MRCP sequences that allow for high-accuracy examination of the bile ducts and pancreatic duct for diagnosis of stones and tumor masses . EUS can detect CBD or gallbladder stones (microlithiasis) and therefore offers useful information in patients with suspected acute biliary pancreatitis or acute idiopathic pancreatitis . Detection of CBD stones using EUS is high (95%) compared with MRCP, thus avoiding invasive procedures and aiding the selection of patients for therapeutic ERCP . Furthermore, EUS enables early diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and the assessment of patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis by combining the evaluation of parenchymal and ductal criteria such as stones, duct dilation and/or the presence of pseudocysts . EUS has a higher sensitivity than other imaging modalities and facilitates the diagnosis of small pancreatic masses less than 2 cm . In addition, tissue diagnosis by EUS-FNA gives this type of imaging a distinct advantage over other cross-sectional methods . Although the complication rate associated with ERCP and the advantages of EUS and MRCP (see above) have almost completely removed the diagnostic role of ERCP, the method has retained its value in various minimally invasive interventional procedures such as sphincterotomy followed by stone extraction, lithotripsy and/or stent insertion . This makes both diagnosis and therapy of pancreaticobiliary diseases possible in one procedure .","The symptoms and signs of pancreaticobiliary diseases are usually non-specific. Imaging tests with varied diagnostic performance, technical success, complications and cost efficacy are used to confirm the presence, location and possible cause of pancreaticobiliary diseases."
9781910797105,ch03,". The incidence of schizophrenia is the number of new cases, expressed either annually or as lifetime risk . Incidence studies of epidemiological samples show that there are approximately two new cases of ICD schizophrenia, or approximately one new case of DSM schizophrenia, per 10000 population each year . Until relatively recently, it was believed that incidence rates were similar around the globe, based on results from large-scale studies carried out by the World Health Organization . Season of birth has been found to correlate with the development of schizophrenia: a well-replicated finding is that people who develop schizophrenia are about 8% more likely than the general population to have been born in late winter or early spring (January to March in the northern hemisphere; July to September in the southern hemisphere) . In the UK and Europe, rates of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are higher in several ethnic groups, particularly black people from Africa and the Caribbean . Overall, global studies have shown that rates of schizophrenia in all migrant groups are twice those found in native populations . It has long been known that rates of schizophrenia are higher in urban than in rural areas . Early surveys seemed to show that this was due to the drift of people into urban areas after the illness started, rather than to higher rates of new cases in cities . However, large studies have confirmed that new cases arise more commonly in cities, with the rates being proportional to the degree of urbanization . The relative risk for large-city dwellers compared with that for rural residents is only two- to threefold (see Table 5.2, page 44) but, because much of the population lives in cities, the proportion of schizophrenia that can be explained by this factor is about one-third . Being brought up in a city appears to be the critical factor, and the risk increases the more childhood years spent in an urban environment . The factors associated with city life that lead to this higher incidence remain to be clarified . The best-designed outcome studies are those that prospectively follow a cohort of consecutive first-episode patients, ideally from a defined geographic area, for at least 5 years . Clues to long-term outcome can be gleaned from demographic factors and from the pattern of the first episode . Mortality in people with schizophrenia is increased threefold, and life expectancy is reduced by about 15 years, compared with the general population . This effect can be partially attributed to a tenfold increase in suicide rates: young men in the first 3 years of their illness are most at risk . However, much of the increased mortality is due to the deleterious effect of poor diet, obesity, smoking and lack of exercise, all of which are more common among the population with schizophrenia . Longitudinal studies of isolated, subclinical psychotic experiences show incidence and prevalence rates of about 3% and 8%, respectively, which are 10-100 times higher than the rates for full psychotic disorders .","The incidence of new cases of schizophrenia is 1-2 per 10000 population per year. The condition exists in all countries and cultures, but incidence and prevalence rates vary markedly. Rates are higher in ethnic minority groups. Onset is usually in early adult life; 20% will recover completely. Urban environments in childhood appear unexpectedly important in causing schizophrenia. Life expectancy in people with schizophrenia is 15 years less than the general population, mainly because of increased cardiometabolic disease."
9781908541994,ch01,"Acne (acne vulgaris) can affect all age groups, including neonates, infants, prepubescent children, adolescents and mature adults . However, the disease is most prevalent and most severe in adolescents; it is present to some degree in 85% of all teenagers . The earlier onset of acne mirrors an earlier average age of puberty, but the reasons for persistent acne are not clear . Descriptive terms used for acne in pre-adolescent children are generally based on age; a recent classification of acne in children based on expert consensus included five subtypes according to age: neonatal, infantile, mid-childhood, pre-adolescent and adolescent . Erythematous papules and pustules are commonly distributed on the cheeks, chin and forehead (Figure 1.2) . Neonatal acne usually settles spontaneously and leaves little in the way of scars . This disorder usually presents in the first 3 weeks of life; the prevalence in newborns, as described in the literature, varies considerably from 10% to 66% . It is characterized by erythematous papular/pustular lesions, especially on the cheeks, but also on the chin, eyelids, neck and upper chest . Comedonal lesions are not usually seen . Another explanation is that NCP relates to an overgrowth of lipophilic yeasts at birth that results in an inflammatory reaction leading to monomorphic papules and pustules in predisposed neonates with more sebum production . NCP does not normally require treatment as it is a self-limiting disorder that usually heals without scarring in 1-3 months . Infantile acne is seen more rarely than neonatal acne but is often misdiagnosed . Infantile acne typically presents after 6 months . Most cases resolve by the age of 5 years but occasionally some lesions remain as a continuum until puberty . Patients with infantile acne may develop a resurgence of their acne as teenagers, and parents should be advised accordingly . The central cheeks are frequently affected, and lesions embrace a combination of inflamed papules/pustules with open and closed comedones . The presentation is usually more widespread than neonatal acne . A study of 29 patients with infantile/juvenile acne seen in a specialist center over 25 years demonstrated a median age of onset of 9 months; the disease was mild in 24%, moderate in 62% and severe in 14% . Acne conglobata (see pages 24-5) can present in infants, resulting in severe inflammatory cystic lesions, sinus tract formation and significant scarring . Mid-childhood acne presents between the ages of 1 and 7 years . Prepubertal acne usually presents with comedonal lesions with or without some inflammatory papules . Lesions are frequently located in a mid-facial distribution and may precede any other signs of maturation . Moderate to severe acne was present in 24% of boys and 11% of girls . Acne in patients over 40 years of age may be a product of modern urban lifestyles . The first site to be affected is usually the face, but later the trunk is significantly involved in about 30% of patients . In some patients, acne may be localized to one site such as the chin or forehead, or upper part of the back or chest; in others, all sites are equally affected .","Acne (acne vulgaris) typically occurs around adolescence. Acne can present in the neonate, and may persist beyond adolescence in susceptible individuals. Patients with infantile acne may experience resurgence at puberty. Midfacial comedones in prepubertal acne correlate with relatively worse prognosis. There may be a link between geographic location and the prevalence of acne, with lower prevalence of acne in rural compared with urban populations."
9781908541024,ch_12,"The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial . Most patients with a family history of primary brain tumors have a hereditary disease that is known to be associated with such tumors, such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, familial polyposis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome . However, some patients do not have any underlying or obvious hereditary disorder that would predispose them to primary brain tumors, but nevertheless give a striking history of these tumors in first-degree relatives . Although it is feasible that germline abnormalities could lead to the development of primary brain tumors in these families, there are a number of unusual demographic features suggesting an environmental rather than genetic explanation for brain tumor clustering . However, brain tumor families who do not have one of the recognized hereditary diseases usually involve parent-child and sibling-sibling cases; it is rare for more than two generations to be involved . It is important for clinicians to enquire about any family history of brain tumors, and to be aware of the major syndromes with neoplastic manifestations in the nervous system, so that these diagnoses are not missed . Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate patient surveillance for another occult brain tumor or associated disease, for screening family members, and for genetic counseling . Most patients presenting with primary brain tumors will, however, be sporadic cases and the etiology will remain unknown . The major neoplastic neurological manifestations of this disorder are optic nerve glioma, astrocytoma and glioblastoma . a first-degree relative with neurofibromatosis type 2, in combination either with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma or with at least two of the following: meningioma, glioma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, posterior subcapsular lens opacity or cerebral calcification, or . The major neoplastic neurological manifestations are schwannoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, ependymoma and glial hamartoma, while the principal non-neoplastic neurological manifestation is cerebral calcifications (Figure 11.2) . Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which there is an increased risk of multiple tumors developing in children and young adults, including breast cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas and primary brain tumors . The incidence of the disorder has not been established, but it is known to be due to a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 on 17p13 . Neoplastic neurological manifestations of the disease are glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, low-grade astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor . Several types of lesion, often cystic in nature, may be mistaken for a primary intracranial tumor and must therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of suggestive MRI abnormalities (Table 11.1) . Dermoid and epidermoid cysts account for about 1% of intracranial tumors and are most often found at the base of the brain, fourth ventricle or spine . Patients who have recurrent aseptic meningitis should therefore be evaluated for a dermoid or epidermoid cyst . Rarely, Rathke cleft cysts cause pituitary dysfunction, headache or visual disturbance; in these cases, surgical resection is appropriate . Brain tumor syndromes and tumor-like cysts .","There are several syndromes associated with an inherited predisposition to a variety of brain tumors. However, the vast majority of brain tumors are not inherited. Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate surveillance of individuals at high risk of developing an occult brain tumor or associated disease and for genetic counseling. Recent advances in the molecular biology of familial brain tumor syndromes have suggested new therapies that have the potential to dramatically change the manifestations of these diseases. Cysts are common imaging findings; location, imaging characteristics and other features may help to establish the most likely diagnosis. Dermoids and epidermoids are benign congenital lesions that typically produce symptoms as they gradually increase in size. Total or subtotal resection is the treatment of choice. Colloid cysts should be resected using modern microneuro-surgical techniques."
9781908541086,ch_4,"Published studies evaluating the incidence of anorexia (id est the number of new cases in a population over a specific period) have produced disparate results because of wide variations in the sampled geographical area, the methods used and the sources of case detection (exempli gratia inpatient or outpatient cases, public health services and/or private doctors, diagnostic criteria, content of medical files) . The highest age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence rate was 8.3 per 100000 person-years in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, using an extensive case-finding approach during the period of 1935-1989 . The UK's Royal College of Psychiatrists states that girls and women are ten times more likely than boys and men to suffer from anorexia . In the Rochester study the overall annual age-adjusted incidence was 14.6 women per 100000 inhabitants . In the same study in Rochester, 69.4 in 100000 15-19 year-old girls had anorexia, which made it the third most frequent disorder among teenage girls in the USA . Time analyses showed that the incidence of anorexia in women decreased from 16.6 per 100000 person-years in 1935-1939 to 7 per 100000 in 1950-1954, but then increased to 26.3 per 100000 in 1980-1984 . The prevalence (total number of cases in a population at a specific point or over a given period) of anorexia within secondary-education establishments has been studied in the USA, Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Australia . Studies of at least 1000 girls and young women (aged 10-23 years), including face-to-face interviews, have shown the overall prevalence of anorexia to range from 0.1% to 0.9% . In a meta-analysis, the 1-year prevalence rate of anorexia in the community was calculated as 0.37% in young females . Thus prevalence and incidence are particularly high among 15-25-year-olds, who constitute approximately 40% of all identified cases (Figure 2.1) . Anorexia has long been considered as a disorder affecting mainly young women from middle to high economic classes in wealthy countries . While the disorder continues to be more prevalent in Western industrialized nations of white ethnicity and in middle- to upper-class women, there is an increasing diversity of those affected in terms of socioeconomic status and ethnicity, including African, Asian and Indian groups . In the USA, significant differences in the prevalence of anorexia were found by race in a geographically and economically diverse community sample of white and black 19-24-year-old women; none of the black women was found to have had anorexia (Figure 2.2) . As with other eating disorders, bulimia has a much higher prevalence in women than in men . The reported lifetime prevalence of bulimia ranges from 1.0% to 2.8% among women, and is about 0.5% among men . Bulimia is more commonly found in Western industrialized nations, specifically in populations that are of middle- and upper-class socioeconomic status . In the US community sample of women aged 19-24 years of age described above, the odds of detecting bulimia in white women were six times that of black women (see Figure 2.2) .","Eating disorders are more common in women than men, but disordered eating is increasingly being seen in male athletes and performers. Both anorexia and bulimia are more prevalent in Western industrialized nations of white ethnicity and in middle- to upper-class women, but the disorders are now affecting more diverse populations in terms of ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Bulimia is more common in adults than teenagers, while anorexia is more common in adolescent girls. Disordered eating is probably more common than classic eating disorders in adolescents and young adults."
9781908541062,ch_6,"The new criteria attempt to ascertain the likelihood of developing persistent damaging joint inflammation that requires therapy in patients with recent-onset synovitis . The most common joints to be affected by RA at presentation are the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP)joints of the hands, and the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints of the feet . This distribution of joint involvement results in early functional impairment and slowed mobility, to which excessive fatigue and malaise may contribute . Objectively, there may be swelling of affected joints, which can be accentuated by inflammation of overlying tendon sheaths, particularly in the hands . The tempo of onset is also variable, ranging from an acute dramatic presentation in up to one-third of cases to the classic insidious clinical picture, where symptoms may have been present for weeks or months before the patient sought medical advice . The course of early disease is also variable, ranging from progressive unremitting symptoms spreading to additional joints to less common 'palindromic' symptoms, which may last from just hours to days before remitting, only to reappear at a later date . Disease of the MTP joints and associated tendons results in splaying and clawing of the toes, followed by subluxation . In the upper limbs, this may be prominent in the hands and forearms, compounded by cervical spine disease and associated radiculopathy or by compression neuropathies . More commonly, synovitis of the apophyseal joints at lower cervical levels leads to subluxation and spinal cord compression . Entrapment neuropathies are also common causes of pain, neurological symptoms and muscle wasting in RA . By far the commonest is carpal tunnel syndrome due to median nerve compression by synovitis at the wrist, which may even be a presenting feature . Most extra-articular features of RA occur in RF-positive individuals with severe active joint disease . Occasionally, however, serious extra-articular involvement or even vasculitis arises in patients whose arthritis appears to have remitted or 'burnt out' . In particular, corneal 'melts' frequently arise in elderly patients with minimal inflammatory joint symptoms . The most common extra-articular manifestation is the rheumatoid nodule . Common sites for nodules are the extensor surface of the forearms and over pressure points of the wrists, hands (see Figure 5.2a,b) and feet . Nodules often improve with effective treatment of RA, but methotrexate may worsen nodulosis in some patients despite improvement in articular disease activity . This requires clinical judgment as well as careful monitoring of liver function tests in patients receiving potentially hepatotoxic therapies, such as methotrexate (see Chapter 8) . Lung involvement is common in RA, with pleural disease being present in up to 50% of postmortem examinations . A more insidious and less inflammatory process occurs at the periphery of the cornea (peripheral ulcerative keratitis), resulting in the condition known as 'corneal melt' (Figure 5.5) . Raynaud's symptoms are common in the general population but have an increased prevalence in patients with RA and other connective tissue diseases . Rheumatoid vasculitis most commonly affects the small arteries, particularly in the hands and feet, leading to nail-fold infarcts of the fingers and toes (Figure 5.6) .",Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a variety of articular and extra-articular manifestations. The RA spectrum ranges from mild easily controlled disease to progressive destructive disease with organ- and life-threatening extra-articular complications. Extra-articular disease activity does not always parallel joint inflammation. Patients require close and regular monitoring by a specialist clinician to treat their joint disease and also to promptly diagnose and manage extra-articular manifestations.
9781910797006,ch04,"A post-bronchodilator FEV :FVC ratio below 0.7 indicates chronic airflow limitation and is a diagnostic criterion for COPD . Patients with COPD typically show a decrease in both the FEV and the FEV :FVC ratio (the latter being a more sensitive measure of early airflow limitation) . For example, the BODE index (Body mass index, Obstruction, Dyspnea, Exercise; Table 4.2) is a better predictor of mortality than any individual variable alone, while the CAT (COPD assessment test) is a unidimensional measure of health status with a focus on symptoms, which has been validated as an index of clinical worsening over time (see pages 47 -) . To avoid the effect of airway collapse in patients with COPD during a forced expiratory maneuver, it is suggested that a relaxed or slow vital capacity (VC) measurement, in which the patient exhales at his/her own pace after maximum inhalation, should be used . The PEF meter measures the maximal flow rate that can be maintained over 10 ms; it is most effective for monitoring changes in airflow in an individual over time, but should not be used in the diagnosis of COPD . to help distinguish those patients with marked reversibility who have underlying asthma (it is the post-bronchodilator lung function that defines the presence and severity of airflow limitation in COPD) . In patients with COPD, bronchodilator reversibility testing or small changes in FEV over time are predictive of disease progression or response to treatment . Expiratory flow rates at 75% or 50% of VC have been used as a measure of airflow limitation, and provide complementary information to that obtained from the usual volume-time plot . Flows at lung volumes below 50% of VC were previously considered to be an indicator of small-airways dysfunction, but probably provide no more clinically useful information than measurement of FEV . In advanced COPD, measurement of arterial blood gases is important to assess the degree of hypoxemia and hypercapnia and, particularly in exacerbations, to define the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO) and the pH . Patients with an FEV of less than 50% of the predicted value, or with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory failure, right heart failure or cor pulmonale, should be assessed with pulse oximetry to determine oxygen saturation . This test is only useful in patients with moderately severe COPD (FEV < 1.5 liters) who would be expected to have an exercise tolerance of less than 600 meters in 6 minutes . Steady-state exercise tests require exercise at a sustainable percentage of maximum capacity for 3-6 minutes while blood gases are measured, enabling calculation of the dead space:tidal volume ratio and the passage through the lungs without oxygenation (shunt) . Measurements of small airway function, such as the nitrogen washout test, helium and air flow-volume loops and frequency dependency of compliance (the dependence of lung compliance on respiratory frequency), have poor reproducibility in patients with COPD . Additional pulmonary function tests, such as inspiratory capacity and lung volumes, are not usually required in routine assessment, but can provide further information .","Spirometry is the most important measurement in COPD and is essential for diagnosis. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are recorded in absolute values (liters) and also as a percentage of the predicted values for the individual depending on age, height, sex and ethnic origin. An FEV over 80% of the predicted value is considered to be normal. This does not exclude the presence of disease. A post-bronchodilator FEV :FVC ratio below 0.7 indicates chronic airflow limitation and is a diagnostic criterion for COPD. A standardized technique must be employed in spirometry assessment. It is critical that the expiratory flow trace reaches a plateau to prove that the patient has reached the FVC. Reversibility testing to bronchodilators is useful in differential diagnosis to distinguish those with marked reversibility indicative of asthma. There is no standard assessment of reversibility; generally, however, an improvement in FEV of both 200 mL and 12% over the baseline is interpreted as a positive result. Peak expiratory flow rate is not the best assessment of airway obstruction in COPD and may underestimate the degree of airway obstruction. Further tests of lung volumes and the diffusing capacity in the lung for carbon monoxide may be helpful in some cases."
9781908541901,ch_4,"Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) occur in a heterogeneous patient population who present with various clinical symptoms ranging from atypical to typical chest discomfort . Outside of clinical trials, the overall mortality rate in the first month in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) or ACS is estimated at 15-30%; most of these deaths occur within 2 hours of the MI . A symptom-oriented physical examination should be performed to identify any consequences of acute ischemia and resultant cardiac dysfunction, and to rule out non-cardiac causes of chest pain such as non-ischemic cardiovascular disorders (exempli gratia pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, pericarditis, valvular heart disease) and pulmonary diseases . In STEMI patients, elevated troponin on admission is associated with worse outcomes, and peak troponin concentrations correlate with infarct size determined by nuclear imaging . High-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) has been associated with the risk of coronary heart disease in a generally healthy population (odds ratio 1.45), and has been independently associated with short- and long-term patient risk in NSTEMI and STEMI . Persistently elevated levels in the days and weeks after an ACS episode may identify patients with a high risk for cardiovascular death or heart failure, even in the setting of a normal ejection fraction . In contrast to conventional cardiac biomarkers that reach their peak levels 14-16 hours after the onset of symptoms, a rapid increase in copeptin levels following ACS may help in faster diagnosis and treatment of ACS patients . However, because these measurements are affected by age, weight, race and various medications, their value as an independent risk marker for ACS patients is limited . In patients with a high probability of ACS (typical symptoms, documented CAD, elevated cardiac biomarker levels, dynamic ECG changes) non-invasive imaging will not offer much incremental clinical information, whereas in patients with a very low probability of ACS further imaging may only increase the chance of false-positive results . In patients with ongoing chest discomfort but non-diagnostic ECG and biomarkers, active ischemia can be identified by resting myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) . Numerous risk stratification algorithms and scores have been developed in patients with ACS, based on the results of large clinical trials and registries, and have been validated independently in large cohort studies . Patients with three or more of the seven variables are considered to be at greater risk of a composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, MI and severe recurrent ischemia, prompting urgent revascularization after 14 days . Ischemic risk scores assist risk stratification at the time of hospital admission, help to identify patients suitable for early invasive management and predict short- and long-term adverse cardiac events . Table 2.7 shows predicted in-hospital and short-term (14-day), as well as long-term (6-month), outcomes in patients with ACS using the TIMI risk score and GRACE . Therefore, proper initial diagnosis and risk stratification are critical to optimize patient outcomes in ACS (Figure 2.2) . Invasive and non-invasive management strategies for ACS reduce the recurrence of ischemic events, but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding . Clinical and therapeutic factors associated with an increased bleeding risk are shown in Table 2.9 .","Clinical recognition of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) requires a careful assessment of the clinical presentation and history, application of appropriate imaging techniques and measurement of biomarkers. A patient's symptom description is a critical diagnostic step, and typical symptoms such as chest heaviness, oppression and retrosternal burning are important angina symptoms. A 12-lead ECG should be performed and reviewed by an experienced clinician in all patients with suspected ACS within 10 minutes of first medical contact (id est on first contact with emergency medical services either outside or in hospital). If the likelihood of ACS is high but the 12-lead ECG is normal, a 17-lead ECG may be performed to reveal 'true posterior' ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Early risk stratification is strongly recommended. Optimal risk stratification requires a multivariable approach. Clinical validated risk-stratification models such as the TIMI or GRACE risk scores are useful for assisting in management strategies and timing of invasive treatment in patients with suspected ACS. Invasive and non-invasive management strategies for ACS reduce the recurrence of ischemic events, but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Major bleeding and the need for transfusion are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality as well as a long-term risk of death or MI; gastrointestinal and femoral access site bleeding are the most frequent bleeding complications."
9781910797907,chp5,"Although complications are more frequent in patients with severe anemia and frequent transfusions, the likelihood of a given complication in an individual patient is not predictable based on hemoglobin and transfusion burden and thus all patients with PK deficiency require regular monitoring (Table 5.2) . The hemolytic anemia due to PK deficiency varies from mild to severe, with hemoglobin levels typically in the range of 6-12 g/dL . In those patients who do not receive transfusions on a regular basis, complete blood counts and a reticulocyte count should be monitored at least annually and with any significant worsening of baseline symptoms . There is no relationship between the measured PK enzyme activity level and the degree of hemolysis; once performed to confirm the diagnosis of PK deficiency, this test does not need repeating over time . Hemolytic episodes or crises develop in the setting of stressors or triggers of hemolysis, which are most often due to infections and, therefore, occur more frequently in childhood . In patients with hemolytic anemia, the degree of indirect hyperbilirubinemia is determined both by the severity of hemolysis and also by modifiers of bilirubin metabolism . Gallstones are a frequent complication in patients of all ages with PK deficiency because of the increased unconjugated bilirubin related to hemolysis . However, transfusion-independent iron loading also occurs in patients with PK deficiency and is under-recognized, occurring at all ages and in patients with both mild and more severe anemia . The association between transfusions and iron loading is similar in PK deficiency to that seen in other transfusion-dependent red cell disorders . Regular ferritin monitoring before transfusions and annual MRI assessment are indicated in patients who receive transfusions, and ongoing chelation therapy is necessary in those who receive regular transfusions . Non-transfusion-related iron loading can occur at all ages and in patients with all hemoglobin levels . Although patients with both PK deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis will have an increased risk of iron loading, ineffective erythropoiesis associated with PK deficiency is likely to be the main contributor to transfusion-independent iron loading in this hemolytic disorder . Because iron loading is common in PK deficiency, all patients, regardless of their transfusion status, should have their iron levels monitored at least annually with ferritin measurement . Non-transfused patients should also have an MRI assessment of hepatic and cardiac iron once a patient reaches an age where this can be done without sedation, particularly in those with ferritin levels greater than 500 ng/mL . Chelation therapy may also be needed intermittently in patients who do not receive transfusions as their MRI assessments are monitored . The risk of osteoporosis is likely to increase with age; however, this has not been well studied in patients with PK deficiency . Similar to other hemolytic disorders, pulmonary hypertension is a complication of PK deficiency . During pregnancy, the degree of hemolysis typically worsens and transfusion needs increase . In newborns and young infants with PK deficiency, hemoglobin levels and reticulocyte counts require frequent monitoring . After birth many newborns with PK deficiency will develop hemolysis with significant hyperbilirubinemia, which is treated with phototherapy and/or simple or exchange transfusions .","The hemolytic anemia associated with pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency can range from mild to severe, with hemoglobin levels typically in the range of 6-12 g/dL. It can be exacerbated by hemolytic episodes and aplastic crises. Gallstones are a common complication of PK deficiency and the risk persists after splenectomy. Cholecystectomy should be considered at the time of splenectomy regardless of the presence of gallstones. Many patients with PK deficiency will have prenatal and neonatal complications including hyperbilirubinemia, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation and perinatal anemia. Transfusion-independent iron loading can occur at any age and with any severity of anemia. Annual monitoring of iron is indicated in all patients with PK deficiency, regardless of transfusion status. Chelation may be intermittently prescribed. Other complications of PK deficiency can include low bone density, extramedullary hematopoiesis, pulmonary hypertension and leg ulcers. In pregnant women with PK deficiency, recommendations for management include close fetal monitoring, consideration of transfusions (because hemolysis is exacerbated) and avoidance of iron-containing supplements."
9781912776153,chp6,"significant comorbidity for which untreated arrhythmias may confer additional risk (exempli gratia development of atrial fibrillation [AF] in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, often leading to pulmonary edema or hemodynamic collapse) . The aim of treatment is to suppress symptoms, restore an acceptable quality of life and, if relevant, reduce the risk of sudden death . In many patients, however, quality of life can be severely adversely affected, requiring medical treatment with beta-blockers, occasionally the use of antiarrhythmic medications, or even consideration of ablation procedures . However, antiarrhythmic drugs have two generic side effects: proarrhythmia and negative inotropism . Where myocardial function is depressed, however, antiarrhythmic therapy can have seriously deleterious effects, such as worsening heart failure, proarrhythmia and increasing mortality risk . The aim of antiarrhythmic drug therapy is to suppress the frequency of paroxysmal arrhythmias . The use of short-acting anesthesia allows cardioversion to be performed in a day-case setting, as patients usually recover rapidly after the procedure . Sinus rhythm can be restored in nearly all patients by DC cardioversion, but the rate of relapse will depend on the underlying arrhythmia . Sinus arrest occurs more frequently in patients who have received multiple antiarrhythmic agents at the time of cardioversion . Radiofrequency ablation (RFA; or catheter ablation) is the treatment of choice for SVT (due to an accessory pathway or to atrioventricular [AV] node re-entrant tachycardia), common counterclockwise atrial flutter, non-ischemic ventricular arrhythmias (especially from the right ventricular outflow tract) and AF . On the right side of the heart, the ablation catheter is readily positioned against the region on the AV ring where the accessory pathway is located . RFA of accessory pathways is the treatment of choice for all patients except for . patients who are reluctant to undergo ablation and prefer the use of an antiarrhythmic agent . accessory pathways that are located near the AV node, such as anteroseptal or para-Hisian accessory pathways, in patients in whom the risk of creating heart block is greater, and in whom a pharmacological approach may be the preferred initial treatment of choice . The VA time suddenly lengthens during successful ablation, indicating that the aberrant pathway has been destroyed (Figure 6.4), or there is no longer VA conduction, as the patient does not have retrograde conduction over the normal AV node . If RFA is performed during SVT, typically the tachycardia suddenly stops and the patient returns to sinus rhythm . Thus, in selected circumstances, such as ablation near the AV node, for certain types of accessory pathway, or during atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia, cryoablation may be a safer procedure than RFA . Although this can be a highly successful treatment for epicardial arrhythmias, it involves small but significant risks . Age per se is not a contraindication to catheter ablation - results are generally similar in patients in their 80s to those in their teens . Caffeine has not been shown to be associated with easier induction of SVT during electrophysiological testing, and has not been demonstrated to be generally contraindicated in patients with cardiac arrhythmias .","Radiofrequency (catheter) ablation can cure many types of arrhythmia. Drug therapy can be useful to suppress symptoms initially, but is not curative. Symptomatic patients should be considered for ablative therapy."
9781910797273,chp3,"By the 1990s the first injectable disease-modifying drugs were in use, and in 2001 criteria for the diagnosis of MS were revolutionized by the incorporation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate dissemination of lesions in space and time . While the majority of individual lesions, particularly within the cerebral hemispheres, are asymptomatic, pathology in 'eloquent' areas such as the optic nerve, spinal cord and brainstem is usually accompanied by a relevant clinical syndrome . However, according to the revised 2010 McDonald criteria, a diagnosis of MS can be made following the very first attack where the initial MRI shows evidence of dissemination in time (both enhancing and non-enhancing lesions) and space . When reviewing a patient with CIS or MS, a detailed neurological history and examination must be taken to search for evidence of new symptoms or signs of CNS demyelination . For example, therapies that reduce the frequency and severity of relapses may not be helpful to people with progressive disease . The progression of disease from relapsing remitting to the secondary progressive stage is usually noted retrospectively, for example when a patient with MS has accumulated disability over 6-12 months without any discrete episodes of relapse . Many texts do not recognize this entity, but in the authors' experience a small number of patients present with gradually progressive disease onto which are 'superimposed' periods of worsening that may be steroid responsive (Figure 3.5) . While a clear history of discrete relapsing remitting symptoms may be lacking in these patients, a proportion may have acute (gadolinium-enhancing) MRI lesions and respond to immunomodulatory therapies . Recently, 'active' (clinical relapses or new/enhancing MRI lesions) and 'inactive' phenotypes of progressive MS have been proposed by an international working group . Although 'eloquent' regions of the CNS, such as the spinal cord, optic nerve and brainstem, are more likely to result in symptoms (Table 3.3), the spectrum of presenting symptoms associated with demyelination is broad . Characteristic abnormalities of visual, somatosensory or brainstem evoked potentials may be helpful in confirming that the lesions are disseminated in space in cases where the clinical findings and MRI are not diagnostic . The nosology, pathogenesis, disease course and appropriate treatment trajectory in patients with clinical and radiological features of NMO, but no detectable AQP-4 antibodies, is currently a matter of intense debate . Systemic autoimmunity, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and Sjögren's disease, may present with subacute myelitis or, less commonly, optic neuritis and should be excluded in all patients by thorough history, examination and appropriate serological testing . The Expanded Disability Status Scale provides an amalgamated score that incorporates ambulatory capacity and neurological testing across seven functional domains - visual (optic), brainstem (cranial nerve function including speech and swallowing), pyramidal (motor function), cerebellar (coordination), sensory (touch and pain), bowel and bladder, and cerebral (cognition and mood) . The rate of lesion growth was three times higher in those who developed secondary progressive MS than in those who remained relapsing remitting (Figure 3.16) .","The clinical presentation of MS depends on the location of inflammatory lesions in the CNS. Pathology in the optic nerve, spinal cord and brainstem can result in a broad range of signs and symptoms. However, the majority of deep white matter lesions in the hemispheres are clinically silent. People with MS do not always present with the first episode of demyelination. It is therefore important to determine whether the patient has experienced a prior neurological disturbance of any sort (exempli gratia mild or temporary visual blurring). Depending on MRI findings, MS can be diagnosed at the first presentation because of demyelination within the CNS; this is termed clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). To diagnose MS, lesions must be shown to be present, separated by space and time. The number of asymptomatic demyelinating lesions on MRI at the time of CIS strongly predicts the likelihood of the patient developing clinically definite MS. The pattern of MS - relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive or progressive relapsing - will guide prognosis and choice of disease-modifying therapy. These definitions are in flux; one study suggested the term 'active' to indicate ongoing inflammation on brain MRI independent of the clinical course. Rarer alternative causes of inflammatory demyelination within the CNS such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) should be considered and excluded in the diagnostic work-up of MS. Red flag features that suggest an alternative diagnosis include involvement of the peripheral nervous system, atypical MRI findings or systemic features of disease. MRI is the most important investigation in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS. MS progression can be measured using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and with MRI."
9781908541666,ch_5,"Type 2 diabetes occurs when insulin secretion is insufficient to meet insulin demand, resulting in hyperglycemia . The genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes is, however, brought out very strongly by the environmental factors of a sedentary lifestyle, consumption of energy-dense foods and overweight or obesity . This indicates that the genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes lies in a defect affecting insulin secretory capacity or the long-term ability to continue increased insulin secretion in the face of high demand or, perhaps, programming for long-term failure . In contrast, a number of different genetic polymorphisms have been described in different populations that explain susceptibility to the commoner forms of type 2 diabetes . The effectiveness of this approach is best demonstrated by the Diabetes Prevention Program, in which increased physical activity and modest weight reduction reduced the conversion of impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes by over 50% at 3 years . Obesity has the strongest impact on promoting all forms of diabetes, including those without a clear genetic susceptibility . In certain ethnic groups, loss of traditional lifestyles and adoption of a western diet have had catastrophic effects on prevalence rates, with the majority of adults now affected by type 2 diabetes . Insulin resistance is considered a central metabolic feature of many cases of type 2 diabetes . In fact, insulin resistance is not present in many people with type 2 diabetes, particularly leaner individuals . Insulin resistance accompanies abdominal obesity and is present in atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease . It accompanies dyslipidemia characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and low-HDL cholesterol, which is often found in type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome . Insulin resistance is considered the link that explains the clustering of abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and dyslipidemia . Insulin resistance refers to the reduced ability of circulating insulin to result in cellular glucose uptake . Overall, such perturbation results in a reduced glucose-uptake response to insulin (insulin resistance) . When the pancreatic beta cells can no longer produce sufficient insulin to overcome insulin resistance, blood glucose levels start to rise . Rarely, genetic mutations within the insulin receptor or its substrate can result in insulin resistance . More frequently, increased circulating fatty acids (from nutrient excess or obesity) can interfere with insulin signaling through a mechanism termed lipotoxicity . These disturbances in inflammation add to the metabolic disturbances in the regulation of insulin signaling and contribute to insulin resistance . Insulin secretion is further hindered by rising glucose levels which directly damage beta cells through a mechanism called glucotoxicity . Lipotoxicity in type 2 diabetes is found in the muscle cells, where glucose is the major substrate . However, it has also been reported in the pancreas, where the effects of excess lipid can contribute to damage to insulin-secreting beta cells . Thus, in the situation of nutrient excess and obesity, where there are excess amounts of circulating fatty acids, lipotoxicity can increase insulin resistance (and the demand for insulin) and diminish the ability to respond by worsening beta cell impairment (see Figure 4.2) .","Type 2 diabetes results from a relative deficiency of insulin, often in the context of insulin resistance. Nutrient excess and obesity contribute to insulin resistance, through mechanisms that include cell signaling defects, lipotoxicity and inflammation. As the pancreatic secretion of insulin starts to fail, glucose levels progressively rise due to dysregulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis."
9781908541277,ch_6,"The diagnosis of epilepsy relies on the correct classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndromes (see Chapter 2), with consequent implications for prognosis and choice of therapy . Epilepsy is not a single disease but an extensive collection of conditions with a wide range of underlying etiologies and pathologies, all sharing the common and fundamental characteristic of recurrent, usually unprovoked, seizures . A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures and must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 3.1) . Furthermore, non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (also called pseudoseizures) are estimated to occur in up to 45% of patients referred to specialist centers with apparently refractory epilepsy . This misidentification of non-epileptic conditions as epilepsy can lead to unnecessary treatments that are potentially harmful, and can delay the start of appropriate therapy . Further challenges of diagnosis and management may arise in patients in whom non-epileptic events coexist with epileptic seizures or develop as a substitute for epileptic seizures once the epilepsy is controlled . Despite advances in investigational technologies, the diagnosis of epilepsy remains essentially clinical, and is based on a detailed description of the events experienced by the patient before, during and after a seizure . Physical examination is often unremarkable, although there may be focal neurological signs that correspond to an underlying structural abnormality in the brain . Investigations aiming to unearth anything that acutely provokes seizures should be guided by the clinical scenario . Routine blood tests should include full blood count and electrolytes, and an electrocardiogram should be performed to detect cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities, particularly prolonged QT syndromes . Electroencephalography can support the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and help with the classification of partial-onset or generalized seizures . Routine EEGs are often insensitive - more than 50% of patients with epilepsy will have a normal trace . Routine EEGs have a limited role in determining whether AED(s) can be safely tapered after a prolonged seizure-free interval . In a patient with suspected non-convulsive status epilepticus (see Chapter 7), an EEG can be diagnostic . This investigation is mandatory as part of the evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and may be the only way to distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic seizures . Its role in the clinical management of epilepsy, particularly in selection of surgical candidacy in the case of drug resistance, is an area of active research . Imaging studies of the brain to look for underlying structural abnormalities are essential for the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of most patients with epilepsy, particularly those presenting with partial-onset seizures . Any patient with refractory epilepsy in whom the initial MRI scan is normal should have a high-resolution scan to exclude hippocampal atrophy and focal cortical dysplasia . Functional imaging can identify focal abnormalities in cerebral physiology even when structural imaging results are normal . Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate increased blood flow in brain regions in association with seizure activity . Functional neuroimaging techniques have a limited role in routine diagnostic evaluation, but are useful adjuncts in the work-up for epilepsy surgery .",Epilepsy has many underlying etiologies. A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures. A witness's account is essential for accurate diagnosis of epilepsy and classification of seizures. Electroencephalography can support diagnosis and help with the classification of seizures and syndromes. Structural brain imaging is essential in the diagnostic work-up for patients with seizures suspected of having a focal onset. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for detecting structural abnormalities in the brain. Functional neuroimaging techniques are mainly used as supplementary investigations in patients being considered for epilepsy surgery.
9781910797310,chp8,"To date, nine randomized phase III trials have established reversible EGFR-TKI (erlotinib and gefitinib) and irreversible EGFR-TKI (afatinib) as standard first-line treatment in patients with NSCLC EGFR mutations . These agents have demonstrated improved response rates (RR) (56-84.6% vs 15-47.3%) and progression-free survival (PFS) (9.2-13.1 vs 4.6-6.9 months) compared with standard first-line platinum two-drug chemotherapy . A randomized phase IIb trial, which compared afatinib with gefitinib, showed a significant prolongation of PFS (11 vs 10.9 months, HR 0·73, 95%CI 0.57-0.95, p =0·0165) and overall RR (70.0% vs 56.0%, p =0.008) in favor of afatinib, independent of EGFR mutation subtype . Osimertinib has reported an RR of 61% and median PFS of 9.6 months in patients with T790M-positive NSCLC with AR to EGFR-TKI, and has been approved by the FDA . The randomized phase III IMPRESS trial suggests that EGFR-TKI should be discontinued in patients with AR when commenced on two-drug second-line chemotherapy based on lack of PFS benefit and probable deleterious effect on OS . It has been shown to improve PFS (7.7 vs 3.0 months) and RR (65% vs 20%) compared with pemetrexed or docetaxel as second-line treatment in ALK + patients . It has also been shown to improve RR (74% vs 54%) and PFS (10.9 vs 7.0 months) compared with first-line platinum-pemetrexed combination chemotherapy in patients with ALK + NSCLC . Clinical data from a phase I/II trial investigating brigatinib (AP26113) in 78 patients with ALK+ NSCLC pretreated with crizotinib, reported a RR of 71%, PFS of 13.4 months and 1-year OS of 100% . Alectinib had a reponse rate of 48% in a phase II trial in patients pretreated with crizotinib, with a median PFS of 8.9 months and clinical activity in patients with brain metastases (BM) . In crizotinib-naive patients, alectinib has demonstrated an RR of 94% and median PFS of 27 months . The ongoing phase III AXEL trial is comparing alectinib with crizotinib in treatment-naive patients . Vemurafenib has demonstrated a response rate of 42% and median PFS of 7.3 months in a cohort of 20 patients with pretreated BRAF V600E NSCLC . In a phase II study, dabrafenib demonstrated activity in patients with pretreated BRAF V600E mutation-positive NSCLC, with a RR of 32% and median PFS of 5.5 months . ROS1 rearrangement occurs in 1-2% of NSCLC tumors; the FISH assay is the gold standard test, with recent reports suggesting IHC as an alternative tool . In a European cohort of ROS1 patients, crizotinib reported an 80% response rate and median PFS of 9.1 months . A small phase II study with cabozantinib reported a 44% response rate and median PFS of 7 months in 16 patients with RET fusions . The oncogenic MET mutation in exon 14 occurs in 4% of lung adenocarcinomas, especially in older women (˜75 years), and it confers clinical sensitivity to MET inhibitors such as crizotinib and cabozantinib . In a European cohort of 101 patients with HER2 exon-20 insertion NSCLC, HER2 therapies achieved a 50.9% RR and median PFS of 4.8 months .",All patients with adenocarcinoma should have mutation testing for EGFR and ALK-MET at diagnosis. EGFR mutations at any stage should have treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor until symptomatic progression. Patients with ALK-MET or ROS1 translocations respond well to crizotinib. Second-generation drugs are becoming available. Other driver mutations and targeted therapies need acceleration into the clinic for patient benefit.
9781910797723,chp2,"Tumor cells can block immune responses in a number of ways . Two principal mechanisms by which these effects are achieved involve the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) immune checkpoints . The PD-1 receptor on the surface of T cells plays an important role in regulating the recruitment and activation of T cells, and overexpression of this receptor's ligand, PD-L1, by cancer cells has been reported in several types of cancer, including melanoma and cancers of the lung, kidney, head and neck, and colon . Binding of this receptor to its ligand, PD-L1, can affect the immune response to cancer cells in two ways . Within the tumor microenvironment, up-regulation of PD-L1 on cancer cells and immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells leads to deactivation of cytotoxic T cells . In both cases, binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 on the surface of T cells results in the development of T-cell tolerance, with reduced T-cell proliferation, decreased cytokine expression and impaired antigen recognition (Figure 2.2) . As described in Chapter 1, activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells requires positive co-regulatory (or co-stimulatory) signals resulting from binding of CD80 (B7-1) and CD28 on APCs and T cells . On the other hand, binding of CD80 (B7-1) on the APC to CTLA-4 on the T cell results in a negative signal, leading to decreased interleukin (IL)-2 production by T cells and impaired T-cell proliferation and survival (Figure 2.3) . Consequently, CTLA-4 is an important immune checkpoint and target for cancer immunotherapy . These differences between the two pathways suggest that combined PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade might have synergistic anti-tumor effects: CTLA-4 blockade allows activation and proliferation of more T-cell populations while reducing T reg -mediated immunosuppression, and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade restores the activity of quiescent T cells (Figure 2.4) . Other inhibitory receptors on T cells, including TIM-3, BTLA, VISTA and LAG-3, could represent additional targets for immunotherapeutics (Figure 2.5) . Tumors are complex structures consisting of multiple cell types that create a constantly evolving immunosuppressive microenvironment (Figure 2.6) . This microenvironment can inhibit immune responses and promote tumor growth through a number of mechanisms (Table 2.2) . In addition to the cancer cells themselves, a number of different cell types may contribute to the tumor microenvironment (see Figure 2.6) . The aim of immuno-oncology therapies is to restore the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells . The response of the immune system to cancer cells is a cyclical process (Figure 2.1) that may in principle be self-perpetuating, leading to a heightened immune response . This causes the release of cancer antigens that bind to dendritic cells or other antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to cytokine secretion by APCs and priming the activation of T cells in lymphoid tissue . In addition to allowing the tumor cell to evade immune attack, these mechanisms may actually facilitate tumor progression . The recognition that the immune system may both suppress and promote tumor growth has led to a shift in attention away from immunosurveillance (with a focus on recognition and elimination of cancer cells) to immunoediting (which encompasses both immunosurveillance and pro-proliferative mechanisms) .","The immune response to the presence of cancer cells is a cyclical process that is potentially self-propagating. However, the existence of numerous negative regulators allows tumor cells to evade the immune system. Tumor immunoediting has three components, known as the 'three Es': elimination, equilibrium and evasion:- during the initial elimination phase, some cancer cells are recognized as altered by the immune system and are destroyed- during the equilibrium phase, some cancer cells persist, but the immune response is sufficient to prevent proliferation- eventually, however, selective pressure leads to a predominance of cells that are able to avoid the immune response - escape. The immune checkpoint molecules PD-1 and CTLA-4 are key factors in the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system. However, there are multiple other potential targets, some of which have inhibitory activity and others agonistic activity in T-cell activation. Solid tumors consist of multiple cell types that together contribute to the development of a microenvironment that favors tumor growth and evasion of the immune system."
9781912776153,chp10,"the specialized conducting tissue is not functioning normally - bundle branch block in which depolarization of the His-Purkinje system is still from the top down but the conduction system is damaged (exempli gratia atrial flutter with bundle branch block will be a wide-complex tachycardia) . due to re-entry from a scar or substrate caused by a previous myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease, occurring most often in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (see Figure 1.11) . Sadly, some patients are occasionally made worse by treating a wide QRS tachycardia as if it were arising in the atria and being conducted with bundle branch block (aberration) . If these agents fail, it is better to resort early to direct-current cardioversion rather than to reach for further antiarrhythmic drugs that may worsen cardiac performance in the long term, either by provoking new arrhythmias (proarrhythmic action) or because of a deleterious effect on myocardial contractility (negative inotropism) (see Chapter 6) . Although ventricular arrhythmias may occur in the context of an acute transient event such as during an acute myocardial infarction, generally whenever VT occurs two problems dominate the overall management of the patient: the arrhythmia may recur and it may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and sudden death . Right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, often exercise-induced, must also be distinguished from arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which is a scar-related, often progressive, condition that may ultimately require an ICD . These VTs have particular characteristic ECG patterns that arise in, or very close to, the AV valves, or to the specialized conducting tissue in the left ventricle (the QRS complexes during the arrhythmia are often not too wide for the latter, and are often mistakenly thought to be SVT with aberrancy) . If patients have a structurally normal heart and the arrhythmia is a 'normal heart VT' they can be treated symptomatically, using medication such as beta-blockers or curative catheter ablation (which has become the treatment of choice for this focal arrhythmia) . If the VT can be sustained, then conventional activation mapping is performed, using the earliest endocardial signal as the point of ablation, generally near the pulmonary valve in the right ventricular outflow tract . Patients with evidence of myocardial scarring or a diffuse electrical abnormality are at significant risk of further episodes and sudden death . Occasionally, patients with these conditions present with VT storms with frequent episodes of polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation that are difficult to manage and may require multiple direct-current shocks . Unlike VTs in the normal heart, where catheter ablation is often curative, the procedure has been traditionally viewed as palliative in patients with structural heart disease, particularly in conditions such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy where there may be significant disease progression with time . However, catheter ablation can be effective at reducing or eliminating ICD shocks in patients with scar-related VT . In these patients, mapping and ablation are usually performed during sinus rhythm in order to avoid the prolonged hypotension usually present during VT, especially with underlying left ventricular dysfunction and general anesthesia .","A wide regular QRS complex indicates ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise. All patients with a wide-complex tachycardia need emergency referral and admission. VT may occur in a structurally normal heart and tends to show characteristic electrocardiogram and clinical features. Catheter ablation is curative for normal heart VT, but palliative for scar-related VT. Wide QRS tachycardia always requires further investigation and referral to an arrhythmia specialist."
9781910797082,ch04,"Successful management of psoriasis in the primary care setting requires clinical experience and ready access to specialist dermatological advice, nursing expertise and, when necessary, hospital-based dermatology treatment centers . According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), most people with psoriasis are managed in primary care, but up to 60% of patients require specialist referral at some point . It is important that physicians discuss the chronic, relapsing, non-contagious, benign nature of psoriasis with patients to reassure them and improve their understanding of the condition . Many patients who present with mild psoriasis do not necessarily want active therapy - a diagnosis and reassurance may be sufficient, particularly given that available treatments do not alter the natural history or activity of the disease . Questionnaires designed to quantify these issues, such as Finlay's Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), can provide a useful insight into a patient's perception of their disease and help to tailor individual therapy (www . Factors in the patient's social history can contribute to disease severity or affect treatment outcome and, although sometimes difficult to change, it is important to recognize such factors in terms of overall disease management . Treatments available for psoriasis include a wide range of topical therapies, phototherapy (including photochemotherapy, see Chapter 6) and a variety of systemic agents, some with potentially significant side effects (see Chapter 7) . Approximately 70% of patients with psoriasis can be managed using topical therapy alone . In practice, this means explaining that treatment will be lengthy and is not curative, and that the psoriasis is likely to relapse if therapy is discontinued . Psoriasis is a chronic disease that requires long-term therapy, which raises the potential problem of cumulative toxicities . Rotational, combination and sequential therapeutic strategies have potential advantages in terms of reduced side effects and increased efficacy, while maintaining longer-term control and reducing the frequency of inevitable relapses . In practice, most rotational and sequential therapy relates to topical treatment . The great benefit of a combined or rotational approach is that longer-term remissions can be achieved than with any individual modality, as well as reductions in individual drug toxicities (exempli gratia hepatotoxicity with methotrexate and nephrotoxicity with ciclosporin [cyclosporine]) . For example, a patient could theoretically be maintained on methotrexate for several years and, as the cumulative dose neared 1.5 g, could then be rotated to another treatment . The rationale for elective combination therapy is that combining drugs (with non-overlapping modes of action and side effects) minimizes the dose of each agent and thus minimizes toxicity . Combination therapy is often required for long-term control of psoriasis, as for rheumatoid disease . The combination of low-dose ciclosporin and methotrexate is approved in the UK and the USA for rheumatoid disease, but has not yet been formally approved for psoriasis . This limits the possibility of a relapse or rebound of disease, which sometimes occurs when a drug is discontinued, and helps to maintain longer-term control and remissions . Using this sequential approach, relatively toxic agents such as methotrexate can be used to achieve improvement quickly when psoriasis flares .","Psoriasis is a chronic disease requiring long-term therapy. Before beginning therapy, the patient should have a realistic expectation of the outcome. All systemic medications used for psoriasis can have limiting side effects and toxicities. Patient assessment should include reference to important comorbidities. Rotational, combination and sequential therapeutic strategies can reduce side effects and increase efficacy, while maintaining longer-term control of the psoriasis and reducing the frequency and severity of inevitable relapses."
9781908541178,ch_4,"The presence of any of the 'red flags' suggesting systemic conditions, detailed in Table 1.1, should be noted at the initial assessment, as they will influence the subsequent management of back pain . More detailed assessments of functional ability and of the patient's perception of the pain and its impact on his/her physical, psychological and socioeconomic functioning can be obtained using any of a large number of questionnaires of varying complexity, including . A variety of tests can be used to categorize and document personality and cognitive behavioral functioning, exempli gratia whether the patient manifests inappropriate symptom amplification or other psychological disorders . Although psychological assessment is carried out as an integral part of the clinical evaluation of patients with chronic low back pain, more detailed assessment may be indicated if an individual is resistant to improvement . It is important that the patient undresses sufficiently to enable adequate examination on both the initial visit and, as appropriate, follow-up visits, so that potentially relevant factors, exempli gratia varicosities and edema, muscle atrophy and scarring (including spinal surgical scars), are not overlooked . The initial examination also provides an opportunity to observe inappropriate findings of exaggerated grunts, inability to straight leg raise while lying supine but with ability to sit up from a lying position, or other features suggesting psychological overlay or malingering . A useful maneuver is to ask the patient to bend forward in the standing position and note the degree of lumbar flexion as the individual reaches for the knees or ground . A sciatic scoliosis may be a pain avoidance positioning, id est when a disc protrusion impacts on a nerve root when the body leans toward it, in which case it is seen typically during flexion and/or side bending (Figure 1.3) . Spinal malalignment can also be the result of postural adaptations made to avoid the discomfort associated with painful lower extremity disorders, exempli gratia arthritis of the hip or knee . Hip arthritis, which mimics L2-L4 radiculopathy, is a commonly overlooked diagnosis in patients with low back pain and apparent sciatica, and the FABERE (Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation, Extension) hip motion test (Figure 1.8) should be an essential component of the back examination where this possibility exists . If when asked, or on the pain drawing, the patient indicates the location of pain in the proximal thigh and groin, there is a strong possibility that hip joint disease is the cause . The symptomatic leg is then slowly raised while keeping the knee extended: sciatic pain is provoked at about 30°, id est the angle that moves the nerve root in the spinal canal . An overall lower extremity and trunk strength and balance test can be quickly done, by simply asking the patient to sit and then rise, like with a deep knee bend . With the patient seated or lying down to avoid pain, the examiner can test the muscles by placing a hand over the distal area to be tested, exempli gratia the great toe for the long toe extensor or the metatarsophalangeal joints for the ankle dorsiflexors .","'Red flags' are a set of findings that suggest that back pain is non-mechanical and may be due to fracture, malignancy, infection or systemic inflammatory disease The visual analog scale (VAS) is a simple linear scale to measure pain intensity and response to therapy. The pain drawing provides a simple way for the patient to indicate the region of the pain and often suggest etiology. A classic example involves groin tenderness as a marker of probable hip joint disease rather than a back-referred disorder. Ergonomic factors should be assessed, and this can often be readily done by observing the patient's movement in the clinic and during examination. Palpation of key painful areas of the spine, facet joint areas, iliac crests, buttocks (sciatic outlet - piriformis region) and trochanteric bursae will often indicate the nature of the pain and/or significant areas of referred pain that may respond to different forms of therapy. The patient's gait and body motion can be observed in the clinic to detect sciatic scoliosis; short leg; hip, knee or foot arthritis or weakness; and/or foot drop as markers of relevant pathology."
9781910797853,chp3,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults, with an incidence of 4.2 new cases per 100 000 men and women per year in the USA between 2010 and 2014, and 3100 new cases in the UK in 2014 . Although AML affects all age groups, according to the US-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) the median age of diagnosis is 68 years, with a slight predominance in males . The number of new cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 1.7 per 100 000 men and women per year in the USA between 2010 and 2014, and there were 760 new cases in the UK in 2014 . The number of new cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was 1.8 per 100 000 men and women per year in the USA between 2010 and 2014, and there were 750 new cases in the UK in 2014 . The incidence of CML increases with age (see Figure 3.1), with the median age of diagnosis being 64 years . The number of new cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was 4.7 per 100 000 men and women per year in the USA between 2010 and 2014, and there were 3500 new cases in the UK in 2014 . The incidence of CLL increases with age (see Figure 3.1), and the median age of diagnosis is 70 years . Like most cancers, the main risk factor for AML, CML and CLL is age, and so with an aging population the prevalence of these conditions increases . Despite the presence of certain etiologic factors, the major reason for the development of most leukemias is the accumulation of genetic mutations as a person ages . The presence of pre-existing populations of cells that place individuals at risk for developing leukemia has also long been recognized . Myelodysplasia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic clonal disorders of the bone marrow that results in one or more cytopenias . The risk of developing AML affects the overall survival of patients with MDS . A surprising finding in recent years has been the high prevalence of mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms (exempli gratia recurrent mutations in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1) in otherwise healthy individuals, the frequency of which increases with age . Patients with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) have an increased risk of hematologic malignancies, but it is important to emphasize that the majority of individuals with CHIP do not develop a hematologic disorder . Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of both ALL and AML . However, a subset of patients with TAM subsequently develop AML . The accumulation of other gene mutations, including those that encode the cohesin complex, results in the development of AML (Figure 3.2) . An example of one such group of disorders encompasses patients with mutations in the transcription factor GATA2 gene . In these patients, germline heterozygous mutations in GATA2 result in a predisposition to MDS and AML .","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Age is the main risk factor for AML, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); the prevalence of these leukemias increases with age. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) most commonly affects younger people; over 50% of patients with ALL are under 20 years of age. The main risk factor for AML, CML and CLL is age, with recurrent genetic mutations accumulating over time. Predisposing conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis increase the risk of AML and CLL, respectively. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is present in up to 10% of the population aged over 65. Although this increases the risk of hematologic malignancies, most individuals with CHIP do not develop a hematologic disorder. Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of AML and ALL. The risk is greatest in early childhood, when transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) develops. However, TAM spontaneously remits in most cases; only about 10% of cases, with additional genetic mutations, go on to develop AML. Although most cases of AML are sporadic, arising from the steady accumulation of genetic mutations with age, some individuals have a germline inherited genetic predisposition to the disease. Environmental exposures to chemicals such as benzene, high-dose ionizing radiation and previous chemotherapy increase the risk of leukemia to varying degrees."
9781910797181,ch04,"The irritancy of nicotine and other components of smoke in the airways usually causes coughing and sore throat on initial exposure . For many people this is accompanied by nausea and dizziness caused by the action of nicotine on the central nervous system (CNS) and by the anoxic effect of inhaling carbon monoxide . Adaptation to the acute unpleasant effects of smoking occurs quickly, and within a few weeks or months novice smokers are able to tolerate as much nicotine from each cigarette as habitual smokers . Long-term smoking has disastrous effects on most body systems, resulting in the death of half of smokers who do not manage to stop (Table 4.1); it kills an estimated 6 million people worldwide each year . The average smoker who fails to stop can expect to develop diseases of old age many years earlier than a non-smoker . The average middle-aged smoker's risk of contracting heart disease in a 10-year period is approximately double that of someone who has never smoked . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is, like lung cancer, relatively uncommon in non-smokers in western countries . The only truly effective course of action is to stop smoking, but most patients with COPD, even those with advanced disease, have considerable difficulty with this . This approach, together with a vigorous and intensive smoking cessation program, has been found to be an effective means of encouraging quitting in a substantial number of smokers . Smoking is also linked to gastric ulcers and circulatory diseases, which lead to death in considerable numbers of patients, and to suffering and disability in many more . Many pregnant smokers and even some clinicians fail to appreciate the significance of this low birth weight: it is directly linked to an increased risk of stillbirth and death for the baby during childbirth or soon afterwards . There is also some evidence that low birth weight is linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular and lung disease in the offspring in middle age . Smoking is also an important cause of miscarriage, the risk being several times higher than in non-smokers when other known risk factors are controlled for . Also, there is evidence that smoking (and possibly any form of nicotine use) during pregnancy increases the subsequent risk of sudden infant death syndrome (crib or cot death) . At the doses absorbed by smokers, nicotine is not known to cause major physical illness, except in certain categories of patient, for example those susceptible to Buerger's syndrome, in which circulation to the limbs is lost, and possibly in pregnancy . The temporary mood changes that smokers experience when they stop are often unpleasant and disruptive; they have been compared with the effects of psychiatric disorders . However, there is no clear evidence that stopping smoking places smokers at greater risk of developing depression . The greatest benefit is achieved in those who stop while they are relatively young, and before they develop a smoking-related disease, but all smokers stand to gain by quitting . In fact, a healthy adult who stops smoking before 35 years of age can have a near-normal life expectancy .","Smoking causes substantial mortality and morbidity, killing an estimated 6 million people worldwide each year. The main causes of death from smoking are lung cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Smoking also increases the risk of a wide range of disabling conditions, such as age-related blindness, deafness and dementia. Smoking impairs fertility and increases the risk of fetal and neonatal death. Stopping smoking reduces the risks; a healthy smoker who stops before 35 years of age has a near-normal life expectancy. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and acts, among other things, as a central nervous system stimulant. Nicotine at the level associated with smoking has relatively few adverse health effects and does not cause cancer. Smoking cessation causes temporary withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability, restlessness, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating and increased appetite. Many smokers experience permanent weight gain when they stop smoking."
9781910797495,chp1,"Increased understanding of nociceptive transmission and pain pathophysiology, recognition of heterogeneity among C fibers extending to their production of different molecular transducers, discovery of new receptors such as those for vanilloids or growth factors, and identification of new receptor subtypes have already resulted in preclinical and early clinical testing of novel analgesics . Functional MRI allows real-time clinical observation of the brain's pain excitatory and inhibitory circuitry, which helps us to understand how nociceptive input is processed and translated into pain and suffering . Existing knowledge of temperature and chemical mechanisms includes the key role of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV), acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) and P X receptor sites, which have all become exciting new targets to block nociception at a peripheral level (Figure 1.1) . Peripheral sensitization and heightened afferent activity in pain fibers elicit functional, chemical and anatomic reorganization in spinal cord neurons . These changes lead to long-term central potentiation, a form of pain memory characterized by progressively enhanced and prolonged spinal neuronal responses to afferent impulses . This spatially and temporally exaggerated processing of persistent nociceptive information translates clinically into increased experience of pain - not only response to noxious stimulation in the injured tissue (primary hyperalgesia), but also response in the surrounding uninjured tissue (secondary hyperalgesia), with repetitive stimulation producing progressively greater neuronal responses . Central potentiation is due to the release by spinal afferent nociceptive neurons of excitatory mediators such as substance P and glutamate that bind to neurokinin-1 (NK1) and N -methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptors, respectively, in the dorsal horn . In addition, changes in the chemical environment surrounding the damaged axon trigger ectopic nerve action potentials, which lead to further impulses (Figure 1.4) . In addition to the activation of NMDA receptors, spinal cord hyperexcitability could be produced by upregulation of sodium channels and voltage-sensitive calcium channels in neurons of the dorsal root ganglia . The central hyperexcitable state and enlargement of the area in the periphery where stimulation evokes a neuronal response are sustained by ectopic peripheral nerve activity that causes ongoing release of neurotransmitters in the spinal cord (see Figure 1.3) . Increased glial cell activity normally subsides gradually after injury; its continuation in some patients may be one of the keys to 'what goes wrong in chronic pain' . The death of these neurons could explain the decrease in GABA, an inhibitory transmitter, in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord after nerve damage, as shown by immunoreactivity experiments (Figure 1.9) . Identification of a small family of genes that controls the activation of GCH1 and NO release means that it may be possible to develop a genetic marker, based on DNA testing, to determine which patients are at risk of progressing from acute to persistent pain after injury or surgery . There is strong evidence that learning and memory processes play a key role in determining which patients progress from acute to chronic pain, and continue to experience chronic pain . In patients who have had a spinal cord injury (SCI), the neuroplastic changes are much greater in those who experience pain than in those with no pain .","The nervous system is dynamic and plastic; noxious stimuli trigger biological processes that lead to amplification or inhibition of the noxious signal. Nociceptive input activates descending pathways that inhibit spinal noxious transmission. These descending pathways are potential targets for analgesic drugs. Neuropathic pain is produced by a lesion of the peripheral or central nervous system (CNS). Nerve injury produces hyperexcitability and spontaneous generation of ectopic impulses in axons and neurons. Ectopic peripheral nerve activity contributes to the central hyperexcitable state and enlargement of neuronal receptive fields. After nerve injury there may be a loss of spinal inhibition control resulting from loss of neuronal inhibitory processes and persistence of glia-induced neuronal hypersensitivity. The connectivity of sympathic fibers to injured neurons contributes to the activation of pain by stress. All three of these maladaptions may play a major role in chronic neuropathic pain. Increased understanding of chronic pain pathophysiology is leading to new pharmacological targets for treatment. Increased understanding of the causal pathway from acute to chronic pain (chronification), provides targets for early preventive interventions following onset of pain-causing injury or disease. New imaging (especially of the brain) is increasing knowledge of pathophysiological CNS neuroplasticity changes and showing the effects of biobehavioral training to reverse these changes."
9781910797433,ch02,"Pathophysiology and classification . Traditionally, it was believed that ovarian cancers usually originated in the surface epithelium of the ovaries . Although this theory supports the genesis of low-grade serous carcinoma, recent studies indicate that high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most common histological subtype of ovarian cancer, originates in the fimbria of the fallopian tubes (Figure 2.1) . Precancerous lesions, called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) have been found on the fimbria in 5-10% of women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations undergoing risk-reducing surgery and in up to 60% of unselected women with pelvic HGSC . For this reason, the term 'ovarian cancer' should be considered a collective term that covers all ovarian-fallopial tube and primary peritoneal cancers . Ovarian cancer cells tend to exfoliate into the peritoneum, where circulation of peritoneal fluid distributes them to the peritoneal surfaces and omentum . Indeed, intraperitoneal dissemination is the most characteristic feature of ovarian cancer; malignant cells can implant anywhere in the peritoneal cavity, particularly at sites of stasis within the peritoneal fluid circulation system . The disease can spread via a number of mechanisms, including . local extension . lymphatic invasion . hematogenous dissemination . transdiaphragmatic passage . The World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification of epithelial ovarian cancer is summarized in Figure 2.2 . Epithelial tumors are the most common form of ovarian cancer, and the main focus of this book . The WHO classification for other forms of ovarian cancer are summarized in Table 2.1 and discussed in Chapter 9 . Epithelial tumors include benign, borderline and malignant histologies . Borderline tumors are a separate tumor entity characterized by complex papillary architecture, stratified epithelium with tufting (apparent detachment of cell clusters from their sites of origin), moderate nuclear abnormalities and moderately increased mitotic activity; in contrast to malignant tumors, they do not show stromal invasion . The pathological characteristics of borderline tumors are . total microinvasive area < 10 mm . depth of invasion <= 3 mm . Epithelial cancers account for 80-90% of all malignant ovarian neoplasms,, of which HGSCs account for 70-74%, endometrioid tumors for 7-24% and clear cell carcinomas for 10-26% (Figure 2.3) . Low-grade serous tumors are believed to originate from benign ovarian cysts, and to develop via a borderline epithelial tumor to form an invasive tumor . These are indolent, slow-growing tumors that usually respond poorly to platinum-based chemotherapy . Although they are usually fatal, prolonged survival may be achievable in some patients . High-grade serous tumors are more common than low-grade tumors, and are believed to develop from STICs (see above) . These are aggressive tumors that initially respond well to platinum-based therapy, but typically recur .","Increasing evidence suggests that serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs) in the fallopian tube are the most common precursor lesions of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common type of epithelial ovarian cancer. Intraperitoneal dissemination is the most characteristic feature of ovarian cancer. Borderline ovarian tumors constitute a separate tumor entity and can present with the same histological subgroups as the invasive form of the disease."
9781912776153,chp4,"There are more than 350 000 deaths every year from sudden cardiac arrest in the USA, accounting for more than 50% of all cardiovascular causes of death in the USA, and it is estimated that 6 million die from it annually worldwide . The reasons for this include: more widespread adoption of high-performance cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by emergency medical personnel; increasing the rates of CPR training for local residents; the practice of emergency services personnel giving CPR instructions to bystanders by phone; and increasing public access to automated external defibrillators as a result of their being carried in police and fire service vehicles . As a result, the overall survival rates of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have increased dramatically, particularly in some parts of the world, such as Seattle, where survival rates have increased significantly . SCD usually occurs in individuals with underlying cardiac disease and occurs more frequently with male sex and increasing age . In patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular or myocardial abnormalities, SCD can be the first presentation of the patient . An acute coronary syndrome can lead to ventricular fibrillation (VF) in a patient not previously known to have cardiac disease . Alternatively, a patient who has had coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the past may present years later with a new ischemic event leading to SCD . The major cause of sudden death in advanced countries remains ischemic and hypertensive heart disease . A structural abnormality, usually secondary to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is present in the majority (80%) of younger patients (aged <= 35 years) affected by SCD . Cardiac electrical disorders account for fewer than 10% of cases and include arrhythmogenic disorders such as long QT syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, idiopathic VF and Brugada syndrome . Postmortem examination often reveals no evidence of demonstrable cardiac pathology; the death of the patient is often classified as of unknown etiology . Indeed, sudden death is often the sentinel event, and postmortem examination is required to determine the cause of death . Although this may reveal a non-cardiac cause, such as asthma, epilepsy or pulmonary embolism, SCD is the principal cause of sudden death in young people, and structural cardiovascular abnormalities are often evident on postmortem examination . Not infrequently, there are no causes found either before or after an episode of SCD to explain why the patient collapsed and required resuscitation . These patients (typically males) have characteristic coving of the electrocardiogram in the precordial leads V1-V3 due to an abnormality of repolarization, and episodes of ventricular tachycardia/VF can be exacerbated or provoked by hyperthermia . Genetic testing should include blood samples of family members of patients who have survived an unexplained cardiac arrest . If patients do not survive a cardiac arrest, a molecular postmortem examination, consisting of blood and tissue samples, should be carried out whenever possible . Resuscitation and hospital care after cardiac arrest . Bystanders to patients with SCD can start resuscitation measures, and in some communities new smartphone software alerts individuals who are able to give such help that a cardiac arrest has occurred near their location .","Sudden cardiac death (SCD) represents a significant healthcare problem, accounting for more than 350 000 deaths in the USA alone every year, and an estimated 6 million deaths annually worldwide. SCD is defined according to whether it was witnessed or not. If witnessed, unexpected death must have occurred within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms; if not, unexpected death must have occurred within 24 hours of the patient last being observed without symptoms. SCD usually occurs in individuals with underlying cardiac disease and occurs more frequently with male sex and increasing age. In SCD in those aged under 35 years, approximately 80% have a structural abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, very rarely coronary artery anomalies. Other causes include: metabolic (such as electrolyte abnormalities); drugs and medication; genetic syndromes such as primary electrical disorders or channelopathies. The overall survival rates of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have increased dramatically for reasons including: increasing recognition of the condition; more widespread adoption of high-performance cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by emergency medical personnel; increased rates of CPR training for local residents; emergency services personnel giving CPR instructions to bystanders by phone; and increasing public access to automated external defibrillators as a result of their being carried in police and fire service vehicles."
9781905832729,ch_4,"Urgency incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine accompanied, or immediately preceded, by urgency, and is largely caused by involuntary detrusor contractions (called detrusor overactivity) during bladder filling/storage . Urodynamic stress incontinence is noted during filling cystometry and is defined as the involuntary leakage of urine during increased abdominal pressure, in the absence of a detrusor contraction . In reality, some ISD must exist for SUI to occur and thus sphincteric incontinence in the woman is generally due to a combination of hypermobility (lack of support) and ISD in variable proportions . Pure ISD can exist in women, and it is generally the cause of postprostatectomy sphincter incontinence in men, in whom no counterpart of hypermobility or poor support exists . The pelvic floor muscles support the bladder neck, rectum and vagina (Figure 3.1) . Exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor, and therefore improve support of the bladder neck, were first described by Dr Arnold Kegel in 1948 . Weighted vaginal cones can help women to identify the muscles of the pelvic floor (Figure 3.3) . Duloxetine hydrochloride is a combined serotonin and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitor which is approved in Europe for the treatment of stress incontinence in women . The gold-standard procedure for treating stress incontinence used to be colposuspension (described below), which is major surgery that necessitates a lengthy hospital stay and has a prolonged recovery time . Minimally invasive mid-urethral sling insertion (Figure 3.4) is popular, as the procedure can usually be carried out on a day-case (outpatient) basis, complication rates are low and long-term results are excellent (up to 70-80% cure rate at up to 10 years) . For this reason, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recommended that all slings for the treatment of stress incontinence should be composed of type 1 polypropylene mesh (knitted meshes with a large pore size) . However, it is a more invasive procedure than sling insertion, and is associated with higher rates of enterocele formation and voiding dysfunction in the postoperative period . Bulking agents can be injected under local anesthesia and provide a treatment for women who are unfit to undergo general anesthesia or for whom a sling insertion or colposuspension are not suitable . Success rates are around 25-50% (lower than with mid-urethral slings and colposuspension), and the procedure may need to be repeated . Historically a number of other operations have been used to treat stress incontinence in women . These procedures are rarely performed nowadays because the success rates and complications are worse than with minimally invasive sling insertion and colposuspension . All surgical procedures for stress incontinence carry the risk of voiding problems in the postoperative period . Management of stress/sphincteric incontinence in men . Insertion of an artificial urinary sphincter (Figure 3.6) is a definitive treatment for intractable stress incontinence after prostatectomy, provided that the bladder pressure during filling is normal and that the patient is sufficiently fit to undergo surgery and is able to operate the artificial sphincter .","Stress incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine on exertion. It is far more common in women than in men. Risk factors for stress incontinence in women include pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and obesity. Prostatectomy is the main cause in men. Behavioral modification, including pelvic floor muscle exercises, is effective in women and men when taught correctly, and a number of devices are available to assist with training. The surgical procedure of choice in women is insertion of a retropubic or transobturator tape mid-urethral sling to provide support for the urethra. Other alternatives in women are colposuspension and injection of bulking agents. Options for management in men include injection of bulking agent into the urethral sphincter, insertion of a perineal sling or artificial urinary sphincter."
9781910797433,ch04,"As outlined in Chapter 1, the majority of women with ovarian cancer (> 80%) are not diagnosed until the disease has reached an advanced stage . The initial diagnostic pathway of epithelial ovarian cancer is based on the assessment of symptoms and overall clinical picture, biomarkers (particularly CA125), family history and imaging . Although ovarian cancer has previously been considered a 'silent killer', it is now recognized that a high proportion of women have symptoms before diagnosis . The most common symptoms are vague and non-specific, resembling irritable bowel syndrome, and hence a diagnosis of ovarian cancer may be missed (Table 4.1) . Symptom indices have been developed in attempts to improve the sensitivity and specification of symptoms for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer . The Goff index has a sensitivity of approximately 67% for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and a specificity of approximately 90% . However, the clinical usefulness of such indices depends on how the index is used (higher specificities are achieved when information about symptoms is obtained from clinical notes or questionnaires, rather than by telephone interview), and how index-positive patients are managed . The ongoing ROCkeTS (Refining Ovarian Cancer Test Accuracy Scores) study in the UK aims to validate risk prediction models that estimate the probability of having ovarian cancer for post- and premenopausal women with suspected ovarian cancer, and to define thresholds of predicted risk that inform decisions for patient management . The most established biomarker for ovarian cancer is CA125, the levels of which mainly increase in the later stages of the disease . As a result, CA125 has only limited sensitivity (40-50%) for early-stage ovarian cancer . A more recent tumor marker is the human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4), which is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer . This is used in combination with CA125 and menopausal status in the Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA), which predicts the presence of ovarian cancer in patients with a pelvic mass, with a specificity and sensitivity of up to 95% and 76.4%, respectively; specificity is higher in postmenopausal women . Over all ages, ROMA correctly classified 93.8% of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer as being at high risk . This represents a significant challenge in diagnosing low-volume disease and accurately describing intra-abdominal tumor dissemination patterns . Nevertheless, CT has a well-established role in diagnosing bulky (> 1 cm) lymphadenopathy, distant intraparenchymatous metastatic lesions and additional lesions such as secondary cancers and thromboembolic events that have a significant effect on patient management . Complete surgical staging of ovarian cancer is essential to accurately define the stage of the disease and determine appropriate adjuvant treatment . Up to 30% of patients with apparent early disease will be upstaged after comprehensive staging . Having an accurate FIGO stage will influence the treatment strategies that are most appropriate for the individual patient . The grade of ovarian cancer reflects the degree of distortion from the normal tissue architecture and can correlate with aggressiveness and prognosis .","The majority (> 80%) of women with epithelial ovarian cancer will become apparent and diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease. There are no reliable imaging tools to accurately describe the stage of the disease or tumor dissemination patterns, especially in fine nodular peritoneal carcinomatosis and microscopically involved lymph nodes. Comprehensive surgical staging accurately defines the disease stage, resulting in more reliable prediction of prognosis and more appropriate management strategies and systemic treatment."
9781912776696,hh-5,"Hazard rate is the probability that a subject will die within a given time interval among the subjects alive in that treatment group at the start of that interval . Figure 2.4 shows two hypothetical hazard rate curves that correspond to active (treatment) and control (placebo) groups . Although hazard rates are never constant over time, in many cases (at least approximately) the ratio of the hazard rates, id est the hazard rate for an event in the active group divided by the hazard rate for an event in the control group, will be approximately constant . This means that the hazard rate for death for the patients who received trastuzumab was reduced by 49.8%, on average, over time compared with those who did not receive trastuzumab . While it is possible to compare the survival of patients in two different study groups at any given point in time on the Kaplan-Meier curves, this does not provide a comparison of the total survival experience of the two groups . The logrank test provides a p -value for the total survival experience of the treatment group compared with the control group by comparing the two Kaplan-Meier curves . This will not always be the case and when the HR is not constant the logrank test does not provide an appropriate comparison of the Kaplan-Meier curves . Note that a constant HR manifests itself as Kaplan-Meier curves that start together at time zero but then separate out gradually with time (see Figure 2.2 for an example where this is the case) . The principle of randomizing participants to two (or sometimes more) groups in a study is that, in theory, the two treatment groups are balanced in terms of factors that may influence the outcome . Often these endpoints are measured from the time the participants in a study are randomized into treatment groups . A censored observation can also occur when information on a subject is known for a limited duration only (exempli gratia if a person drops out of a study before the end and is lost to follow-up) . In a study with a fixed 24-month follow-up, a subject who is still alive at month 24 will provide a censored value for OS . These subjects will provide censored values if the event of interest has not occurred during the limited follow-up . Kaplan-Meier curves provide a way of plotting the distribution of a time-to-event endpoint . Kaplan-Meier survival curves are often used to compare the data between two groups of subjects . Figure 2.2 shows Kaplan-Meier curves for OS in a randomized study of patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer treated either with or without trastuzumab . The Kaplan-Meier curve steps down at time points at which deaths occur, while censored observations are denoted by notches on the curve . The Kaplan-Meier curve plots the probability of being event free over time, with these probabilities being estimated from the data in the study . The Kaplan-Meier curves can be used to obtain median survival times (Figure 2.3) .","Typical examples of time-to-event analyses include overall survival, progression-free survival, disease-free survival and duration of response. Censoring is a common feature of all time-to-event endpoints. Observations are said to be censored when the event of interest has not happened by the end of the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier curves plot the probability of being event free over time. The curves from different treatment groups can be plotted against each other to show the differences in outcome. Treatment differences are often expressed as a hazard ratio (HR). An HR of 1 means the risk in the two groups is the same. An HR > 1 means that the risk in one group is higher than the other, and vice versa. The logrank test compares the two Kaplan-Meier curves to provide a p -value for the difference in total survival experience of the two groups. This test can only be used if there is a constant HR, id est the Kaplan-Meier curves start together at time zero and then separate out gradually with time. If the HR is not constant, a treatment difference can be expressed as the difference between two restricted mean survival times (which is equal to the area between two Kaplan-Meier curves). The stratified logrank and the Cox proportional hazards model are two ways of adjusting for imbalances in baseline factors. Baseline variables that are important prognostic factors (exempli gratia age and stage of disease) should be taken into consideration in all statistical analyses, even in randomized studies."
9781908541680,ch_10,"A quarter of children aged 4 to 10 years, with a BMI greater than the 95th centile, have impaired glucose tolerance, 4% have frank type 2 diabetes and 25% have clinical hypertension . Other risk factors include excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy, absence of breast-feeding, excessive caloric intake (particularly from snack foods and sugared drinks such as fruit juice), a sedentary lifestyle (television viewing and time in front of the computer), lack of physical activity and insufficient sleep . Barriers that may prevent primary care providers from having frank conversations about children's weight with parents include parental denial, fear of offending the parents, lack of educational resources for addressing obesity and time constraints . BMI charts show the centiles for boys and girls and the levels of BMI at each age that correspond to the adult categories of overweight and obese (see Table 1.3, Body mass index and waist circumference as measures of adiposity) . Guidelines developed by the UK Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health (RCPCH) and the National Obesity Forum (NOF) recommend a combination of healthy eating, weight management and increased physical activity, as detailed below . However, children over 7 years old with obesity and/or complications may benefit from gradual weight loss of, for example, 0.5 kg per month . Residential weight-loss camps ('fat camps') can be a successful means of inducing weight loss but will only produce long-term benefits if sustainable behavioral techniques are a fundamental element of the program (exempli gratia Carnegie camps for children in the UK provide young people and their families with multidisciplinary re-education and support, including cognitive behavior therapy) . Severely obese children and their families who are considering surgery should discuss the potential benefits and longer-term implications of surgery, as well as the associated risks, in detail with the primary care team who will be involved in their long-term care, as well as with the clinicians responsible for their inpatient treatment . Obesity-related diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, osteoarthritis and pulmonary disease are increasing in the elderly . Similarly, recent data suggest that obese Mediterranean people with type 2 diabetes, aged over 65, had a lower 15-year mortality risk than age-matched peers of normal weight . For overweight elderly individuals in good health, there is no good evidence to show that weight loss reduces mortality risk . In the overweight (but not obese) elderly, weight fluctuation in any direction and irrespective of intention, may increase the risk for mobility limitation . While the benefits of weight loss in the elderly are uncertain, it has been shown that self-selected obese older women can achieve a moderate weight loss and increase in physical activity that results in short-term improvements in physical performance, self-reported function, vitality and life quality outcomes . Although morbidity and mortality are increased in the elderly, the risk:benefit ratio may be acceptable in those who have severe obesity-related comorbidities and restricted mobility . A low-GI diet is associated with lower maternal HbA 1c in pregnancy, and with lower birth weight, the benefit persisting to at least 5 years of age .",In childhood obesity the aim is usually to attenuate weight gain rather than induce weight loss. An elderly person at any given body mass index or waist circumference is always likely to have a higher percentage of fat. Pregnancy is a crucial stage both for the mother and the fetus in preventing and managing future obesity. Management of obesity is different for different age groups; individualization of care with informed patient choice is important. Weight loss is not always an appropriate outcome in an individual; overweight or obesity may provide a protective influence.
9781910797273,chp8,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a clinically heterogeneous condition, and the advice given must be tailored to the individual patient's disease phenotype, medical history and social circumstance . Counseling should not only involve what we know about the disease but also what effect MS will have on all aspects of life, including career, family, travel, insurance and the concerns raised by having a new diagnosis of MS . Once the diagnosis has been established, the neurologist must ensure that the patient is fully informed of all approved treatment options and understands both their benefits and risks . Neurologists are also well-positioned to provide patients with the opportunity to participate in local clinical trials of emerging disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies . They will have access to allied healthcare professionals, and will be able to refer to specialists (neurologist, urologist, obstetrician, psychiatrist, rehabilitation therapist) for the wide range of symptoms and concerns that patients may have at different stages of the disease . In large centers, the advanced practice clinician (APC), who could be a specialist nurse or physician's assistant, has become an integral and invaluable member of the multidisciplinary team . APCs are a reliable source of information about all aspects of MS, and can provide patients with practical advice on living with the condition . Finally, the APC helps patients deal with the social impact of MS and can provide a link to other services such as social workers and clinical psychologists . As well as providing the patient with specific exercises that help prevent the development of contractures and pressure sores, the physiotherapist can offer practical advice and training in fall prevention . Physiotherapists are a valuable source of encouragement, and help to optimize the functional abilities of patients with MS, maintaining a range of movement and limb strength for as long as possible . The occupational therapist works with the patient to allow them to remain independent for as long as possible . It is important that people with MS receive help with housing, transportation, personal finance and insurance, along with other practical assistance as and when required . Psychologists can assess and improve the patient's mood, cognition and coping skills, and assist with adjusting to the new diagnosis, dealing with chronic illness and its challenges, and providing healthy coping skills along with educational support . Continence nurses can assess bladder problems, assist with continence training, provide advice on pelvic floor exercises and urinary aids, and ensure appropriate maintenance of catheters to minimize infection . It is therefore important that people with MS receive appropriate information and support to assist them to stay in education and employment for as long as possible . It is important to highlight to patients that they are not obliged to disclose their illness to everyone at work, according to local laws, but as MS can affect physical, cognitive and emotional functioning, they are likely to need support in the workplace as the disease progresses . If 'reasonable adjustments' can be made to the workplace setting to enable the employee to continue working, in many countries the employer is required by law to make these .","Counseling can be helpful for all people with multiple sclerosis (MS): it will involve explaining the nature of the disease, the risks and benefits of therapy and the effect MS will have on all aspects of life, including career, family, travel and insurance. Common concerns raised by patients include life expectancy, heritability of the disease, long-term planning and effect of pregnancy. Healthcare teams need to stress the importance of overall health and wellness in MS given the known consequences of comorbidities in patients. A multidisciplinary team is important for the coordination of patient care, and comprises neurologists, primary care providers, specialist nurses, physician assistants, physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, social workers, psychologists and continence nurses. Advanced practice clinicians (APCs) are a reliable source of information about all aspects of the condition. They have an important role in helping patients recognize the signs and symptoms of relapse, providing practical advice on living with MS and providing a link with other services. Concerns about employment can become a great source of stress. Employers have an obligation to aid people with MS as much as possible to remain in employment. Functional capacity evaluation and neuropsychological testing can help determine a person's employability."
9781912776276,chp2,"Medications used to treat the motor symptoms of PD, with the exception of the anticholinergic drugs, rarely cause psychosis when used in patients without PD . To date, almost all physiological studies of PDP have evaluated patients with visual hallucinations only, not other hallucinations or delusions, and it has yet to be elucidated whether particular brain structures or neurotransmitter alterations are involved . Several neurochemical abnormalities other than dopaminergic stimulation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of psychotic symptoms . In addition, the evidence indicates that non-drug-related factors may also be involved, including genetics, and structural and visual processing abnormalities . The association between psychotic symptoms and dopamine stimulation, either via dopamine itself or dopamine agonists, is clear, but there is no general dose-response relationship . Hallucinations are not generally associated with ON responses to medications, when brain levels of dopamine are likely to be at their peak, or with the occurrence of dyskinesias, which are usually an indication of high serum levels of dopamine . Indeed, many patients report that the hallucinations only occur at night, on awakening or during the evening, when dopamine levels are likely to be lower, and less commonly during the day . In an experiment to determine a dose-response relationship between serum levodopa levels and hallucinations, patients who reported daily hallucinations in the evenings were brought to the hospital and given intravenous infusions of levodopa that produced higher serum levels of the drug than they received at home . Evidence for serotonin's involvement in the pathophysiology of PDP initially emerged from the observation that several drugs that reduce serotonergic activity improve psychotic symptoms . At low doses, it reduces psychotic symptoms without worsening motor function . An increase in 5HT2A receptors was also found in the temporal cortex of patients with PD who had visual hallucinations . Cholinesterase inhibitors reduce psychotic symptoms in DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) . Yet, patients with Alzheimer's disease are significantly less likely to develop hallucinations or psychosis than patients taking PD medications . A greater number of Lewy bodies have been found in the amygdala and parahippocampus of patients with PD who had visual hallucinations, but not in those who did not hallucinate . A retrospective study of 788 brain autopsies of patients with some form of parkinsonism also found a strong correlation between visual hallucinations and the presence of Lewy bodies in the inferior temporal lobe, although not clearly in the amygdala and parahippocampus . Neurochemical studies have demonstrated an association between hallucinations and reduced overall cholinergic function (as indicated by choline acetyltransferase) in the frontal and temporal cortex of patients with DLB . Amantadine causes the same psychotic symptoms as the dopaminergic and anticholinergic drugs . Reductions in gray matter volume in the visual pathways, frontotemporal, limbic and cholinergic regions and hippocampus of the brain have been reported in patients with PDP but have not been confirmed . Connectivity studies comparing hallucinators and non-hallucinators have reported decreased and increased connectivity between areas of the brain involved in attention and visual processing .","Psychosis is generally due to an interaction between PD medications and PD pathology. Although dopamine stimulation may cause Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), anticholinergics and amantadine cause identical symptoms. The importance of 5HT2A serotonin receptor stimulation is supported by the usefulness of pimavanserin as an antipsychotic drug. Visual hallucinations in PDP have been linked to alterations in visual circuitry in the brain in both functional MRI and MRI connectivity studies, as well as to alterations in both dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter circuits. Cholinergic mechanisms may be more important in both hallucinations and delusions arising in people with dementia with Lewy bodies. Psychotic symptoms are not simply related to drug levels in the brain; they also reflect the state of alertness."
9781910797211,ch03,"Nevertheless, his description of the tremor, posture (Figure 3.1) and clinical course of the disease has stood the test of time and remains valid today . Most cases of Parkinson's disease are easily recognizable at an early stage, but many are missed if tremor is absent; gradual slowing in performance may be instead attributed to aging or aches and pains, and loss of function may be ascribed to other causes . Parkinsonian tremor, while worrying and embarrassing for the patient, is generally a good sign in Parkinson's disease because it can presage a more benign course . Such patients may be misdiagnosed with Parkinson's disease, but DaTSCAN (see page 56) is usually normal in these cases . Eventually, some but not all patients require a wheelchair; however, in the early stages of disease, this is a red flag for an atypical parkinsonian syndrome and the diagnosis should be reappraised . A wide range of non-motor symptoms has been described in Parkinson's disease, all of which are likely to have a major effect on the health-related quality of life of patients . The Movement Disorders Society has recently revised the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, incorporating a range of non-motor symptoms as well as retaining the central core motor features . Recognizing that no diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can be made with 100% certainty and that the error rate can range from 75-95%, the new criteria suggest a two-way process: parkinsonism is first defined using central motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity; these are then considered with respect to ancillary and non-motor issues to determine whether the motor syndrome is likely to be specific to Parkinson's disease or not . The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease remains primarily clinical; there are as yet no specific tests . Many Parkinson-plus syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) also respond initially to levodopa or dopaminergic therapy, so the use of challenge tests for diagnostic purposes is not recommended . The use of DWI and diffusion tensor (MR) imaging (DTI) has been explored and developed in an effort to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's disease from parkinsonism due to other causes such as MSA . Using TCUS, several studies, mainly in Austria and Germany, have reported hyperechogenicity (increased size) of the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease (Figure 3.7) . substantia nigra hyperechogenicity was noted in 103 of 112 patients with clinically diagnosed Parkinson's disease . blinded the sonographer to the clinical diagnosis of 42 patients with Parkinson's disease and 35 controls . The value of SPECT scanning becomes evident in clinical trials involving patients with suspected Parkinson's disease; 4-14% of them have scans with no dopaminergic deficits . chromosome testing for fragile X syndrome, which can present with tremor and ataxia that may mimic Parkinson's disease and MSA . In some countries such as Japan, MIBG cardiac scanning may be useful in the differential diagnosis of Parkinsonian disorders, particularly in the early distinction between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and atypical synucleinopathies such as MSA .","Most cases of Parkinson's disease are recognizable at an early stage, but can be misdiagnosed if tremor is absent. Characteristic motor symptoms include tremor, bradykinesia, a hurried shuffling gait, freezing episodes, rigidity and a bent posture. Non-motor symptoms include depression, dementia, sleep disorders, bowel and bladder problems, fatigue, apathy and pain; although common, these symptoms are often overlooked. There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, but DaTSCAN with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is becoming widely available, and can help to support a clinical diagnosis. Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease show a significant and sustained response to dopaminergic agents. Brain imaging is not typically used to diagnose Parkinson's disease, but may help to rule out tumors, vascular disease and normal-pressure hydrocephalus; transcranial ultrasound scanning reveals characteristic hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra. All patients with a 'suspected' diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be referred untreated to a specialist who can reliably differentiate between Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes. A shared care strategy can then be implemented, with ongoing care by the primary care team."
9781910797006,ch05,"No features specific for COPD are seen on a plain posterior-anterior chest radiograph . The most reliable radiographic signs of emphysema can be classified by their causes of overinflation, vascular changes and bullae . Vascular changes associated with emphysema result from loss of alveolar walls and are shown on the plain chest radiograph by . Assessment of the vascular loss in emphysema clearly depends on the quality of the radiograph . Pulmonary hypertension may be suggested, taking measurements from the plain chest radiograph of the width of the right descending pulmonary artery, just below the right hilum, where the borders of the artery are delineated against the air in the lungs laterally and the right main-stem bronchus medially . Although these measurements can be used to detect the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension, they cannot accurately predict the level of the pulmonary artery pressure and they are not felt to be particularly sensitive . Techniques can be divided into those that use visual assessment of low-density areas on the CT scan, which can be either semiquantitative or quantitative, and those that use CT lung density to quantify areas of low X-ray attenuation . It is generally acceptable to select patients with upper lung zone emphysema for volume reduction surgery by visual inspection of an HRCT by an experienced radiologist and surgeon . Measurement of lung density on CT in terms of Hounsfield units (a scale of X-ray attenuation where bone is +1000 Hounsfield units, water is 0 Hounsfield units and air is −1000 Hounsfield units) provides a more quantitative way of assessing emphysema (Figure 5.3), particularly at the microscopic level . These techniques have not, as yet, been sufficiently standardized for use in clinical practice, but density measurements have been shown to correlate with morphometric measurements of distal airspace size in resected lungs . Whether a bulla is detected on a chest radiograph depends on its size and the degree to which it is obscured by overlying lung . CT scanning is much more sensitive than plain chest radiography in detecting bullae and can be used to determine their number, size and position . Other features can be assessed on the CT scan including bone density, coronary artery calcification and pulmonary artery size . Echocardiography has been used to assess the right ventricle and to detect pulmonary hypertension in COPD . However, overinflation of the chest increases the retrosternal airspace, which then transmits sound waves poorly, making echocardiography difficult in patients with COPD . Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography has been used to assess the ejection flow dynamics of the right ventricle in patients with pulmonary hypertension . Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is the best technique for non-invasive evaluation of pulmonary arterial pressure; the tricuspid gradient assessed in this way can be used to calculate the right ventricular systolic pressure . There is still debate as to whether this technique is sufficiently sensitive and reproducible to monitor longitudinal changes in pulmonary arterial pressure and the effects of therapeutic interventions, particularly in patients with COPD .","No features on plain chest radiography are specific for COPD. The features usually described are those of severe emphysema, but no abnormality may be visible, even in patients with marked disability. CT scans can be used to quantify emphysema, either by visual assessment of high-resolution scanning or by CT lung density measurements. CT scanning is the best way to detect and assess bullous disease. CT scanning is the standard way to assess patients for volume reduction surgery. Echocardiography, particularly continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography, can be used to assess pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with COPD."
9781908541666,ch_8,"Treatment of people with type 2 diabetes requires consideration of several aspects of the patient's health, and the range of areas is summarized in Table 7.1 . It is important to consider care for the patient with type 2 diabetes from the perspective of a multidisciplinary team, with contributions from medical practitioners, nurse educators, dietitians and podiatrists . At diagnosis, the patient should be given simple and clear messages about diabetes and how it may affect health with regard to complications and cardiovascular risk . Importantly, patients should be encouraged that, with excellent glucose, lipid and blood pressure control and smoking cessation, risks of complications and cardiovascular events can be reduced substantially . Education of the person with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes is critical in helping them to take an active role in their own management . A family history of diabetic complications or heart disease is useful, as this may signpost a genetic predisposition to nephropathy or cardiovascular disease that helps identify patients for more aggressive prevention (for example, blood pressure normalization and excellent glucose and lipid control in those with a family history of diabetic nephropathy with chronic renal failure) . A prior history or family history of myocardial infarction or heart disease mandates therapeutic targets of perfect lipids and blood pressure control, together with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) or anticoagulant as required . Dietary intervention and increased physical activity are the cornerstones of management in the patient with diabetes and are discussed in detail in chapter 8 . A patient diagnosed with diabetes requires follow-up to determine whether diet, physical activity interventions and exercise and, where necessary, weight loss have sufficiently controlled capillary glucose levels and achieved optimal levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) . If glucose monitoring or HbA 1c levels indicate suboptimal control, drug therapy needs to be considered . In this regard, it is quite useful in obese or overweight patients with higher fasting glucose levels when given at the evening meal . If glycemic control remains above the target range in patients receiving metformin, or metformin is not tolerated, another agent can be added to the treatment regimen, after ensuring that dietary intervention and physical activity are being adhered to . Adverse effects include weight gain and fluid retention, which can precipitate cardiac failure in patients with underlying cardiac disease; rosiglitazone has been implicated in increased coronary risk, although this remains controversial . In obese patients with type 2 diabetes, consideration should be given to obesity-management strategies, including bariatric surgery (see chapter 8) . Modest weight reduction of 5 kg can significantly improve glucose control, in addition to benefitting other metabolic factors that accompany diabetes, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, sleep apnea and non-alcoholic liver disease . Risk reduction includes lifestyle management (including diet, weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation and blood pressure control) . Table 7.4 provides a number of questions that may help to reveal aspects of an individual patient's life that need to be addressed in order to facilitate improved diabetes self-care and/or improve glycemic and other healthcare targets .","Type 2 diabetes management requires patient education on the fundamentals of self-care, including monitoring of glucose levels, dietary management - with an emphasis on weight reduction in the overweight or obese - increased physical activity and reduced sedentariness. Medications are often required for glucose control. There are multiple classes of glucose-lowering medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors and insulin. Glycemic treatment targets aim for an HbA 1c that ranges from 6.0% to 7.0%, depending on the age of the patients and their risk for hypoglycemia. All patients with type 2 diabetes who smoke must receive smoking cessation intervention(s). Cardiovascular risk factors must be treated to targets, including lipids and blood pressure. Consideration should be given to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) therapy where appropriate. Bariatric surgery should be considered in the obese with type 2 diabetes and poor glycemic control. Open dialogue between healthcare professionals and patients is important in order to identify factors that may be undermining self-care, and to rectify poor glucose control early."
9781910797495,chp8,"It is now clear from numerous studies that persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) is one of the major causes of persistent (chronic) pain . Limited data also indicate that a significant percentage of patients continue to have pain following trauma, particularly trauma to multiple body areas or traumatic amputation . Although there is evidence that nerve damage plays a key role, there are other factors that probably determine which patients with nerve damage progress from acute to persistent pain as, in many operations (exempli gratia amputation), all patients have nerve damage but only a percentage (10-50%) progress to chronic pain (Table 8.1) . It is possible, but not studied, that similar factors may occur in post-trauma patients (many of whom also undergo surgery) . Preoperative pain intensity has been correlated with postoperative pain intensity in a prospective study of 346 patients undergoing abdominal surgery . Thus, improved acute pain control pre- and postoperatively may help to prevent PPSP . Surgical technique may play a role, as 'nerve preservation' techniques appear to lower the incidence of PPSP - although no studies have prospectively addressed this area . This serves to illustrate how difficult it is to avoid trauma to nerves at various surgical sites, and that factors other than nerve injury are involved in PPSP . In the early stages of PPSP surgeons tend to suspect a surgical complication of some sort (exempli gratia a wound hematoma, chronic infection, incomplete repair of an inguinal hernia) . As the majority of PPSP is caused by nerve damage, the treatment options are similar to those for other neuropathic pain syndromes . For example, patients are rarely told that PPSP is a possible complication of surgery . Preoperative patient education about the possibility of PPSP, during the informed consent procedure, may reduce the negative postoperative psychosocial consequences that can complicate treatment . In the authors' experience of patients with PPSP, and supported by several studies, psychosocial factors such as catastrophizing and the pain itself often activate stress and mood disorders, thus worsening pain and interfering with adaptive coping . As with other neuropathic pain syndromes, patients exhibit allodynia and sometimes also edema in the vicinity of the surgical wound, which is typical of temporary peripheral sensitization . Postamputation persistent pain is a special case of PPSP because large nerves are deliberately cut in all patients . For example, when the amputation occurs because of a progressive disease, such as diabetes, disease-related preoperative nerve damage and pain are involved . A phantom experience is a non-painful sensation; phantom pain is pain in an absent body part; and stump pain is local pain in the residual limb (id est at the amputation site) . Phantom sensations and phantom pain typically begin within days of the amputation, and tend to decrease in frequency and duration over time, though they persist for years in 40% of amputees . There is a scarcity of controlled trial results to guide clinicians in the treatment of phantom pain, and clinicians must rely on favorable results from clinical research in which these agents have been given to treat other neuropathic pain syndromes .","Persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) is defined as pain at or close to the site of surgical incision that persists beyond the expected healing period. The incidence of PPSP varies from about 10% for very limited peripheral surgery, such as inguinal hernia repair or joint replacement, to 10-30% for mastectomy and up to 50% for thoracotomy and amputation. Nerve injury plays an important role in pathogenesis, but genetics, pre-existing pain and severity of postoperative pain are also risk factors, in addition to cancer treatment and possible psychosocial factors. Patients who catastrophize, which increases postoperative pain and opioid analgesic use, may benefit from psychological services such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Effective acute pain control may be preventive for PPSP - for example, intra- and postoperative use of epidural analgesia can prevent PPSP following some operations. Pharmacotherapy is based on the study results of neuropathic drugs used to treat pain caused by other types of nerve injury. Tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants are first-line drugs. Peripheral nerve stimulation is emerging as a possible treatment option for severe PPSP. Although spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has not been found to be successful for amputation pain, early data indicate positive outcomes for dorsal root (DRG) stimulation."
9781910797211,ch05,". Surgery is usually employed in patients when manipulations of drug therapy have failed to control 'off' symptoms, tremor, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias . However, in carefully selected patients surgery leads to control of 'off' symptoms, motor fluctuations and dyskinesias . For these patients, the operation of choice is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamus to enable a reduction in dopaminergic therapy and control of dyskinesias . Ideally, surgical centers should take part in collaborative trials to evaluate the potential of lesional surgery and compare this older technique with deep brain stimulation . Given the evidence base for the safety and efficacy of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease (see pages 103 -), pallidotomy is rarely performed nowadays . A meta-analysis of outcomes from cohorts of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation of the STN suggests that dyskinesia is reduced by 69.1% (95% CI: 62-76.2%), the daily 'off' period is reduced by 68.2% (95% CI: 58-79%) and health-related quality of life is improved by 34.5 +- 15.3% . The VA trial comparing stimulation of the STN with that of the globus pallidus in patients with Parkinson's disease showed that the motor improvement was similar in the two targets but certain cognitive functions and depression worsened after STN stimulation . Non-motor symptoms are common, present in early and advanced stages of the disease and have a huge effect on patients' health-related quality of life . Long-term follow up of carefully selected patients indicates that STN deep brain stimulation is a safe procedure with regard to most non-motor symptoms . The number and severity of some non-motor symptoms decrease significantly after STN deep brain stimulation, resulting in a significant improvement in quality of life and activities of daily living . Worsening of non-motor symptoms, especially in the neuropsychological and psychiatric domains, is most often seen transiently in the immediate postoperative period after STN deep brain stimulation, possibly related to the changes in dopamine replacement therapy or the surgery itself . demonstrated that subthalamic neurostimulation resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the quality of life of patients under 75 years of age with advanced Parkinson's disease who had severe fluctuations in mobility and dyskinesia . In the EARLYSTIM study (see below), STN deep brain stimulation had the same positive effects on motor function, fluctuations and quality of life in patients with a much earlier stage of Parkinson's disease . The changes in motor function in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease also led to improvement in activities of daily living and quality of life (emotional wellbeing, stigma and bodily discomfort) . The authors concluded that STN stimulation was superior to conventional medical treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease with early motor complications . in 2001, involving 40 patients randomized to fetal neural transplant or sham surgery, primary outcome measures failed to show any significant differences between the two groups . reported 1 patient with a 23-year history of Parkinson's disease who developed side effects after intraventricular infusion of GDNF, with no improvement in parkinsonian symptoms and no evidence at postmortem examination of regeneration .","Surgery is recommended when optimal drug treatment options have failed to control symptoms. Neurosurgery is an unpleasant experience for the patient; the main complications are stroke and infection. For patients with young-onset Parkinson's disease who have had 'on/off' symptoms for many years, the procedure of choice is deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus to reduce dopaminergic therapy and control dyskinesias. Lesional surgery is an alternative to deep brain stimulation for patients unlikely to attend regular follow-up or who have to travel long distances, or in instances where the cost of a stimulator is prohibitive. Pallidotomy is appropriate for severe dyskinesia. Thalamic deep brain surgery (VIM nucleus) is the most effective procedure for controlling parkinsonian tremor. In the future, nerve-cell transplantation could replace dopaminergic treatment if sources of dopamine cells other than 6-10-week-old fetuses can be found; trials using porcine fetal cells, stem cells that generate dopamine and other such cells (exempli gratia retinal cells) are under way."
9781908541406,ch_3,"If a vessel wall is damaged, a number of mechanisms are promptly activated to limit bleeding by a complex series of interrelated reactions involving endothelial cells, plasma coagulation factors, platelets and fibrinolytic proteins . Secondary hemostasis involves activation of the coagulation system, leading to the generation of fibrin strands, which are laid down between platelets and reinforce the platelet plug . In reality, these processes tend to merge, with the activated platelet and endothelial cell membranes providing the foundation on which the clotting factors can become activated, and fibrin formed and lysed . Blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells, which promote hemostasis and keep the blood fluid by preventing excessive deposition of fibrin through the synthesis and secretion of various antithrombotic agents . Antithrombotic agents secreted by endothelial cells include: heparan sulfate, which inhibits activated clotting factors; prostacyclin and nitric oxide, which inhibit platelet aggregation and induce vasodilatation; and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which promotes the dissolution of fibrin that is deposited within the vasculature . The platelet membrane glycoprotein 1b-IX-V becomes the receptor for high-molecular-weight strings of VWF, released from Weibel-Palade bodies in the endothelial cells (see above) . Thus, the activated platelet membrane provides a surface on which the components of coagulation can gather very rapidly, leading to the development of a 'fibrin-reinforced' stable platelet plug . The participation of platelets and endothelial cells in the formation of the platelet plug is mediated by inhibitors: ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 13) cleaves the high-molecular-weight strings of VWF, ADP is converted to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) by ADPase, and platelet aggregation is inhibited by nitric oxide and prostacyclin, which also are vasodilators . The coagulation factors are a series of plasma proteins synthesized by the liver that, when activated, generate thrombin and convert fibrinogen to fibrin via a sequence of complex reactions . P-selectin is exposed on activated endothelial cells and binds to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand on leukocytes and platelets, initiating the rolling of these cells on the endothelium toward the site of injury and the release of membrane microparticles (Figure 1.2) . Thrombin is a potent activator of platelets, which provide an enhanced catalytic surface on which further coagulation is promoted . The activated platelets release hemostatic factors (exempli gratia fibrinogen and VWF) and polyphosphate, which accelerate the activation of FXI by thrombin . The small amounts of thrombin that are formed during the initiation phase activate FV, FVIII and FXI, leading to the formation of sufficient thrombin to overcome inhibitors and generate fibrin from fibrinogen, as well as activate FXIII to cross-link the fibrin and form a stable clot (Figure 1.3) . The plasma contains a series of proteins that inhibit activated procoagulant enzymes and prevent excessive intravascular coagulation . Tissue factor pathway inhibitor binds FXa, forming a complex that rapidly inhibits the TF-FVIIa complex . This pathway is initiated by thrombin when it binds to thrombomodulin on the endothelial surface and activates protein C bound to its receptor on the cell membrane . TF-FVIIa complex is inhibited by tissue factor pathway inhibitor .","The immediate arrest of hemorrhage depends on vasoconstriction together with the adhesion and aggregation of platelets at the site of vessel injury. The coagulation system is activated by tissue factor expression. This binds and converts factor (F)VII to FVIIa, which initiates a catalytic series of reactions leading to the rapid generation of small amounts of thrombin. Trace concentrations of thrombin trigger the explosive generation of a much larger quantity of thrombin by activating FXI, FVIII and FV in a positive feedback loop. Thrombin further promotes the stability of the platelet-fibrin hemostatic plug by activating platelets, FXIII (cross-linking fibrin strands) and thrombin activatable fibrinolytic inhibitor."
9781908541277,ch_11,"Levonorgestrel implants are contraindicated in women taking enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) as they have an unacceptably high failure rate . The effectiveness of the hormonal method of emergency contraception is reduced by enzyme-inducing drugs; a copper intrauterine device may be offered, or the dose of levonorgestrel should be increased . Some women find that their seizures worsen mid-cycle or around menstruation, a phenomenon known as catamenial epilepsy . During pregnancy, metabolic processes change and close attention needs to be given to AED concentrations . Women whose epilepsy is well controlled usually remain seizure free during pregnancy and delivery . Although it would be ideal to withdraw AED treatment in women contemplating pregnancy, for many this would result in recurrence or exacerbation of seizures that could be dangerous for both mother and fetus . If AED therapy cannot be withdrawn completely, it should be tapered to a minimally effective dose of, if possible, a single drug . These and other guidelines for managing epilepsy in women who are contemplating pregnancy are set out in Table 8.2 . The incidence of minor and major fetal malformations increases in women with epilepsy, even if they are untreated . The risk increases disproportionately with the number of AEDs taken, being approximately 3% for one drug (similar to background risk), 5% for two, 10% for three and over 20% in women taking more than three AEDs (Figure 8.2) . Current evidence suggests that the risk of major congenital malformations is two to four times higher with the use of VPA than with other AEDs such as CBZ and LTG . The older enzyme-inducing AEDs (CBZ, PHT, PB and PRM) can cause transient and reversible deficiency in vitamin K1-dependent clotting factors in the neonate . The Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry was established in the USA in 1996 to determine prospectively the risk of major malformations from AEDs . All physicians who care for women taking AEDs during pregnancy are invited to contribute . The number of elderly people diagnosed with epilepsy is set to rise further with the aging of the population . AEDs are the mainstay of treatment, and are effective in most patients . Elderly patients are particularly sensitive to the adverse effects of AEDs, possibly because of age-related pharmacokinetic changes caused by the delay in gastric emptying, reduction in body fat, and decreased hepatic metabolism and renal elimination . Sympathetic explanation and assured support will help an elderly person regain their self-confidence after epilepsy has been diagnosed and AED treatment established . In patients with multiple concomitant medications, AEDs that do not produce pharmacokinetic interactions are the preferred choice (see Table 4.6) . Double-blind trials support the newer agents LTG and GBP over CBZ for the treatment of partial seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), primarily because they produce fewer neurotoxic side effects . Children who develop epilepsy should be re-evaluated during their teenage years, and AED levels should be monitored . The teenage years are an appropriate time for counseling on contraception, clarifying the possible side effects of AEDs, and predicting prognosis and eventual drug withdrawal .","Oral contraceptives containing at least 50 µg of estrogen should be used when coadministered with carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone and rufinamide, and topiramate at doses over 200 mg daily, because these drugs induce the metabolism of female sex hormones. Intermittent clobazam just before and shortly after the onset of menstruation can be used in women who experience catamenial seizures. The risk of major malformations in babies exposed in utero seems to be greater with sodium valproate (VPA) than with other AEDs. AED treatment is continued when necessary during pregnancy because seizures, especially convulsive seizures, are more harmful to the mother and fetus than the drugs themselves; however, treatment should be tapered to a minimally effective dose before pregnancy, if possible to a single AED. Supplemental folic acid, 4-5 mg daily, should be administered before conception and continued at least until the end of week 12 of gestation. A witness's account is particularly important for the correct diagnosis of epilepsy in the elderly, in whom the presentation of seizures is often subtle. Low doses of AEDs are recommended in the elderly in order to minimize adverse effects, particularly neurotoxicity. Preferred choices include lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV). The teenage years are an appropriate time for counseling on contraception and other lifestyle issues including driving, social interactions and careers. Broad-spectrum AEDs (exempli gratia VPA, LTG, TPM, LEV, zonisamide) should be the treatment of choice in people with learning difficulties; barbiturates and benzodiazepines should be avoided."
9781908541086,ch_10,"The course of anorexia is variable, with remission rates differing considerably across long-term outcome studies with follow-up periods of 1-30 years . In over 100 studies published in the second half of the 20th century, fewer than one half of anorexic patients recovered on average, whereas one-third improved, and 20% remained chronically ill . In seven studies published since 2004, most patients with anorexia ascertained through outpatient settings had achieved remission by 5-year follow-up, but inpatient samples had lower remission rates . In these most recent studies, rates of continued anorexia at follow-up ranged from 2% in a 9-year follow-up of patients at a community clinic, to 18% at 12 years for individuals from an inpatient center; other participants who did not achieve remission over the course of follow-up had moved to a diagnosis of either bulimia or eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) . One consistent finding across long-term studies has been that a large proportion of anorexic patients followed over time suffered from additional psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, affective disorders, substance-use disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and borderline or histrionic personality disorders; schizophrenia is only rarely observed at follow-up . In long-term outcome studies of anorexia nervosa, the findings regarding prognostic factors have also been very heterogeneous . Most studies indicated that a short duration of symptoms before treatment resulted in a favorable outcome, but findings are ambiguous regarding age at onset of illness . No definite conclusions could be drawn as to whether greater weight loss at presentation had long-term effects on outcome, but it is clear that vomiting, bulimia and purgative abuse imply an unfavorable prognosis . In addition, the data clearly show that chronicity leads to negative outcome, a finding that implies that there are cases of anorexia refractory to treatment . A cross-cultural study revealed that the outcome of an adolescent eating disorder is relatively similar across cultures, and that a later onset leads to a better prognosis . In a prospective 21-year follow-up study, 16% of 84 patients with anorexia had died from the disorder and its complications . Recent data are available on the longitudinal course of bulimia from a total of 79 study series covering over 5000 patients followed between 6 months and 12 years . On average, close to 45% of the patients showed full recovery from bulimia, whereas 27% improved considerably, and nearly 23% had a chronic protracted course . The data suggest a curvilinear course, with highest recovery rates between 4 and 9 years of follow-up, and reverse peaks for both improvement and chronicity before 4 years and after 10 years of follow-up . As stated above, the course and outcome for women with bulimia is generally more favorable than for those with anorexia . A study in the UK found that bulimia and binge-eating disorder among young women had different courses and outcomes . While the prognosis of those with bulimia was relatively poor, the majority of those with binge-eating disorder recovered during a 5-year follow-up period .","Despite increasing research on short- and long-term outcomes of anorexia, the disease still has a relatively poor prognosis; the mortality rate is the highest of all psychiatric disorders, although it has decreased in recent years. Although results from long-term studies support optimism for most patients with eating disorders, approximately 30% of patients with bulimia and atypical eating disorders remain ill at 10-20 years following presentation. Anorexia can have serious effects on reproductive functioning and the health of neonates. Bulimia usually persists for several years, and associated medical complications can result in intermittent hospitalization."
9781910797457,chp5,"Risk groups are generally divided into very low, low, intermediate and high risk of recurrence and are based on Gleason grade group (see pages 14 -), number of biopsy cores involved, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and clinical stage (Table 5.2) . As men with localized disease often do not experience significant disease-related morbidity for many years after diagnosis, and curative treatment itself may result in some morbidity, those with lower-risk cancers and a shorter life expectancy are least likely to benefit from radical treatment . Radical prostatectomy involves surgical removal of the entire prostate and seminal vesicles and a variable amount of adjacent tissue (Figure 5.1), and is appropriate if it is believed that the tumor can be removed completely, and where the patient satisfies the criteria set out in Table 5.4 . A randomized study from Sweden showed that, at a median follow-up of 8.2 years, radical prostatectomy decreased prostate-cancer-related mortality by 44% and overall death by 26% when compared with watchful waiting . A similar US study, the Prostate Cancer Intervention Versus Observation Trial (PIVOT), which had a high proportion of patients with low-risk prostate cancer, reported no difference in overall survival (OS) at a median follow-up of 10 years, but radical prostatectomy in men with high-risk cancers provided a 60% reduction in prostate cancer mortality . The most recent study, ProtecT, randomized men with predominantly low- and intermediate-risk cancers to active surveillance, radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy . The outcomes at 10 years showed no difference in mortality between surgery and radiotherapy, while those on active surveillance had a substantially greater risk (almost double) of developing metastases than those who underwent active treatment . This study has been criticized on the basis of the allocation of intermediate-risk patients to active surveillance, and because a difference in mortality between surgery and radiotherapy would not be expected as early as 10 years in men with predominantly low/intermediate-risk disease . A recent randomized study that compared outcomes with open and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy found no substantial differences in incontinence, erectile function and positive margins at 3 months . The recently completed CHHiP trial (Conventional or Hypofractionated High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer) showed that hypofractionation can decrease the duration of radiotherapy delivery to 4 weeks but with no difference in cancer recurrence rates or side effects; however, this study has been criticized for undertreating the control arm with only 74 Gy . This approach has been validated in randomized trials, which showed that both progression-free survival and OS were significantly improved when men with high-risk prostate cancers were treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy and EBRT . A recent small study in men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer demonstrated the feasibility of MRI-TRUS fusion (see page 48) focal cryotherapy in the majority of patients, and accurately guided ablation, as demonstrated by post-treatment imaging, with little genitourinary toxicity . In addition, a very large international randomized trial, with median follow-up of 7.4 years, showed that adjuvant treatment with bicalutamide, 150 mg/day, plus standard therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer (id est surgery, radiotherapy or watchful waiting) significantly reduced objective progression by 31% when compared with standard therapy .","The treatment of localized prostate cancer is controversial. Active surveillance is increasingly used for very-low- and low-risk disease. Only about one-third of men managed with active surveillance will go on to require curative treatment. Radical prostatectomy probably offers the best prospect of long-term cure but carries the disadvantages of possible sexual dysfunction and incontinence. In the case of high-risk cancer, surgery may be considered as part of a multimodal therapeutic approach. External-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) can be curative but may be associated with rectal or bladder complications. Brachytherapy can be combined with EBRT in higher-risk individuals. Treatment with EBRT and hormonal therapy is more effective than radiotherapy alone in men with intermediate- and high-risk cancer. In a large international trial, the antiandrogen bicalutamide, 150 mg/day, reduced objective progression by 31% but gynecomastia was common."
9781910797662,ch06,"ERAS protocols have demonstrated benefits in the post-operative management of patients undergoing radical cystectomy, with quicker return of bowel function and shorter length of hospital stay . Long-term tumor control outcomes following radical cystectomy vary considerably; 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of 58-62% are reported in contemporary series . Other risk factors can also affect outcomes in addition to the tumor-node-metastases (TNM) stage, including age, presence of CIS or lymphovascular invasion, and use of peri-operative chemotherapy, and there is considerable variation in outcomes within TNM stages . Nomograms have been developed in an effort to more accurately predict recurrence, cancer-specific survival and overall survival following radical cystectomy . Although open radical cystectomy is considered to be the gold standard for treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, recent series have demonstrated the safety of a minimally invasive surgical approach using robotic-assisted radical cystectomy . The aim of this approach is to reduce blood loss, length of hospital stay, and morbidity compared with open surgery, while maintaining long-term tumor control . Peri-operative treatment for intermediate- or high-risk bladder cancer . Additional treatment approaches should be considered for the management of organ-confined cancer that is at high risk of local or distant recurrence . Adjuvant therapy refers to additional treatment given after definitive primary treatment, with the intention of destroying microscopic residual cancer cells in order to reduce the risk of local or distant relapse . A large number of clinical trials have explored the benefits of perioperative therapies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer . Toxicities are generally similar to those seen in the metastatic setting; however, patients who have had incomplete resolution of the adverse effects of surgery are less able to tolerate post-operative chemotherapy . All patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stage T2 or above) without distant metastases should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting . Patients considered suitable for systemic chemotherapy should be offered cisplatin-based neoadjuvant therapy . Adjuvant therapy should still be considered for patients requiring urgent surgical management . Patients who are unfit for cisplatin may expect smaller benefits, which may influence decisions about whether perioperative therapy is appropriate . Whilst radical cystectomy is the curative modality used for most patients with cancer that is clinically confined to the bladder, not all patients are medically suitable for this procedure, or choose not to undergo it . Bladder-conserving definitive treatment can be considered for appropriate patients - generally those with smaller-volume cancers . Finally, some patients may benefit from multimodality approaches combining two or more of surgery, radiation therapy and systemic treatment . Unfortunately, there is no high-level evidence that compares bladder-preserving approaches and radical cystectomy . A large retrospective study of 348 patients with stage T2-T4a disease assessed outcomes after treatment with cisplatin and radiation therapy in the context of maximal transurethral resection of tumor, and neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy . The expected outcome is improvement in local control, rather than prevention or management of distant metastatic disease . Notably, patients receiving radiation therapy with palliative intent probably should not receive concurrent cytotoxic radiosensitizer treatment, as there is no evidence of improved palliative outcomes and the risk of toxicity is increased substantially .","Bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment is not indicated for bladder cancer that is T2 or higher. Surgical resection (radical or partial cystectomy) is the mainstay of treatment for patients suitable for surgery. Adequate node dissection should be performed at the time of cystectomy. For patients being managed with curative intent, chemoradiotherapy should be considered as an alternative to surgery, with appropriate multidisciplinary input. Cytotoxic drugs are used in the context of chemoradiotherapy with the intention of improving local disease control rather than achieving distant control. Toxicity is greater with combined chemotherapy and radiation than with radiation therapy alone. Patients treated with palliative intent are probably best offered radiation therapy only if surgery is not appropriate."
9781910797150,ch05,"Even with improved control of acute and delayed CINV and adequate antiemetic prophylaxis, breakthrough CINV within 5 days of chemotherapy administration (see page 17) remains a significant clinical problem . The US National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines suggest treating breakthrough CINV with an agent from a drug class that was not used in the prophylactic regimen and recommend continuing the breakthrough medication if nausea and vomiting is controlled with that specific agent . Olanzapine and metoclopramide have been the only agents studied for the treatment of breakthrough CINV in phase III clinical trials . In a phase III clinical trial involving 80 patients on highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC), a 3-day regimen of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day, was shown to be superior to 3 days of oral metoclopramide, 10 mg 3 times daily . On this basis, the NCCN guidelines state that patients who develop nausea or vomiting after chemotherapy (days 1 to 5) despite adequate prophylaxis should be considered for treatment with a 3-day regimen of oral olanzapine, 10 mg/day . Despite the lack of phase III clinical trials, current guidelines also suggest the use of a phenothiazine, metoclopramide, dexamethasone, dopamine antagonists (exempli gratia prochlorperazine, haloperidol), benzodiazepines, an anticholinergic, or olanzapine . A 5-HT receptor antagonist (RA) may also be effective unless a patient presents with breakthrough nausea and vomiting that developed after the use of a 5-HT RA as prophylaxis for chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced emesis (see Table 5.1) . It is important to note that although the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists (aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant, rolapitant) have been approved as additive agents to a 5-HT receptor antagonist and dexamethasone for the prevention of CINV, they have not been studied and should not be used to treat breakthrough nausea and vomiting . A change in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen should be considered for those patients who develop CINV during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy when antiemetic prophylaxis has not been successful in controlling CINV in earlier cycles . If the patient is receiving HEC, olanzapine (days 1 to 4) can be substituted for the NK-1 RA in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen . If the patient is receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC), aprepitant or fosaprepitant can be added to the palonosetron and dexamethasone antiemetic regimen . NCCN guidelines recommend the use of olanzapine, palonosetron and dexamethasone as an alternative first-line prophylactic antiemetic regimen for patients receiving HEC . Patients should be informed that very effective prophylactic antiemetic regimens will be used and that 70-75% of patients have a complete response (id est no emesis and no use of rescue medications) . For optimum control of CINV during the first course of chemotherapy, each patient should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen based on the specific type of chemotherapy (see Tables 4.1 and 4.2, pages 54-7) and their individual risk factors (see Table 2.2, page 18) before the first course of chemotherapy . If anticipatory CINV occurs despite the use of guideline-directed prophylactic antiemetics, additional antiemetic drugs do not seem to be effective .","Breakthrough CINV within 5 days of chemotherapy administration remains a significant clinical problem despite the development of effective agents for the prevention of CINV. Olanzapine has been shown in a phase III clinical trial to be an effective treatment. A change in the prophylactic antiemetic regimen should be considered for those patients who develop refractory CINV. If the patient has a poor experience with CINV in the first cycle, anticipatory CINV may develop requiring behavioral therapy. Optimum control of CINV during the first course of chemotherapy may prevent breakthrough, refractory and anticipatory CINV. Each patient should receive the most effective prophylactic antiemetic regimen based on the specific type of chemotherapy and their individual risk factors before the first course of chemotherapy."
9781912776696,hh-10,"Kaplan-Meier curves are discussed in Chapter 2 in conjunction with the analysis of time-to-event endpoints (see Figures 2.2 and 2.3) . In this chapter, Figure 7.1 shows two sets of curves in the open-label ToGA trial, which compared treatment with trastuzumab and chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer . When event rates are low, plotting Kaplan-Meier curves in the conventional way can be problematic since the probability of being event free will stay close to 1 through time and there will be little definition regarding possible separation of the curves . In this regard, it is convenient to think in terms of curves plotted in reverse (see Kaplan-Meier curves above) in order to calculate the probability of the event occurring by time t . These two cumulative incidence functions can be estimated from data and plotted on the same graph, and it is easy to show the overall reverse Kaplan-Meier probability at time t for the composite PFS as it is the sum of these two cumulative incidence function curves . In this chapter, Figure 7.3 displays data from the ToGA trial, comparing the effect of trastuzumab and chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in terms of OS . An example of a forest plot for presentation of trial data in a meta-analysis is shown in Figure 7.4 . The funnel plot helps to detect the presence of publication bias by plotting the treatment effect in each study (exempli gratia the HR or relative risk [RR]/risk ratio) on the x -axis against some function of the precision of the study (exempli gratia the number of events observed or the standard error of the log HR) on the y -axis . If, however, there is publication bias then the non-significant studies (very often those with smaller sample sizes) will be under-represented and the lower right-hand part of the plot with HRs of around 1 or above, will be missing (Figure 7.5) . In the data from the meta-analysis depicted in Figure 7.5, the RR was 0.58 (log RR = -0.54); this value is depicted by the vertical line in the funnel plot . Swimmer plots also focus on individual patient data and display key events during treatment and follow-up, such as start of response, end of response, end of treatment, progression and death (Figure 7.7) . Bars can also be color coded to differentiate treatment groups or tumor types, or separated appropriately as with waterfall plots (see Figure 7.7) . The purpose here is to present key adverse event data in a single plot, which highlights where treatment differences lie (Figure 7.10) . The events displayed in Figure 7.10 are the most frequent adverse events in two treatment groups and are potentially those of greatest concern . In Figure 7.11, each patient can be represented by a single point, with the treatment groups identified using different colors/symbols in the plot . The shift plot in Figure 7.11 has the laboratory value at the end of treatment on the y -axis .","Kaplan-Meier curves are used to display data on a time-to-event endpoint. Cumulative incidence functions are used with a composite endpoint when there is interest in separating out the different components of the composite. Forest plots display results for subgroups in a clinical trial, or across a series of trials in a meta-analysis. The change in tumor burden from baseline over a treatment period or through to the end of follow-up at the individual patient level can be displayed in a waterfall plot. Swimmer plots also identify key events during treatment at the individual patient level. Box and whisker plots look at the distribution of data and can be used for laboratory parameters, vital signs and QTc intervals over time or across different tumor types. Relative risks for adverse events can be displayed for the most frequent adverse events to highlight where treatment differences lie. Concerning increases in laboratory parameters from baseline can be identified by plotting, relative to the normal range, the baseline value on the x -axis and the maximum value over time on the y -axis in trellis plots."
9781908541062,ch_5,"This could reflect a genuine difference in prevalence but could also be explained by other factors, such as a lower mortality from RA-associated infections in the town-dwellers or differences in the age structure of the two communities . Furthermore, the improvement in life expectancy seen in the general population over recent years does not appear to have extended to the RA population, resulting in a widening gap in mortality rates (Figure 4.1) . The causes of death are largely those prevalent in society as a whole, such as ischemic heart disease, infections and malignancies . RA patients are also twice as likely to develop heart failure, even allowing for traditional risk factors and ischemic heart disease . Clinical and subclinical inflammation probably provide the critical risk factors for ischemic heart disease although this remains to be definitively proven, particularly because atherosclerosis itself has an inflammatory pathogenesis (see Chapter 3) . The overall malignancy risk in RA is similar to that in the general population, although there is a slight increase in immune system neoplasms such as lymphomas (approximately twice as common in RA) and multiple myeloma . Lung cancer is also increased in RA, presumably because smoking is a risk factor for the disease, whereas colorectal cancer is reduced, probably reflecting a protective effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) . In part this is secondary to immunosuppressive drug therapy (particularly corticosteroids) and chronic ill health but there is also evidence for suppressed immunity even in early disease, potentially linked to the effects of chronically elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) . Some recent studies have suggested that early intervention with antirheumatic drugs such as methotrexate and TNF blockade has reduced the overall severity of RA, with a concomitant reduction in mortality . More studies are required to provide a definitive answer, however, particularly within the context of the lack of overall reduction in mortality seen in general epidemiological studies . Intangible costs reflect the psychosocial consequences of RA that impact on psychological wellbeing and quality of life . The direct costs divide approximately equally between primary and secondary care, with an increasing proportion of spend attributable to biological therapies (£160 million annually) . Work disability in RA varies between studies, but functional disability invariably occurs in the absence of early and effective treatment . A UK-based study from the pre-biologic era, of patients with disease of an average duration of 6 months, reported only 33% of patients with normal function at presentation and 10% of patients with severe disability . Other studies suggest an even higher rate of work disability, with a third of patients ceasing work within 2 years of diagnosis, although early biological therapy has had a major impact on job retention and employment prospects . If, in addition, function and employment are retained, total direct, indirect and intangible costs will be significantly reduced . A recent estimate from the UK National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society suggests that the loss of productivity when a patient stops work because of RA equates to almost £300000 .","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a global disease, present in all populations studied. RA should not be viewed as a benign chronic disease of the elderly. The peak age of onset occurs during working life, severely reducing participation and productivity. Furthermore, mortality is increased and there is very significant comorbidity. The disease inflicts huge economic costs on both the individual and society. It is essential that total healthcare and societal costs are considered when the economic impact of new drugs is considered. It remains to be determined whether the new targeted biological therapies will reduce the mortality associated with RA."
9781910797853,chp5,"Induction therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) generally comprises intensive combination chemotherapy, aimed at achieving a complete response (CR) by rapidly reducing the number of leukemia cells and restoring normal bone marrow function . Post-remission therapy, including chemotherapy, targeted therapies and autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) may be given to sustain the CR and achieve long-term disease-free survival . Intensive anthracycline/cytarabine (Ara-C)-based induction therapy constitutes the standard of care for most patients with AML . Exceptions are patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) for whom disease-specific treatments, such as all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic trioxide, are required, and frail or elderly patients in poor health who may require lower-intensity regimens (see below) . These regimens usually entail hospitalization for at least 4 weeks while blood cell counts recover to normal, and complications of the disease and its treatment are managed (see Chapter 6) . In some centers, the initial response to treatment is evaluated with a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy 7-10 days after completion of induction chemotherapy, in order to demonstrate adequate elimination of leukemia cells reflected by bone marrow hypoplasia . Treatment decisions in patients with AML who have relapsed after induction therapy are influenced by the likelihood of attaining CR, comorbid illnesses (including active infections), the patient's eligibility for allogeneic HSCT and the availability of an HLA-matched donor . the hyper-CVAD regimen (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide and intensive doses of Ara-C and methotrexate in combination with dexamethasone and vincristine), possibly augmented with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in patients who are positive for the Philadelphia chromosome, or rituximab in CD20-positive patients . TKI monotherapy may lead to CR rates of 90-100%, even in older patients, while a combination of standard chemotherapy and TKI treatment has led to longer disease-free survival in both adults and children . Although indefinite therapy with TKIs is usually advised for patients in chronic stable phase remission, some patients have been observed to stop treatment without recurrence of the disease, and several studies have investigated the effectiveness of stopping TKI treatment in patients who have had a sustained deep molecular response to these agents . There is a significant relapse rate in patients in blast crisis or accelerated phase even after successful treatment with TKIs, and it is appropriate to consider transplantation in such individuals . In contrast, patients with more advanced CLL, or those with symptoms or progressive disease, have a median survival without treatment between 18 months and 3 years . Treatment of the underlying CLL is indicated for patients who develop disease-related symptoms or evidence of progressive disease ('active disease'), and this can improve median survival to approximately 5-8 years . For example, alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, is approved for first-line treatment of CLL and as salvage therapy in patients with fludarabine-refractory disease . In most patients, durable remissions can be achieved, with long treatment-free periods followed by further therapy after symptomatic relapse . IFNalpha may be the preferred initial treatment in patients with severe pancytopenia and/or active infection, to improve blood counts and allow for subsequent therapy with purine analogs .","Induction therapy for most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises intensive anthracycline/cytarabine (Ara-C) combination chemotherapy aimed at achieving a complete response (CR). However, almost all patients who achieve a CR after induction therapy will ultimately relapse without post-remission therapy. Post-remission therapy for AML, comprising one or more courses of chemotherapy, or autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), is given to eliminate any residual disease and achieve a cure. The ideal donor for HSCT is a sibling with complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching. Unrelated donors who are a good match or related donors with some matching may also be suitable, but the risk of graft-versus-host disease is increased. Treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comprises chemotherapeutic induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy with central nervous system prophylaxis. Treatment options for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) include disease control with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or palliative therapy with cytotoxic agents and, less commonly, HSCT. TKIs are the initial treatment of choice for almost all patients with newly diagnosed CML. Treatment decisions for patients with CML depend on the phase of the disease, response to TKI treatment, age and eligibility for HSCT. The standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is observation rather than immediate treatment. Treatment is indicated for patients with more advanced or symptomatic disease to ameliorate symptoms and improve survival."
9781910797297,chp3,"Overall, the majority of clonal lymphocytes leading to various cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) have an alpha/beta phenotype; however, certain, usually clinically aggressive, CTCLs have a gamma/δ phenotype . A number of recent studies support immunophenotyping even in early disease to assist in the understanding of treatment-specific options . While some of the pathophysiology of mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) overlaps, it has now been shown that the T-cell subsets for these two diseases are distinct,, resulting in treatment-specific outcomes . Conversely, CCR4 and cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) are strongly expressed, which is a phenotype of skin-homing resident effector memory T cells . Early patch-stage disease is most often composed of a patchy lichenoid dermal infiltrate, lymphocytes tagging along the dermal-epidermal junction, basal layer lymphocytes with perinuclear halos and fibrosis of the papillary dermis (Figures 3.4 - 3.6) . Caution must be taken to avoid overcalling epidermotropic lymphocytes in areas of spongiosis, which is a common finding in inflammatory diseases . Tumor-stage disease is characterized by a dense, nodular to diffuse, dermal lymphocytic infiltrate that can extend into the subcutis (Figure 3.10) . The characteristic epidermotropic infiltrate seen in the patch and plaque stage of the disease (see Figure 3.2) may or may not be present in the folliculotropic variant . Pagetoid reticulosis strongly warrants clinicopathological correlation, as the histological findings described above are also seen in the indolent disorder lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), type D, and the clinically aggressive diseases cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma, cutaneous gamma/δ T-cell lymphoma and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type . Testing for HIV and human T-cell lymphocytic virus 1 (HTLV-1) should be considered if the patient is from an endemic area, has notable risk factors or has a clinical presentation of erythroderma . In early patch-stage disease, a clinical assessment of body surface area and lymph node examination is generally all that is needed for staging (see Chapter 5) . In early patch-stage disease, the histology results and clinical presentation will determine whether a subsequent systemic work-up should be performed . Although the histopathology in SS can be similar to that of MF, there is often less of, or even a lack of, epidermotropism and less lymphocytic infiltrate, which makes the diagnosis even more challenging (Figures 3.22 and 3.23) . Besides a clinical examination, this should include CBC, Sézary cell count, LDH, CT or PET-CT, flow cytometry, T-cell receptor polymerase chain reaction (TCR PCR) (see below), lymph node biopsy and, if necessary, a bone marrow biopsy . Flow cytometry is also a beneficial and commonly used test, not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring treatment response, including in patients enrolled in clinical trials . Up to 80-90% of cases of MF are shown to have clonal populations for beta and/or gamma genes (Figure 3.24), although this may only be 50-60% in early disease . Finding clonality on TCR PCR is particularly crucial to diagnosis and prognosis when determining if a lymph node has tumor involvement or whether it is dermatographic/reactive in nature .","With all cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), histopathology and clinical correlation is crucial in reaching the diagnosis. Malignant T cells in mycosis fungoides (MF) are derived from skin-homing resident effector memory T cells, while in Sézary syndrome (SS), the malignant cells are derived from central memory T cells. Both MF and SS usually display a CD3+, CD4+, CD7-, CD8- immunophenotype; however, CD8+ predominant cases of MF do exist. Histopathology of MF is characterized by small- to medium-sized T lymphocytes with epidermotropic cerebriform/pleomorphic nuclei, Pautrier's microabscesses, haloed lymphocytes along the dermal-epidermal junction and papillary dermal fibrosis. Tumor-stage MF has a more dense, diffuse and nodular infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes and can lack epidermotropism. Large cell transformation can occur in plaque- and tumor-stage disease. These cells are more than 4 times the size of a normal lymphocyte and must account for more than 25% of the atypical infiltrate. They can be either CD30+ or CD30-, with the latter leading to a poorer prognosis. Patients with early patch-stage MF generally do not need full systemic work-up; however, patients with plaque- and tumor-stage MF and SS need complete systemic work-up performed for staging. T-cell receptor polymerase chain reacton (TCR PCR) is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of MF, SS and other CTCLs. It is not 100% specific; however, in the correct clinical and histopathological setting it can be useful in determining monoclonality of the malignant lymphocytes. Matching clones identified from different samples are more useful in the diagnosis."
9781910797433,ch08,"There remain a number of unmet medical needs in the treatment of ovarian cancer, including improving cure rates and overcoming acquired resistance to platinum . Precision medicine has become a key strategy in ovarian cancer as a result of advances in a number of areas, including pharmacogenomics, bioinformatics and molecular biology (Figure 8.1) . Several different strategies have been advocated for targeted approaches to ovarian cancer, generally involving identification of a gene or protein that is overexpressed and can be reasonably targeted with acceptable toxicity (Figure 8.2) . The inter-relationship between PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutations offers a novel therapeutic strategy, whereby the simultaneous perturbation of two genes results in cell death: this is known as synthetic lethality . Strategies to increase the number of patients who would benefit from PARP inhibition have led investigators to examine the role of other genes that influence DNA repair in the homologous recombination pathway . In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, a number of other genes such as RAD51 and PALB2 have been shown to play a significant role in the development of ovarian cancer, as described in Chapter 3 . Four PARP inhibitors have been developed for use in ovarian cancer: olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib . Following an initial demonstration of good tolerability and potent efficacy, positive results were obtained in a Phase II comparison with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with germline BRCA mutations and recurrent disease, and a Phase II maintenance trial in patients with platinum-sensitive HGSC . Olaparib has received regulatory approval in the USA and Europe, as well as other parts of the world: depending on the region, it is indicated for later lines of therapy in patients with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, or as maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive disease . Recent Phase III data on maintenance therapy for platinum-sensitive disease have shown a significant advantage in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) for olaparib, compared with placebo (HR = 0.30) . As a result, niraparib has received regulatory approval in the USA for maintenance treatment of all women with recurrent ovarian cancer regardless of biomarker status . Veliparib is another highly selective PARP inhibitor that has been developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer . The largest trial in ovarian cancer with this compound is currently recruiting participants with newly diagnosed stage III or IV high-grade serous, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer to investigate the role of PARP inhibition with carboplatin and paclitaxel and as front-line continuation maintenance therapy . Current studies are investigating combinations of PARP inhibitors with anti-angiogenic therapies and immuno-oncologics (see below) . Initial single-agent activity has been demonstrated in recurrent ovarian cancer in both platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease: Table 8.1 details the various trials by line of therapy . It has been suggested that a combination of immune agents with PARP inhibitors might be beneficial, because tumor mutations and DNA alterations can generate neo-antigens that have been associated with an improved response to immune checkpoint therapies .","Precision medicine has become a key strategy in ovarian cancer. There is great hope that targeted therapies will offer improved outcomes. Targeted therapy generally involves identifying a gene or protein that is overexpressed in cancer and can be reasonably targeted with acceptable toxicity. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors - olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib - appear to be comparable in efficacy, but have differing toxicity profiles. Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is the most successful targeted therapy strategy in ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab has shown activity as a single agent in recurrent ovarian cancer in both platinum-sensitive and -resistant disease. A number of immuno-oncologic therapies, including inhibitors of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), have shown efficacy in various solid tumors and are under active development in ovarian cancer."
9781910797495,chp4,"Trigeminal neuralgia is an idiopathic paroxysmal recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal (fifth cranial) nerve (Figure 4.1) . Pain is usually caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal ganglion or its branches (Figure 4.2), but bony abnormalities or otherwise inapparent multiple sclerosis (MS) can also be associated with trigeminal neuralgia . Rarely, a space-occupying lesion (exempli gratia tumor) in the cerebellopontine angle can be a cause of trigeminal neuralgia, particularly if there is loss of sensation in trigeminal territory - sometimes called atypical trigeminal neuralgia . Compression of the peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve can also occur intraorally or in the region of the chin as the result of trauma, metastatic tumor or injury during alveolar or mandibular bone excision during tooth extraction . Therefore, although trigeminal neuralgia may have an initially inapparent peripheral origin, the clinical syndrome results from abnormal discharges within clusters of central neurons in the trigeminal nucleus and/or abnormal central processing of afferent neural impulses . Because there are no objective tests for trigeminal neuralgia, clinical manifestations are the mainstay of diagnosis . Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal and recurrent attacks of facial pain that are sudden and unilateral, and that follow the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve . Rarely, a combination of trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headache may occur (cluster tic syndrome) (see Chapter 12) . In addition, high-resolution MRI (exempli gratia three-dimensional fast-inflow MRI with steady-state precession) now enables a much more detailed study of the trigeminal nerve and its spatial relation with vascular structures such as a vascular loop (see Figure 4.2) . Lamotrigine, a sodium channel blocker, slowly titrated to reach 100-400 mg/day, may have an additional effect in patients who obtain insufficient relief with carbamazepine . Other options include the gabapentinoids (gabapentin or pregabalin), particularly in older people or in patients who are unable to tolerate carbamazepine . If medical management has failed and the patient can tolerate surgery, microvascular decompression of the trigeminal neural complex (also known as the Jannetta procedure) is the preferred treatment . Pain relief persists in more than 85% of patients at 5-year follow-up, with no risk of sensory loss . In older patients, percutaneous radiofrequency lesioning of the affected components of the trigeminal complex is the method of choice . This is a rapid and highly controllable procedure that aims to minimize risk of sensory loss . For non-responders and those in whom the pain relief is only temporary, a new or repeat procedure is sometimes performed . Patients who elect to undergo repeat procedures should be informed of the increased risks . Because of the severity and unpredictability of episodes of trigeminal neuralgia, patients with ineffective treatment pain are at increased risk of suicide . The authors of this text have treated many patients with trigeminal neuralgia who fail to respond to medical management or who have unacceptable side effects . Such patients must be given access to the invasive procedures described above, particularly microvascular decompression (MVD), in view of the high success rate .","Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysmal and recurrent attacks of facial pain that are sudden and unilateral, and follow the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Pain is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal ganglion or its branches. Medical management remains the first line of treatment. Carbamazepine, traditionally the drug of choice, is often replaced by gabapentin and pregabalin because of fewer side effects. Patients hospitalized because of the severity of pain may be effectively controlled by use of a subcutaneous infusion of lidocaine (lignocaine). Failed medical treatment is an indication for consideration of microvascular decompression or alternative techniques."
9781908541994,ch04,"Acne often occurs at an age when an individual is experiencing significant psychological and social changes . It is therefore not surprising that acne often leads to loss of self-esteem, anxiety, problems mixing with peers and, at times, significant depression . In some studies of patients with severe acne, the levels of social, psychological and emotional problems were as great as those reported by patients with conditions such as chronic disabling asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, back pain or arthritis . Depression and suicidal ideation have been studied in patients with a variety of skin conditions, including acne . For many patients, the psychological and social effects of acne motivate them to seek professional consultation and treatment . However, patients' parents or physicians do not always fully appreciate the psychosocial effects of the condition, which is frequently dismissed as merely a cosmetic problem . Health professionals need to be aware of the significant variation in the degree of psychological distress that acne causes in different people and to appreciate the differences in patients' coping skills . Clinicians may be dismissive about a mild case of acne, yet the patient may exhibit significant psychopathology . In fact, many studies have shown that a patient's dissatisfaction with their facial appearance significantly correlates with their own rating of acne severity, rather than the rating determined by their clinician . Several simple generic and dermatology-specific questionnaires are available to better understand the psychosocial effect of acne on the patient's life and wellbeing . Quality of life (QoL) measures help to identify patients vulnerable to psychological complications by capturing the complete effect of acne and treatment on the patient's life . Acne scarring (see pages 22-3) can cause significant disfigurement and correlates with psychological problems; it is also very difficult to treat . Several studies in patients with acne before and after treatment have documented improvements in a wide variety of psychological functions as a result of successful treatment . In many patients, the psychosocial disability caused by acne can be reversed with effective treatment . In the UK, the patient support group Changing Faces can be helpful for those suffering from psychological and social changes as a result of facial acne (see Useful resources, pages 100-1) . Acne as a symptom of other psychological disorders . A small number of patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) have acne as their prime dysmorphic symptom . Patients with BDD require significant support and expert dermatological and psychiatric management, as many have global mental disorders . Acne excoriée is a self-inflicted skin condition in which the affected individual compulsively picks real or imagined acne lesions, predominantly on the face (Figure 4.2) . A personality or psychological problem, such as OCD or body-focused anxiety, frequently underlies the condition . Treatment can be difficult depending on whether the patient has primary acne lesions or not . If active acne is evident, treatment should be employed to reduce the lesions . Some patients with acne excoriée may just need to break the habit of picking, whilst others may have a compulsive skin picking disorder that requires psychological therapy or psychotropic drug treatments .","Acne and scarring can cause significant psychosocial disability. Psychological changes should be noted, assessed and taken into account when managing acne. Perception studies have identified that people with acne and/or scarring are perceived more negatively. Validated and recognized questionnaires are available to assess the psychological disability caused by acne. A small number of patients with body dysmorphic disorder have acne as their prime dysmorphic symptom. The acne in these patients is usually mild or non-existent and the patient's complaint does not correlate with the physical signs. Acne excoriée may be alleviated by psychotropic drug treatments, psychological therapy, hypnosis or habit reversal therapy. Acne may be associated with anorexia nervosa."
9781912776238,ch11,"Experience in the European Union built up over the last 13 years indicates that even with one regulator and the support of the European Council, biosimilar uptake can vary dramatically between different countries and health systems . understanding the 'big data' from real-world use in Europe, with more than 50 biosimilars approved over 13 years and more than 700 million patient-days' exposure in health systems linked with sensitive pharmacovigilance systems and clinical outcomes monitoring . In England, the National Health Service (NHS) has achieved 50% switching rates for cancer therapeutic biosimilars in less than 6 months: this was achieved by investing in a program called the NHS Cancer Vanguard, in which health professionals provided physician and patient support throughout . Funding of health professional salaries for the program came as a gainshare agreement, through which the potential gains from biosimilar cost-savings were shared between payers and providers . As with the Norwegian model, each hospital's switching program was supported with clinical monitoring before and after switching, together with patient satisfaction surveys, while supportive education was provided from a central source . The European Council, in collaboration with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has worked to improve understanding of biosimilars in the EU through shared patient and health professional education . The EMA also now publishes a public-friendly summary of each European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains why each biosimilar medicine brand has been approved for use in Europe . The European Specialist Nurses Organisation has also produced an excellent nurse-led biosimilar switching program; it covers challenging questions that patients might ask, such as 'the biosimilar is cheaper - doesn't that mean it's not as good?' and provides evidence-based model answers . This is supported with a Biosimilars Stakeholder Toolkit, with a variety of patient and prescriber outreach materials, including fact sheets, videos and graphics, as well as drop-in content for web pages to help promote understanding of biosimilars . The Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE) explored drivers of biosimilar uptake and reported that approximately half of European countries have incentives for physicians to prescribe biosimilars . When that is the case, the PBM [pharmacy benefit manager] adds the drug with the lowest net cost - that is, the manufacturer-set price minus the rebate or discount - and removes higher-cost clinically equivalent drugs within the same therapeutic class from the formulary . One key legal challenge claims that an originator producer has withheld or threatened to withhold rebates if payers do not list the reference drug in an exclusive preferred position over biosimilars . Promotions for novel originator medicines are usually based on claims of superiority arising from differences in clinical trial outcomes, such as a longer time without tumor or disease progression, higher 5-year overall survival rates or lower drug toxicity . They are tailored for each drug and use sensitive patient populations and trial endpoints that may be different from the originator's pivotal study . Different clinical trial designs may therefore offer the only opportunity for drug manufacturers to make claims of superiority of one trial approach over another that are of no interest to the regulator .","Health professionals and patients need support to understand the issues around biosimilars and to feel confident using them. Many different support materials are available to help health professionals talk to colleagues and patients about biosimilars. Around half of European countries have incentives for physicians to prescribe biosimilars. The regulatory requirements for biosimilars mean that it may not be possible to compare a biosimilar with the originator or with other biosimilars. In this scenario, formulary decisions are driven by price and convenience.

9781908541796,chapter7,"Most T-cell lymphomas are aggressive except for the primary cutaneous forms, such as mycosis fungoides, which can have a protracted and indolent course if they remain localized to the skin . Tumors derived from natural killer (NK) cells are very rare and tend to present in the nose and adjacent structures, though occasionally they can present as a frank leukemia . The clinical behavior of this disease is very similar to precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and it typically presents as a large mediastinal mass . There is some evidence to support the use of high-dose therapy with stem-cell rescue in patients with LBL following consolidation, rather than proceeding to maintenance treatment . Large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia is one of the few T-cell disorders that typically behaves in an indolent fashion . The disorder is characterized by the presence of increased numbers of large granular lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, autoimmune features (often rheumatoid arthritis) and neutropenia . Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) is an aggressive lymphoma associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection seen in patients of Afro-Caribbean, Japanese or Southeast Asian origin, where this virus is endemic . Patients are usually middle-aged and present with widespread lymphadenopathy, enlargement of the liver and spleen, and often skin involvement . In most cases, there is involvement of the peripheral blood and bone marrow, and occasionally the white cell count may be extremely high . Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified, is a rare, clinically aggressive lymphoma with a poor prognosis (Table 7.3) . Most patients are middle-aged or elderly and typically present with widespread, often relatively small-volume, lymphadenopathy with marked systemic symptoms, particularly fever and weight loss . In many patients, however, disease progression occurs during treatment, and salvage chemotherapy proceeding to high-dose therapy is required . Some centers treat peripheral T-cell lymphomas with high-dose therapy as part of first-line treatment in view of the poor prognosis . Some data suggest that chemotherapy regimens that include drugs such as etoposide or gemcitabine are more effective in the first-line treatment of this condition, and clinical trials are in progress to assess these combinations as well as the inclusion of some newer T-cell 'specific' drugs such as pralatrexate and romidepsin . The localized cutaneous anaplastic large-cell tumor does not usually express translocated ALK . ALK-positive lymphomas tend to occur in younger patients, produce systemic rather than isolated cutaneous disease, and are generally very chemoresponsive . The tumor may present as lymphadenopathy (which is sometimes surprisingly bulky), bone lesions or occasionally with peripheral blood involvement in which case the prognosis is usually poor . Systemic anaplastic lymphoma that does not express translocated ALK (ALK-negative) has a less favorable prognosis than ALK-positive disease, and often progresses during chemotherapy, or relapses soon after the completion of treatment . Angio-immunoblastic lymphoma is a rare T-cell lymphoma that presents with some well-recognized clinical features together with a complicated histological appearance (Table 7.5) . Enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma characteristically presents with features of small-bowel disease, such as perforation, obstruction, bleeding or malabsorption . Some patients present with systemic involvement, sometimes with circulating malignant cells in the peripheral blood, and skin involvement .","T-cell lymphomas comprise only 5% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases in Western countries. T-cell lymphomas often involve the skin. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas present with widespread small-volume lymphadenopathy, but with marked systemic symptoms. Most T-cell lymphomas are aggressive and often progress during treatment."
9781908541406,ch_4,"The assessment of an individual patient is a two-stage process, comprising: history and focused clinical examination; and laboratory investigation . Laboratory investigation of the patient's blood involves screening tests, measuring the concentration of specific clotting factors and assessing platelet function . A full general medical history and examination should be undertaken, and the bleeding symptoms recorded in the context of the patient's overall health and lifestyle . Bruising, purpura, prolonged bleeding from superficial cuts, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding and menorrhagia often reflect failure of the primary hemostatic system (as with a platelet abnormality or von Willebrand disease) . Bleeding symptoms over a long period of time suggest a lifelong congenital bleeding disorder, while those of recent origin may be more in keeping with an acquired medical disorder (exempli gratia liver disease) . Difficulties may arise in individuals with mild congenital bleeding disorders who only bleed after surgery and who may, therefore, remain undiagnosed until adulthood, especially now that circumcision, tonsillectomy and dental extractions are performed less often in childhood . A positive family history of a bleeding disorder can be helpful in directing investigations (exempli gratia hemophilia) . Any child presenting with unexpected bleeding should be carefully and immediately assessed, especially in relation to any family history of a bleeding disorder or if the clinical circumstances suggest the possibility of non-accidental injury . To date, bleeding scores have mainly been research tools but some, such as the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis Bleeding Assessment Tool (ISTH-BAT), are being validated for clinical use . The extent of the investigations will depend on the likelihood of the patient having a bleeding disorder as determined by the history and physical examination . Once a full history and the results of the physical examination have been obtained, it should be possible to assess whether or not the patient has a bleeding disorder, whether it is severe or mild and whether the patient has a disorder of primary hemostasis (exempli gratia von Willebrand disease or a platelet disorder) or of secondary hemostasis (exempli gratia hemophilia or other coagulation disorder) . If the history is not particularly suggestive of a bleeding disorder, these investigations may be sufficient (and will exclude most severe bleeding disorders) . On the other hand, if the patient has a very convincing history but normal screening tests, it would be appropriate to consider measuring levels of the individual coagulation factors, usually beginning with FVIII and von Willebrand factor (VWF), as hemophilia A and von Willebrand disease are the most common congenital bleeding disorders (Table 2.1) . It reliably reflects the effects of ASA (aspirin) on platelet function, but may be normal in patients with mild hemostatic defects; therefore, a normal test should not be used to exclude platelet function defects in individuals with a positive bleeding history . These screening tests are only prolonged when a clotting factor is reduced to below about 25% of normal levels; therefore, if there is a high clinical suspicion of a mild bleeding disorder, the levels of individual coagulation factors must be measured .","A full and detailed history of personal and family bleeding symptoms often indicates the nature and severity of a potential bleeding diathesis. All current and recent drugs should be reviewed as possible causes of a bleeding state. Specific inquiry should be made about oral anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists, or inhibitors of thrombin or factor (F)Xa or other antithrombotic therapy (exempli gratia acetylsalicylic acid [ASA, aspirin]). Defects of primary hemostasis (id est platelet disorders and von Willebrand disease) present with mucosal bleeding (exempli gratia epistaxis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and menorrhagia). Defects of secondary hemostasis (id est coagulation disorders such as hemophilia) usually present with hemarthroses and muscle hematoma."
9781908541796,chapter4,"Bone-marrow biopsy and aspirate are a standard staging investigation for most types of lymphoma . There are certain situations, such as low-risk early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma, where the routine use of bone-marrow biopsy is not recommended as the likelihood of bone involvement is so low . Studies have suggested that patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma who have extensive disease on CT/PET do not need to undergo bone-marrow biopsy as its result does not influence subsequent management . From the results of imaging and bone-marrow biopsy, the lymphoma can be staged by the Ann Arbor system as follows (Figure 4.3) . Once the diagnosis is established and the staging investigations are completed, the patient and relatives need to be fully informed of the nature of the condition and the likely treatment plan . As lymphomas are spread by the bloodstream and by lymphatic drainage at an early stage, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and, increasingly, targeted therapies are the mainstay of treatment . Combination chemotherapy generally improves the response rate compared with single-agent treatment . R-CHOP, as the combination of rituximab and CHOP chemotherapy has become known, saves one additional life for every ten patients treated compared with CHOP alone and has now become the standard of care for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) . However, there is extensive evidence to show that the survival for patients with indolent lymphomas has improved in the last two decades, possibly because of the introduction of monoclonal antibody therapy . Single-agent oral chemotherapy, for example with an alkylating agent, can be effective in inducing a partial response and thereby improves the patient's symptoms and general wellbeing . Like most lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphomas are radiosensitive, so radiotherapy can be useful when the disease is localized (stages IA and IIA), although it is usually given in combination with chemotherapy . Advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (stages IIB-IV) must be treated with combination chemotherapy . Modern therapeutic regimens aim to reduce the exposure of patients with early-stage disease to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy by using abbreviated treatment programs and attempting to eliminate radiotherapy altogether . A very important aspect of the delivery of chemotherapy is the likely effect on the patient's normal blood count . The response to chemotherapy determines the subsequent management of the patient . The most recent response criteria adopted for lymphomas include the use of functional imaging, with PET scans for patients in clinical trials . One of the central dilemmas of lymphoma management is the interpretation of residual masses following chemotherapy (Figure 4.4) . Indeed, 60% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma are found to have residual masses on completion of chemotherapy . PET scanning may help identify those masses that contain active lymphoma and therefore require more therapy; the technique is, however, still being evaluated and is not 100% reliable . Patients who relapse after initial therapy will usually be given a different chemotherapy regimen . In this situation, patients will usually be offered platinum-based chemotherapy (see pages 55 and) followed by high-dose therapy and stem-cell rescue . For indolent lymphomas, relapse may or may not require active therapy .","Extranodal lymphomas must be monitored during and after treatment to assess response to therapy. Staging is mandatory in the management of lymphoma. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is a valuable staging investigation for patients with many subtypes of lymphoma. When staging investigations have been completed, the patient and relatives must be fully informed of the nature of the condition and the likely treatment plan, and given opportunities to ask questions. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of management. Neutropenic sepsis is a life-threatening complication of chemotherapy and requires urgent assessment. Fertility is an important consideration in any patient of childbearing age receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients who relapse should be considered for re-biopsy and complete restaging."
9781908541727,ch10,"In some ways, children's eye problems may have greater consequences than eye problems in adults, because some conditions, if neglected, may cause amblyopia ('lazy eye') which can reduce the vision in one or both eyes for the whole of the patient's life . In addition, life-threatening problems such as eye or brain tumors can, rarely, present with a squint ('turned eye'), poor red reflex or poor vision in an infant or child . an infant with persisting eye watering or a slight sticky discharge from one or both eyes, with no eye redness, photophobia or corneal clouding or enlargement (likely to be congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction) . Most infants and children with 'watery' eyes have harmless congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction; however, be careful not to miss the rare sight-threatening condition of congenital glaucoma, and the sight- and life-threatening disease ophthalmia neonatorum . In contrast with viral or bacterial conjunctivitis in children or adults, in whom the disease is annoying but rarely dangerous; conjunctivitis within the first few weeks of life (ophthalmia neonatorum) may be the first sign of a sight- or life-threatening systemic infection due to a sexually transmitted disease that the infant acquired during delivery . Young children are unable to complain of poor vision themselves, but parents may notice that their child is not looking at them or reacting to their facial expressions, or is having problems navigating and bumps into furniture . Poor vision in one or both eyes may also present with a noticeable squint or nystagmus (see below) . A critical difference between childhood and adult vision is that children less than 9 years old with poor vision in one or both eyes from any cause, or one eye constantly turned from squint, will not develop normal connections between the affected eye/s and the developing visual cortex . If, however, the cause of poor vision (exempli gratia congenital cataract) is identified and treated urgently, permanent blindness from amblyopia may be prevented . The earlier a child with poor vision in one or both eyes is referred to an ophthalmologist, the better the chance of preventing permanent visual loss . A red reflex test should be performed on any child with a squint, apparently poor vision or any other eye problem . Poor vision itself (including serious causes such as malignant retinoblastoma in one or both eyes, or congenital cataracts) can cause squint . Conversely, squint can cause poor vision, because an eye that is constantly turned will develop amblyopia . Children with squints usually do not (if they are old enough to talk) complain of double vision, because their brain 'switches off' the image from the deviated eye . Children can develop squint from all the same causes as adults, including third, fourth or sixth nerve palsies from brain tumor, inflammation or infection . Children who are born bilaterally blind, or who develop blindness within the first few months of life (exempli gratia from untreated congenital cataract or anterior visual pathway tumor such a glioma), often develop constant movement of both eyes .","Refer urgently, to be seen the same day, if your patient is:- a neonate with red eyes and eye watering or discharge (possible ophthalmia neonatorum)- a neonate or child with an abnormal red reflex (possible retinoblastoma or congenital cataract)- an infant or child with photophobia, constant tearing (epiphora), corneal enlargement or cloudy cornea (possible congenital glaucoma)- a child with red eye with pain, photophobia or blurred vision (possible corneal ulcer, iritis or endophthalmitis)- an older child with double vision (causes include brain tumor or aneurysm)- a child of any age with swollen optic disc/s on ophthalmoscopy (possible brain tumor or hydrocephalus).- an infant or child with preseptal or orbital cellulitis- an infant or child with ptosis- an infant or child with a history of eye trauma or possible shaken baby syndrome.

9783318066241,ch9,"9 Preventing recurrence and monitoring for late complications after acute pancreatitis . The etiology for most patients will be diagnosed during their index hospital admission by means of anamnesis (to determine possible drug, alcohol and tobacco abuse, etc . Patients with an obscure etiology should undergo endoscopic ultrasonography, which can accurately diagnose gallbladder microlithiasis/sludge and pancreatic solid and cystic tumors . In affected patients, cholecystectomy is indicated after an episode of AP to prevent recurrence of these other complications of gallstone disease . In patients with mild AP, many observational studies have reported a high risk of recurrence associated with a delay in cholecystectomny . The primary endpoint was a composite variable: readmission for recurrent gallstone-related complications (pancreatitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis needing endoscopic intervention, or gallstone colic) or mortality within 6 months after randomization . The primary endpoint occurred in 5% (same-admission) versus 17% (interval cholecystectomy) of patients (p = 0.002) while a recurrence of AP occurred in 2% versus 9% of patients (p = 0.03); there were no differences in surgical complications . Endoscopic sphincterotomy is useful in preventing recurrence of gallstone AP but cholecystectomy is recommended afterwards, if it is not contraindicated by comorbidity, to avoid future episodes of pain and cholecystitis . Any decision to perform an endoscopic sphincterotomy before delayed cholecystectomy and the subsequent timing for cholecystectomy in such patients should be made on an individual case basis . Avoidance of alcohol is associated with a lower rate of recurrent AP and progression to chronic pancreatitis . An RCT comparing one brief intervention to stop alcohol intake during hospital admission versus repeated interventions every 6 months for 2 years found that although the total number of episodes of subsequent AP was lower in the repeated intervention group, the proportion of patients experiencing at least one or two recurrences did not differ between the groups . According to a retrospective study, triglyceride levels greater than 200 mg/dL are associated with a higher frequency of recurrent AP after an episode of hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP . Some patients will experience significant late complications following an episode of AP, including . Risk factors for diabetes are severe AP (39%), necrotizing AP (37%) and alcohol-related AP (28% vs only 12% in gallstone-associated AP) . A systematic review showed a pooled prevalence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) subsequent to AP of 62% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39%, 82%), decreasing during follow-up to 35% (95%CI 27%, 43%) . Ten percent of patients with a first episode of AP will develop chronic pancreatitis, including 36% of cases with recurrent AP, 65% of cases with an alcohol-related etiology and 61% of tobacco-related AP cases, compared with only 9% in biliary AP . Chronic pancreatitis is a very heterogeneous disease that may be associated with episodic or chronic abdominal pain, diabetes, EPI and other complications such as pseudocysts, pseudoaneurysms, biliary and duodenal strictures, osteoporosis, etc . The detection and treatment or avoidance of etiologic factors for AP is the cornerstone of preventing recurrent and chronic pancreatitis and a holistic approach has been proposed to avoid progression .","The correct diagnosis of the etiology of acute pancreatitis (AP) is important to prevent recurrence. Endoscopic ultrasonography is very useful in patients with an obscure etiology after anamnesis, laboratory findings and conventional ultrasonography. Diabetes, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, recurrence and progression to chronic pancreatitis are frequent consequences of AP."
9781905832729,ch_8,"Asymptomatic bacteriuria refers to the finding of a significant number of bacteria in the urine of a patient but without any of the symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI) . The prevalence varies from 5% of premenopausal women to more than 15% in the elderly; almost 100% of patients with a long-term (longer than 30 days) indwelling urinary catheter are affected . Because of the increasing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics, it is important to rationalize treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria . Tests performed can include an estimation of postvoid residual urine volume, outpatient cystoscopy and imaging of the upper urinary tract, usually with ultrasonography and plain radiography, looking for calculi, evidence of reflux and cortical scarring . However, such investigations will prove negative in the majority of patients, and a degree of clinical discretion is required to prevent the expense and distress caused by overinvestigation, particularly in young women in whom concurrent pathology is unlikely . Antibiotic treatment is recommended for patients with recurrent UTIs . A continuous regimen of low-dose antibiotics can be used as prophylaxis against further infections in selected patients . At low doses, an adequate concentration of antibiotic will be achieved in the urine but with little effect on the fecal and vaginal flora, thereby preventing the development of resistant strains and complications related to the reduction of normal flora, such as genital Candida spp . Patients are provided with 3 days' full-dose antibiotic treatment to take when they experience the symptoms of acute cystitis; the symptoms of UTIs can be accurately identified by 85% of women . Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) and interstitial cystitis (IC) are described in the American Urological Association IC/BPS guideline as a condition in which a patient experiences an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than 6 weeks' duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes . The diagnosis of IC is confined to patients with painful bladder symptoms who have characteristic cystoscopic and histological features . The diagnosis of BPS/IC is based clinically on symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency and pain . Diagnosis of BPS or IC requires the exclusion of other causes of the bladder symptoms, such as infection, malignancy, radiation or drug-induced cystitis . Some clinicians will diagnose IC in a patient who has a 3-month history of urinary urgency and frequency, bladder pain relieved by voiding and a negative urinary culture and cytology, whereas others will diagnose the condition only if the characteristic cystoscopic findings are present, preferably with histological confirmation . However, patients who present with BPS/IC should receive behavior modification treatment, as described in Table 7.4 . Modifying certain behaviors can improve symptoms in some IC/BPS patients and can reduce the frequency of voiding . It has been used in the treatment of BPS/IC and is useful in the management of pain at a titrated dose of up to 75 mg daily . It may be helpful for the symptoms of urgency and frequency but does not appear to improve pain associated with BPS/IC .","Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as a further UTI after resolution of initial bacteriuria. At least 20-30% of women will have a UTI at some time, 25% of whom will develop recurrent UTI. UTIs are relatively rare in men and are more likely to have a significant cause than in women. Urinalysis is quick and easy. A positive test should be followed up by microscopy, and the urine cultured to determine antimicrobial sensitivity. Treatment of UTIs is largely on the basis of symptoms and any underlying identified cause. Antibiotic treatment is recommended for recurrent UTI; prophylactic antibiotics and self-medication should also be considered. Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is characterized by suprapubic pain relating to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms such as frequency, in the absence of a proven UTI or other pathology. The diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) is confined to patients with bladder pain symptoms with characteristic cytoscopic and histological features. The etiology of BPS/IC is largely unknown. The roles of cystoscopy and bladder biopsy in the diagnosis of BPS/IC are controversial. Management of BPS/IC is largely conservative, and includes dietary advice, behavioral therapies, and oral and intravesical medication."
9781910797662,ch05,"Treatment is based on a risk-stratified approach that takes into account multiple prognostic factors associated with a risk of recurrence and progression to muscle-invasive disease . The standard of care for patients with T1 high-grade (HG) disease, uniformly supported by all the guidelines, is repeat resection, in order to determine the completeness of the resection and to rule out a more deeply invasive cancer prior to determination of treatment . Initial reports suggested a similar association with reduction in recurrence risk but this was not confirmed by a large international trial, except in patients with low-risk disease . These prognostic factors individually and collectively affect the probability of recurrence and progression and are used to stratify patients into prognostic groups that drive decisions about appropriate treatment and follow-up . Patients are stratified into risk groups for progression, based on low grade to high grade or non-invasive to invasive cancer . Induction chemotherapy (intravesical therapy weekly for 6 weeks) is not indicated for patients with low-risk disease . Patients who develop a recurrence of similar stage and grade are classified as intermediate risk and have been shown to benefit from intravesical chemotherapy . Patients with multiple or recurrent low-grade Ta tumors are at intermediate risk of recurrence or progression . Patients who present with CIS and/or HG papillary tumors (Ta or T1) have an 80% risk of recurrence and progression rates of 40-70% . BCG is the standard of care; level-I evidence supports induction therapy weekly for 6 weeks, followed by maintenance treatment weekly for 3 weeks at months 3 and 6 and then at 6-month intervals to 3 years . Intravesical administration of chemotherapy and immunotherapeutic agents, delivered into the bladder via a urethral catheter (Figure 5.1), is the primary treatment modality for reducing the risk of recurrence and progression and eradicating CIS . Optimal treatment requires complete resection of all visible papillary disease (Ta and T1) before initiating intravesical therapy . Single-agent gemcitabine and docetaxel have demonstrated efficacy in disease that is refractory to initial treatment with other agents, and the two drugs have been used in combination effectively in patients with BCG-unresponsive disease, particularly CIS . Intravesical immunotherapy with BCG was first reported to decrease papillary tumor recurrence in 1976 . BCG immunotherapy is also highly effective in CIS: induction plus maintenance therapy results in complete remission of disease in up to 85% of patients . For this reason, BCG immunotherapy is generally used only for first-line treatment in patients with high-risk disease, and as a second-line therapy for patients with intermediate-risk disease that continues to recur after adequate intravesical chemotherapy . While BCG alone is the standard of care for patients with a first occurrence of a high-risk tumor, BCG in combination with interferon may be useful for patients with disease recurrence after an initial course of BCG . As late recurrence can occur, lifelong surveillance is recommended, particularly for patients with high-risk tumors . In the UK, patients who have had low- and intermediate-risk tumors are often discharged from follow-up after 10 years without recurrence .","Risk-adapted treatment is based on accurate determination of stage, grade, number of tumors and presence of carcinoma in situ, and stratified as primary versus recurrent disease. Tumors can be classified into low-, intermediate- and high-risk based on these factors; these risk strata drive treatment decisions and surveillance recommendations. Low-risk tumors may recur but are unlikely to progress. Peri-operative single-dose chemotherapy reduces recurrence, and patients may only need cystoscopic follow-up. Intermediate-risk tumors are more likely to recur and have a modest progression risk. A course of intravesical chemotherapy will reduce the risk of recurrence but not of progression. Optimized mitomycin treatment is associated with optimal outcomes. Induction with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) followed by maintenance for 1 year is also a standard of care. High-risk bladder cancer is likely to recur and, unless adequately treated, to progress. It is fatal in up to 30% of patients. Intravesical BCG induction plus maintenance for 3 years is standard of care. Radical cystectomy is indicated for patients with high-risk disease that is unresponsive to BCG, if the patient is medically fit and accepts the risks."
9781912776818,hh-5,"Although mild or moderate renal insufficiency can be seen in iTTP patients, the development of acute renal failure is rare and is more likely with other TMAs, particularly HUS . Causes of secondary TMAs include severe infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, HIV infection, drug toxicity (especially in people with cancer or following solid-organ transplant) and, rarely, autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) . Patients usually develop abdominal pain, diarrhea (often bloody), followed by an acute TMA and renal injury within 5-13 days after the onset of diarrhea . Etiologies for aHUS include complement gene mutations (complement factor H [CFH] has the most common and most severe mutation) and antibodies to CFH that lead to an inability to control complement activation after it has been triggered for a normal physiological reason (for example, infection, pregnancy) . Presentation can be similar to that of STEC-HUS, with acute renal failure and acute TMA findings . Quinine works via an immune mechanism that induces severe TMA, mainly in women, and it occurs suddenly - within a few hours of ingestion - causing constitutional symptoms, rash and oliguric renal failure . The following may present with acute TMA findings and may need to be excluded clinically before a diagnosis of TTP or aHUS can be made . TMA may occur through a mixture of mechanisms, including drug toxicity from the immunosuppressing agents mentioned above, severe infections or, in the case of hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, graft-versus-host disease . A TMA associated with stem-cell transplant that is clinically similar to aHUS also occurs . While pregnancy can trigger disease onset in patients with cTTP, iTTP and aHUS, pregnancy has its own TMA differential diagnosis, which includes pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count), acute fatty liver of pregnancy, abruptio placenta, amniotic fluid embolism and retained products of conception . TMA can occur in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and progressive systemic sclerosis, particularly in association with acute scleroderma, renal crisis and malignant hypertension . A rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutation in MMACHC, the gene encoding methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C protein, results in developmental delay, neurological symptoms, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure and TMA . Many clinical features of TTP and HUS can be present in malignant hypertension, including MAHA, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency and neurological deficits . Anemia, thrombocytopenia and distorted red cells can be confused for a TMA process, though patients are usually diagnosed with sickle cell disease at an early age . HLH presents as a febrile illness associated with multiple organ involvement, splenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, coagulopathy and neurological abnormalities, which can mimic TTP . It is a clinical diagnosis that can be screened for using the 4 T scoring system (thrombocytopenia > 50%, platelet count decrease 5-10 days after heparin exposure, thrombosis and lack of other causes for thrombocytopenia) and confirmed by testing for heparin-associated antibodies . During early childhood, the differential diagnosis includes STEC-HUS, aHUS and secondary TMA associated with diseases of early childhood .","The thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are a group of disorders that share common clinical characteristics and findings, but with differing pathobiologies that lead to the TMA presentation. Individuals with hemolytic uremic syndrome and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome typically present with more severe renal injury or renal failure compared with individuals with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Quinine, ciclosporin and tacrolimus can induce TMAs via an immune-mediated mechanism (quinine) or dose-dependent toxicity. Systemic disorders that can secondarily present with TMA findings include disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis/infection and autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus). Diseases that present with significant thrombocytopenia mimicking a systemic TMA that should be considered in the differential diagnosis include myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anemia, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria."
9781908541406,ch_6,"Some disorders give rise to relatively mild bleeding symptoms, often with normal platelet counts, and the diagnosis may not be made until the patient is well into adult life, usually following excessive bleeding after surgery (exempli gratia dental extraction) or trauma . Patients with this syndrome have prolonged bleeding time, defective platelet adhesion and impaired platelet aggregation in response to ristocetin . The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with a history of bleeding and a reduced platelet count, and confirmed by reviewing platelet morphology and observing reduced ristocetin-induced aggregation, but normally functioning VWF . Patients have a normal platelet count, but greatly impaired clot retraction, and agents such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine (adrenaline) and collagen fail to induce platelet aggregation . Cyclooxygenase defects result in impaired platelet aggregation and release of ADP from dense granules in response to ADP and collagen, and are associated with a mild bleeding tendency . Inspection of the blood film will reveal whether the platelet count is normal (as in many mild platelet function disorders) or decreased, and if the appearance of the platelets or white cells is abnormal, exempli gratia large platelets and leukocyte Döhle bodies in the May-Hegglin anomaly (see Figure 2.3) . Determining the time of onset of the condition by asking whether the patient ever had a normal platelet count helps to exclude congenital thrombocytopenias . An acute decline in platelet count in a patient undergoing treatment for cardiac, rheumatologic or infectious disease suggests that a drug may be responsible . Thrombocytopenia accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (with fragmented red cells visible on the blood film) and evidence of thrombosis warrant a consideration of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic-uremic syndrome . In many patients, thrombocytopenia is discovered when a complete blood count is performed as part of a periodic health examination; however, others may notice a petechial rash or oral bleeding and consult their physician . A complete blood count indicates the severity of the thrombocytopenia; a concomitant hypochromic microcytic anemia may be present if bleeding has been chronic, but the leukocyte count is generally normal . The American Society of Hematology's 2011 evidence-based guidelines do not recommend a bone marrow examination in patients newly diagnosed with primary immune thrombocytopenia, provided the history and physical examination are unremarkable and the blood count shows only thrombocytopenia and/or findings of iron deficiency . In children, primary immune thrombocytopenia is usually an acute self-limiting condition and, provided there is no frank or persistent bleeding, drug therapy may not be necessary . Thrombotic microangiopathies include thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, hemolytic anemia with elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome in pregnancy and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia . It is usually a benign incidental finding, but it may be associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a manifestation of primary immune thrombocytopenia or a pseudothrombocytopenia due to platelet clumping in vitro . Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or HIV infection, but spontaneous bleeding is rare, even if the platelet count is severely depressed . prevent bleeding in patients with platelet counts of less than 10 x 10 /L and impaired platelet production due to .","Thrombocytopenia may occur with some inherited disorders of platelet function, such as the Bernard-Soulier, gray platelet and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes. Inhibitors of platelet function, such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), should be avoided in individuals with disorders of platelet function and those with thrombocytopenia. In immune thrombocytopenia, bleeding is uncommon if the platelet count exceeds 10 x 10 /L and aggressive interventions (exempli gratia high-dose corticosteroids, splenectomy) are not usually indicated. Gestational thrombocytopenia is common and requires no treatment, but it must be distinguished from primary immune thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusion has limited indications and should be used sparingly, because it may transmit infection or sensitize the recipient to platelet antigens."
9781910797587,chp03,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder and represents a major cause of pain and disability for the individual, as well as resulting in enormous health expenditure in Western countries . In the USA, an estimated 30 million people are affected by the disorder, while in the UK some 8.75 million people aged 45 years or older sought treatment for OA between 2004 and 2010 . OA is a syndrome of joint pain and stiffness with associated functional problems, which can have a substantial effect on quality of life . The 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimated that 242 million people worldwide were affected by symptomatic OA of the hip and/or knee and that the global prevalence of hip and knee OA is approaching 5% . Studies on the distribution of radiographic OA have suggested that right-sided hand and knee OA is more common than left-sided disease (consistent with a biomechanical cause) . Individual joints demonstrate a striking age-related rise in the prevalence of radiographic OA . About one-third of all adults have radiographic OA of the hands, with two-thirds over 75 years of age exhibiting OA of the distal interphalangeal joints . The prevalence of radiographic OA (particularly of the hand and knee) is higher in women than men, especially in individuals over 50 years of age . Women report more pain than men: worldwide estimates suggest that 9.6% of men and 18.0% of women over 60 years of age have symptomatic OA . Many people have multiple joint pains: a study in individuals over the age of 55 suggested a median number of four painful joints (though not all will be OA) . So, while knee pain affects about a quarter of the adult population, the prevalence of a painful disabling knee attributable to OA in the UK population over 55 years of age has been estimated at approximately 10% . Statistics from the USA put the prevalence of a painful OA knee in adults over 45 years of age at 16% . Symptomatic hand OA has a reported prevalence of about 7% in a population-based study, in contrast to the high radiographic incidence, while other studies have suggested that 9.5% of adults in the USA have symptomatic hip OA . Between 2010 and 2012, the activities of approximately 22.7 million adults in the USA were reported to be limited as a result of arthritis; 61% of those affected were younger than 65 years of age . Studies have suggested that even after adjustment for age, sex and social class, people with OA are at least twice as likely to have comorbid conditions as the general population . Possible explanations for this excess mortality included reduced levels of physical activity among people with OA, the presence of comorbid conditions and adverse effects of medications used to treat symptomatic OA . The number of people in the UK with knee OA is expected to rise to 6.5 million by 2020, while in the USA, by 2030, an estimated 67 million adults aged 18 years or older are expected to have doctor-diagnosed arthritis, including OA .","For most people and clinicians, osteoarthritis (OA) refers to a clinical syndrome of joint pain, functional impairment and impaired quality of life. Although radiographic OA is common, it is not always symptomatic. Joint pain is common, increasingly so with age; individuals frequently have multiple joint pains. People with OA are more likely to have comorbid conditions than the general population and comorbidities can exacerbate the impact of OA on an individual. OA has a large impact on the individual and society."
9781908541024,ch_2,"Intracranial tumors can be classified in several different ways . The most fundamental differentiation is between primary intracranial lesions and metastatic tumors . Primary tumors can be further subdivided according to whether they arise from the brain parenchyma, meninges, pituitary region, pineal region or skull base . Neurological symptoms and neuroimaging provide information about tumor location, which is useful in developing a differential diagnosis (Table 1.1) . However, definitive diagnosis of primary brain tumors is based on the cell of origin and requires histopathological assessment . The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system is used widely (see Key references) . Most intracranial tumors arise from the brain parenchyma, primarily from glial cells (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes) . Primary neuronal tumors are uncommon . Meningeal tumors are the second most common type of intracranial tumor . Tumors also arise from a variety of other cell types, including some not ordinarily found in the brain (exempli gratia germ cells, lymphocytes and embryonic rests) (Figure 1.1) . Incidence and epidemiology . Brain metastases are much more common than primary intracranial tumors . Approximately 170000 people in the USA are diagnosed with brain metastases every year, while 62930 are diagnosed with a primary benign or malignant brain tumor . More than 13000 die each year as a result of a primary malignant brain tumor . In children and in men aged 20-39 years, brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the USA . Data from several studies suggest an increase in the incidence of both primary brain tumors, particularly primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, and brain metastases since the 1970s . This may be partly due to a true increase in incidence, but it is also a consequence of greater access to and improvements in neuroimaging techniques . Epidemiological studies of brain tumors are limited as a result of ascertainment bias, small sample size and retrospective design . The best data suggest an annual worldwide incidence for primary brain tumors of 3-4/100000 person-years . The incidence of primary brain tumors varies by sex, race, age and geography . Men have a higher risk than women of developing most brain tumors, with the exception of meningiomas . Similarly, brain tumors are more common in white than other ethnic groups, with the exception of meningiomas and pituitary adenomas . Brain tumors are more common in developed countries . Numerous other risk factors have been reported (Table 1.2) but the studies are generally small and their findings have not been confirmed . An increasing number of molecular genetic alterations have been described in association with particular primary brain tumors (Table 1.3) . In the majority of patients, it is likely that some combination of genetic and environmental factors leads to the development of a brain tumor . Developments in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics are resulting in an exponential increase in our knowledge about all types of brain tumors, and should lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies . Classification and epidemiology .","Primary brain tumors and metastases have been diagnosed with increasing frequency over recent decades. This may reflect a true increase in incidence, but improved neuroimaging techniques and greater access to imaging account for part of this increase. Environmental risk factors for the development of brain tumors are poorly understood and are probably over-reported. Developments in molecular biology, genomics and proteomics are resulting in an exponential increase in our knowledge about all types of brain tumors."
9781908541963,chapter7,"Chronic infection with the hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) virus is the most common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide (Table 7.1) . In the past, the HBeAg/'e' antibody (HBeAb) status was used to determine whether individuals had active viral replication . Seroconversion from HBeAg to HBeAb may cause hepatitis-like symptoms; patients come to clinical attention during this process . The spectrum of liver disease associated with chronic hepatitis B includes . Many patients with chronic hepatitis do not develop significant liver disease during their lifetime . Once cirrhosis develops, 85% of patients remain stable for a further 5 years, but the risk of developing symptoms of liver failure increases significantly thereafter . An expanding number of nucleoside and nucleotide analogs have become available that reliably reduce viral replication and lead to seroconversion to HBeAb in 30-60% of cases with treatment regimens of 3 years or longer . Liver decompensation associated with active viral replication has the potential to be dramatically reduced with effective suppression of viral replication, and patients apparently in need of liver transplantation can recover and defer the need for transplantation for many years . Passive immunoprophylaxis using hepatitis B immunoglobulin, possibly in combination with an oral agent, is successful in preventing reinfection of the liver in 80% or more cases where the HBV DNA is negative at the time of liver transplantation . In the absence of reinfection, the results of liver transplantation for hepatitis B are comparable to those for other patient subgroups . The acute infection is rarely clinically identified and, in most cases, the likely timing of infection can only be determined from an assessment of the risk factors for acquisition of the virus . Individuals are considered to have spontaneously cleared the virus if tests for HCV RNA are negative on three occasions over a period of at least 2 years . Infected individuals express a range of liver disease, ranging from mild hepatitis to cirrhosis . Once cirrhosis develops, the superimposed risk of developing HCC is in the order of 1-2% per patient-year . Given in combination with ribavirin for adults with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, it is the first all-oral interferon-free therapy . It can also be given in a triple combination with ribavirin and pegylated interferon for treatment-naive patients with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 . These advances are improving overall response rates and reducing the effect of genotype, stage of liver disease and previous responsiveness to interferon therapy on outcome . Liver disease associated with hepatitis C is now the most common indication for liver transplantation in most countries . Nevertheless, a proportion of patients who are HCV RNA negative at the time of transplantation following antiviral therapy do not develop recurrent infection . Developments in antiviral strategies are expected to be of special benefit to these patients, particularly the significant minority (20-30%) who were at risk of accelerated disease, with cirrhosis developing as early as 3-5 years after transplantation . As a result, the survival rate for hepatitis C was lower than for other indications 8 years and more after liver transplantation .","Hepatitis B and C virus are the most common causes of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Hepatitis B is preventable with vaccination and is treatable in 40-60% of cases. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it is treatable in up to 85% of cases with interferon-based regimens or the new oral therapy sofosbuvir. Liver transplantation may be required for end-stage chronic liver disease and small hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis C almost invariably recurred after liver transplantation and was problematic, but the availability of additional therapeutic options is likely to change this."
9781908541086,ch_9,"The treatment for bulimia involves a stepped care approach, starting with primary care and/or self-help programs; this is followed, as necessary, by hospital outpatient or day treatment, then inpatient treatment in a general psychiatry unit or, preferably, specialist unit-based therapies . Recent studies on the treatment of bulimia have demonstrated that, for adults, cognitive interventions and antidepressants, especially selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are effective . For the younger patients, family therapy may be indicated; ultimately, data indicate that intensive treatment modalities play an important role in any attempt at recovery . Cognitive-behavior therapy comprises four distinct phases for patients with bulimia . For example, a pilot study found that treatment of female patients (aged 14-17 years) with brief family therapy resulted in significant decreases in bulimic behavior at 1 year . This method may also help patients to deal more effectively with the feelings of shame commonly surrounding the disorder, as well as provide additional peer-based feedback and support . Some patients have found groups and programs such as Overeaters Anonymous to be helpful, in conjunction with initial treatments, for the prevention of relapses . The goal of therapy is to equip patients with the skills to respond to the maladaptive emotions that induce binge eating and purging with adaptive behaviors, such as mindfulness and deep breathing . Antidepressants have been used in the treatment of bulimia with encouraging results, and about 30% of patients benefit from pharmacotherapy alone . Fluoxetine is commonly used for the treatment of bulimia; it is approved for use in bulimic patients in the UK and it is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this eating disorder . In general, higher doses of SSRIs are used for the treatment of bulimia than for depression, with careful monitoring of side effects . In those, the increased risk for psychomotor activation and suicidal events potentially associated with the use of SSRIs needs to be taken into account when deciding to start or increase medication, and close monitoring is warranted throughout treatment . Numerous other agents have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of bulimia in double-blind placebo-controlled studies . Up to 70% of patients with bulimia benefit from a combination of medication and cognitive-behavior interventions . Studies have demonstrated that the symptoms of bingeing, purging and other attitudes related to eating disorders respond better to psychotherapy than to medication alone . In one study, CBT produced better results than treatment with fluoxetine, and although a combination intervention showed some benefit, there was a high rate of attrition . In another study, intensive group cognitive psychotherapy demonstrated greater efficacy than imipramine for the treatment of bingeing, purging and the symptoms of depression . Although the combination of the treatments did not incrementally improve 'eating variables' such as fear of gaining weight, body-image distortion, bingeing and purging, it did reduce depression and anxiety . For patients suffering from bulimia, the most common modes of treatment involve psychological therapy, medication or a combination of both .","The main goals of treatment for bulimia are abstinence from bingeing and purging, learning and maintaining healthy eating behaviors, and addressing any other psychological issues related to the condition. Psychological interventions are the mainstay of treatment; symptoms of bingeing and purging and other aspects of eating disorders respond better to psychotherapy than to medication alone. Up to 70% of patients benefit from a combination of cognitive-behavior techniques and pharmacotherapy. Higher doses of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are used for the treatment of bulimia than for depression, with careful monitoring of side effects. Fluoxetine is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bulimia; it is also licensed for this use in the UK. Regular moderate exercise may help patients to deal with the weight fluctuations that can be expected while their bodies adjust to new healthy eating patterns."
9781912776726,ch5,"Steroids can be prescribed, but patients should be made aware of the likely short-term adverse events, including raised glucose, thin skin, easy bruising, gastric irritation and the increased risk of infection . A systematic review of 42 observational studies involving 4089 patients with primary cerebral glioma (varying stages) reported a median frequency of depression at clinical interview of 15% (range 6-28%) . The risk of depression was not affected by sex or older age, or with tumor location, histology, grade or extent of resection . A retrospective study reported that almost 22% of 160 patients with glioblastoma took a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor during treatment for glioblastoma without affecting the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy or compromising survival . Seizures are often the first symptom of a brain tumor and are likely to be caused by elevated levels of N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) and -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) extracellular glutamate receptors, and the formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which resembles glutamate, in gliomas with IDH1 mutations . Localization of high-grade gliomas to the temporal lobe or cortex may also cause seizures . Surgical resection may induce seizures if, for example, the tumor is localized to the temporal lobe . Conversely, resection may reduce the incidence of seizures if they are being caused by edema or the mass effect of the tumor . In a retrospective analysis of 103 patients with glioblastoma, 22% (all with IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastoma) experienced seizures . Patients with seizures had smaller tumors, which caused less edema than non-epileptogenic tumors . Antiepileptic drugs are recommended for patients who present with seizures, but prophylactic use outside the perioperative phase is not advised . Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with intrinsic brain tumors, with an annual incidence of up to 20% . Risk factors include glioblastoma molecular subtype (exempli gratia patients with IDH1 -mutant glioblastoma have a lower incidence of VTE than those with an IDH wild-type tumor), paresis, neurological deficits, immobilization, surgery and steroid use . The risk of VTE is increased by a tumor-induced hypercoagulable state . As there is no evidence that anticoagulation therapy prevents VTE in these patients, prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended, but vigilance for suspicious indicatory symptoms is required . Steroids can be used to decrease tumor-associated edema and improve clinical symptoms . Physicians should make a clinical decision on the optimal starting dose of steroids after assessing the patient . Steroids are not indicated in the absence of edema-associated neurological deficits or if intracranial pressure is normal . Prolonged steroid use after resection is not recommended, and prophylaxis with steroids is not required during radiotherapy in asymptomatic patients . Prolonged exposure to steroids is not advised because of the potential for side effects . The dose of steroids should be tapered and discontinued where clinically appropriate . Monitoring of blood glucose during steroid therapy is advocated, given that in a retrospective study of 393 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide, a time-weighted mean glucose of 6.3 mmol/L was independently associated with longer overall survival (p > 0.005) .","Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in patients with glioblastoma. If the patient is fit enough, then light-to-moderate exercise or physical therapy should be encouraged. Short-term steroids may be useful, provided patients are warned of the potential short-term adverse effects. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors are suitable treatment for patients with depression during glioblastoma treatment. These drugs do not appear to affect the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy or compromise survival. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) can be used for the assessment of depression in patients with glioblastoma with the caveat that results may be skewed in patients with hemiparesis, hemianopia, hemisensory neglect or dysphagia. Although seizures are a common symptom in patients with glioblastoma, prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs outside the perioperative phase is not advised. First-generation antiepileptic drugs may interact with other medications; the preferred antiepileptic agents are lamotrigine, levetiracetam, pregabalin and valproic acid. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with intrinsic brain tumors. Glioma is not a contraindication to standard anticoagulation in patients with established thrombosis, but prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended. Instead, clinicians and patients need to be vigilant for any signs or symptoms of VTE. Steroid treatment (usually dexamethasone, 8-16 mg per day) will decrease tumor-associated edema and improve symptoms. Lower doses may be equally effective."
9781912776139,ch4,"These may be interpreted as potential ALS mimics simply because of the presence of prominent bulbar symptoms or mixed lower (LMN) and upper motor neuron (UMN) signs, but which occur independently of each other anatomically . Such cases tend to be those with a predominance of LMN or, more rarely, UMN clinical signs and often those with limited regional physical involvement (exempli gratia monomelic weakness) . Rather than taking a list-based approach to excluding every possible cause of progressive muscle weakness, the clinician should begin from a Bayesian logical position that conditions mimicking ALS, both in terms of symptom evolution (id est insidious) and clinical signs (id est LMN and UMN involvement), are extremely rare . The spinal imaging undertaken as part of the usual work up for all those with limb-onset forms of ALS typically shows more extensive clinical or electromyography (EMG)-based myotome involvement than may be plausibly explained by spondylotic changes in the spine . While the absence of sphincter or sensory involvement is still compatible with significant spondylosis, weakness of neck flexion is a strong pointer to the diagnosis of ALS, along with any bulbar signs or abnormal reflexes above the neck . The 'flail arm' LMN variant of ALS (see page 18) shows a strong male predominance (9:1) and typically presents with wasting and weakness around the shoulder, becoming gradually symmetric . Rare adult-onset variants with distal upper-, rather than lower-, limb involvement have been described; for example, GARS mutations (affecting glycyl tRNA synthetase), sometimes referred to as distal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type V . It is best reserved for the condition associated with inactivating mutations in the SMN1 gene, which typically begins in early childhood and is characterized by proximal limb weakness, tongue fasciculation and bulbar symptoms in the more severe cases . SMA type IV is a very rare adult-onset syndrome that presents with slowly progressive symmetric limb weakness with no involvement of the bulbar or respiratory muscles . The individual presenting with a slowly progressive LMN syndrome of weakness predominantly confined to a single limb is among the most challenging of diagnostic scenarios (Figure 4.4) . A useful clinical observation that distinguishes MMN from ALS in the early symptomatic period is 'weakness without marked wasting', although those with MMN may develop significant muscle wasting over years, as well as a more symmetric pattern of limb involvement . Over the following weeks the syndrome is characterized by patchy progressive weakness with variable wasting of muscles across multiple nerve root territories, typically without prominent sensory loss . Madras motor neuron disease (MMND) is a rare, typically very slowly progressive LMN syndrome associated with deafness, described in southern India . At present, a firm diagnosis of PLS cannot be made until the individual is 4 years or more from symptom onset without clinical LMN signs (minor EMG evidence of denervation in the hands is acceptable) . A rare progressive distal LMN syndrome is recognized in the context of HIV infection, but typically has prominent sensory symptoms .","There is a significant multifactorial delay in the presentation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to the neurologist, at which point the diagnosis can usually be made on clinical grounds alone. There are very few credible ALS mimic disorders (and even fewer that are reversible). The ALS spectrum comprises lower motor neuron-predominant, upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant and symmetric limb syndromes. Fasciculation as a primary symptom and without associated weakness is nearly always benign. Incidental spinal spondylosis is common among those with ALS and, if not carefully considered, it may lead to diagnostic delay and inappropriate surgical intervention. Multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block is much rarer than ALS and has a younger age of onset, most commonly manifesting as unilateral 'finger drop'. Primary lateral sclerosis is very rare, has a younger age of onset and has at least 4 years before it can be differentiated confidently from UMN-predominant forms of ALS, which progress more slowly. ALS is the most common cause of progressive dysarthria followed by dysphagia."

A Parkinson's disease nurse specialist (PDNS) can spend more time with the patient and can offer telephone support . The PDNS is a key and essential member of the Parkinson's disease care team; they are usually the first point of contact for the patient, both within the hospital and at home . The PDNS is skilled in patient and carer assessment, differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and appropriate drug treatment, medicines management and communication . The role of the PDNS in the care of patients with Parkinson's disease has been reported in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), although the methods used in these studies have varied widely . The studies reported that PDNS care allowed a swift implementation of good clinical practice for Parkinson's disease, including home visits, and a high rate of patient satisfaction . Physiotherapy in Parkinson's disease is currently recommended to educate patients about gait, initiation of movement and balance, as well as providing advice on safety within the home environment . One study investigated the use of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT), a speech therapy program comprising 16 1-hour sessions, which was developed in North America with the aim of restoring oral communication in patients with Parkinson's disease . In the past, there has been little evidence to support the use of interventional occupational therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease; however, new studies have shown efficacy . The PDNS can advise nursing homes on effective management of patients with Parkinson's disease who have dementia, and the importance of regulating their medication . A double-blind placebo-controlled trial reported good efficacy for Movicol in the treatment of constipation in patients with Parkinson's disease . The need for palliative care in Parkinson's disease indicates a stage when drugs are no longer well tolerated, the patient is an unsuitable candidate for surgery and there is considerable comorbidity . The burden of both motor and non-motor symptoms is high in the advanced stages of Parkinson's disease, such that patients may require specialist palliative care services to improve quality of life . A randomized fast-track trial to evaluate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of short-term integrated palliative care services for people with advanced long-term neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease, is running in the UK . For those people who are approaching the end of life (likely to die within the next 12 months), a holistic assessment that considers their changing needs and preferences should be offered, with the opportunity to discuss the results of disease progression and possible outcomes, and develop and review a personalized care plan for current and future support and treatment . The advanced stages of Parkinson's disease can be a particularly difficult time for carers, and it is important they are made aware of the support and respite care available to them (see Useful resources, pages 161 -) .","Early in the course of the disease, patients most need clear information, advice and counseling. Multidisciplinary therapy and input from a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist (PDNS) should be available to all patients at all stages of the disease. The PDNS is ideally placed to recognize when palliative care is needed, and to initiate and support the appropriate care. Physiotherapy is particularly useful at a stage when balance problems become obvious. In early Parkinson's disease, patients should be encouraged to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables to stimulate a sluggish bowel. Although a large protein intake may compete with levodopa absorption, patients should not restrict their total protein intake. Hallucinations often presage cognitive decline with memory difficulties and disorientation, the most difficult problems for both patients and carers; drugs that are most likely to cause hallucinosis should be withdrawn immediately. Bladder symptoms, sleep problems and sexual problems are common, and need to be addressed. Skin problems are common, but patients rarely complain of them; drug rashes may necessitate withdrawal of the offending agent. Patients and carers should be given the chance to discuss end-of-life issues at the appropriate time with suitably trained professionals."
9781910797471,ch08,"A number of clinical trials have shown a mortality benefit in patients receiving an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) either as primary or secondary prevention (Table 8.1) . Since the early ICD trials, optimal medical management as well as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for HF has significantly improved outcome . In a recent large scale study, patients with LVEF <= 35% without CAD were randomized to receive either an ICD or optimal clinical care (including CRT) and were followed for a median of 67.6 months . Sudden cardiac death rates were low in both groups and the ICD did not confer a significant benefit compared with standard care . This study suggests that the decision to implant a prophylactic automated ICD can be safely delayed in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in favor of 6-12 months' intensive pharmacological management . To improve overall cardiac function and resynchronize the heart, the right and left ventricles need to be paced simultaneously . In patients with sinus rhythm, three pacing leads are inserted: one to the right atrium, one to the right ventricle and one within the coronary sinus to access a posterolateral vein underneath the left ventricle (Figure 8.2) . Although there are no convincing data of a significant benefit of CRT-D, in the real world a CRT-D device is usually implanted because all patients will have impaired LV function . The CARE-HF trial studied 813 patients with symptomatic NYHA class II or III HF despite optimal medical treatment; 50% were randomized to continue optimal medical treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/beta-blockers and diuretics, and 50% additionally underwent implantation of a CRT pacemaker . As a result, CRT is now standard therapy for patients with HF, broad QRS complexes and symptoms despite optimal medical treatment (Table 8.2) . The results of the Reverse and MADIT-CRT trials suggest that early implantation of the device slows down the progression of HF and allows positive LV remodeling . Mapping of the lead position at implant to find the greatest electrical delay between the right and left ventricle also improves the results of CRT . There are few randomized studies, but recent evidence suggests that the patients who benefit the most are those with an ejection fraction of 25-40% and a narrow QRS duration, who remain symptomatic on optimal medical treatment and whose LV function does not require a prophylactic defibrillator . Patients who are not expected to recover adequate cardiac function and who require mechanical support as a bridge to transplantation . Patients who require permanent LV support and are not eligible for cardiac transplantation (destination therapy) . ECMO is a modified heart-lung machine that can support life for days or weeks, thereby allowing adequate time for treatment (including a bridge to implantation of an LV assist device, a total artificial heart [TAH] or cardiac transplantation) or myocardial recovery . The device is used as a bridge to transplantation in patients for whom LV assist and CRT devices are contraindicated, including those with aortic regurgitation, cardiac arrhythmias, an LV thrombus, an aortic prosthesis, an acquired ventricular septal defect, or irreversible biventricular failure requiring high pump outputs .","Patients with poor left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction < 35%), who are symptomatic on optimal medical treatment, with broad QRS complexes (> 120 ms) and left bundle branch block should be referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy. With evolving technology, the complication rate of left ventricle assist devices and total artificial hearts will decline and their use will significantly increase as a bridge to transplantation and as destination therapy. Assuming that the candidate pool (patients with end-stage heart failure [HF]) continues to grow, the burden on healthcare systems worldwide could become significant. Cardiac transplantation remains a viable option in selected individuals with end-stage HF despite the shortage of donor organs; steady improvement in survival after cardiac transplantation has been observed."
9781912776238,ch2,"As with all biological medicines, the challenge for manufacturers and regulators is to ensure that copies of biologics are similar in structure and function to the reference product and have no clinically meaningful differences in outcomes (Table 2.1) . The high prices of biologics are justified by manufacturers on the basis of the investment in discovery, development and production . While discussion of costs may make some clinicians uncomfortable, attention to the health budget is a reality of modern medicine . The substantial savings realized can improve patient access by allowing more patients to be treated from the same budget . Thus, biosimilars will enable stakeholders - including payers, clinicians and patients - to benefit from greater choice of treatment options, and more patients will have access to these treatments (Figure 2.1) . The potential to reduce medicine costs today is significant; of the 12 bestselling global medicines of 2018, nine were biologics and six of those with total sales of US$54 billion face biosimilar competition now or in the near future (Table 2.2) . If biosimilars of those six could be sold at 50% discount, savings would deliver US$28 billion a year to reinvest into global healthcare . Additional savings can be predicted - over the next 7 years a further 35 biologics face loss of patent and potential biosimilar competition . The 2018 European Commission meeting on biosimilars provided an opportunity to assess biosimilar impact after a decade of use . Using list prices, savings from biosimilars were moderate, with price reductions of 20-40% compared with the reference medicine price prior to biosimilars . Opening markets to biosimilar competition could enable healthcare systems to realize savings of more than €10 billion in the EU's five major markets (EU M5; UK, Germany, France, Spain, Italy) between 2016 and 2020 - based solely on direct competition for the originator molecule; further savings are possible through indirect competition for other in-class or therapy-area-specific product sales . Cumulative savings of €49-98 billion could be realized in the EU M5 and the USA combined for this period, although the extent of the actual savings depends on policy development and implementation across all stakeholders in the healthcare system . Biosimilars deliver biological drugs at lower costs than originators because the processes supporting drug discovery and the identification of effective indications, doses and schedules have already been funded by the original reference medicine developer . Economics also sets the agenda for the evidence needed to use biosimilars in practice; while biosimilars must be clinically similar, they have no utility to health systems unless they can be economically different . To maximize price-volume discounts, pharmacy formulary managers will want to stock, ideally, only one preferred brand of each biologic; this mandates the use of biosimilars in extrapolated indications . Also, to maximize discounts over time, repeat tender process cycles will be needed - mandating that biologics and biosimilars can be switched between different brands as part of the typical 1-2-year competitive drug tender purchase cycle without excess risk to patients . To ensure effective uptake of biosimilars, clinicians and other healthcare professionals should be informed of the benefits and safety of biosimilars .","Biologics have provided major advances in treatment of many chronic diseases but are a burden on health budgets that is predicted to increase with changing demographics. Biosimilars provide a lower-cost option to replace original-brand products. In the era of biosimilars, payers, clinicians and patients can benefit from a greater choice of biologics and, through price reductions, access to these treatments can increase. Prescribing a biosimilar is in keeping with the concept of rational prescribing, which includes a cost imperative."
9781910797723,chp1,"Innate immunity is conferred by mechanisms that are present throughout life, such as the physical barriers to infection provided by the skin and mucous membranes, white blood cells that remove foreign material, and serum proteins such as lysozymes and kinins . In general, innate immune reactions provide a rapid (within hours) but non-specific initial response to infection or injury, whereas adaptive immune responses are more specific to the foreign antigen and develop over a longer period (Figure 1.1) . Following activation, phagocytic cells secrete inflammatory proteins, including cytokines and interleukins, which trigger further recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of infection and cellular damage . These recognize and bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen cells, resulting in activation of the immune cell and release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, kinins and prostaglandins, which recruit neutrophils and other phagocytic cells to the damaged tissue . In both cases, immune cells are activated following exposure to antigens such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids or nucleic acids, leading to an immune response directed against specific antigens . All cells present surface antigens that are complexed with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins, allowing the immune system to distinguish between 'self' and 'non-self' . In addition, however, dendritic cells act as 'professional' antigen-presenting cells (APCs), expressing MHC class I and II proteins that bind to antigens and present them to naive (undifferentiated) T cells (Figure 1.3) . Inevitably, such random rearrangements will occasionally produce TCRs that bind to 'self' antigens; in this situation, the T cells are eliminated or deactivated in a process known as self-tolerance . T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of APCs in association with MHC molecules . T reg cells mainly regulate and suppress the immune response of naive and effector T cells through a variety of cytokine and signaling mechanisms, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10 . CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (also known as killer T cells) are activated by antigens from intracellular pathogens presented on MHC class I molecules . Upon activation by binding of the antigen to the BCR, B cells differentiate into short-lived antibody-producing cells (plasma cells) (Figure 1.5) . Full activation and differentiation of B cells requires an additional co-stimulatory signal, from either T h cells or T cell-independent mechanisms such as toll-like receptor ligands (a group of proteins that play important roles in antigen recognition by the innate immune system) . NK cells, which are part of the innate immune system, cooperate with the adaptive humoral immunity through binding of the Fc portion of antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G . Following repeated exposure to antigens, naive CD4+ T h cells differentiate into induced T reg cells, a process mediated by IL-12 production following T-cell activation, and by TGF-beta secreted by APCs . In addition to these T-cell mechanisms, peripheral tolerance may result from expression in B cells of CD22, a non-specific receptor inhibitor that decreases activation of BCRs, and by production of IL-10 and TGF-beta in B cells .","The immune system has two components: innate immunity, involving mechanisms present throughout life, and adaptive (acquired) immunity, which is conferred by immune responses following exposure to an antigen, and is specific to that antigen. Innate immunity is primarily conferred by phagocytic cells derived from stem cells in the bone marrow, principally macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils. There are two forms of adaptive immunity: cellular immunity mediated by T cells originating in the thymus, and humoral immunity mediated by B cells originating in the bone marrow. In cellular immunity, T cells recognize their target antigens as protein sequences presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.- Activation of CD4+ T cells leads to cytokine release that affects multiple immune cells, including APCs.- Activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells triggers clonal selection, during which the T cells proliferate to produce a population of effector T cells, which release enzymes and toxins that lyse the membrane of antigen-bearing cells and induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). Humoral immunity involves the production by B cells of antibodies against specific antigens. Immune tolerance is a state in which the immune system is unresponsive to a stimulus that would normally provoke an immune response. This may be central or peripheral, depending on where tolerance develops. Immune tolerance is an important mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system."
