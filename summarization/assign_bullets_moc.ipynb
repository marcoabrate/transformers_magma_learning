NSAIDs remain one of the most frequently prescribed class of drugs in the treatment of patients with RA, at\n","least early in the disease process. The major effect of these agents is to reduce joint pain and improve joint function. There is no evidence that\n","NSAIDs have any effect on the underlying disease process, however, and exacerbation of symptoms occurs quickly after metabolic elimination of the\n","drugs. They are rarely, if ever, treatment for RA in isolation and without DMARD therapy. The major therapeutic effect of NSAIDs relates to their\n","ability to suppress the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). COX exists in two isoforms: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1\n","is expressed constitutively in many tissues and is primarily responsible for the production of prostaglandins by vascular endothelium, platelets and\n","gastric mucosa, leading to hemostatic and cytoprotective effects. It is also important for the regulation of renal blood flow. COX-2 is undetectable\n","in most normal tissues; its expression increases during development of inflammation and can be induced by several pro-inflammatory stimuli. Both\n","traditional non-specific NSAIDs as well as more selective COX-2 inhibitors are approved for use in RA. The principal benefit of COX-2 inhibitors is\n","the production of analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects comparable with those of the non-selective NSAIDs, but with lower risk of serious\n","gastrointestinal adverse reactions and without prolongation of the bleeding time. Renal side effects may still occur, however, as a result of\n","constitutive COX-2 expression in the kidney. Furthermore, data regarding the potential adverse cardiovascular consequences of both non-selective and\n","COX-2 specific drugs has resulted in a significant reduction in their chronic use. In the UK, in recent guidance, NICE has revised its recommendations\n","on the use of these drugs, recommending their use at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period of time (Table 8.2). Corticosteroids\n","have a long history in the treatment of many rheumatic diseases and they are still a key element in the management of RA. They produce rapid and\n","potent suppression of inflammation, with improvement in fatigue, joint pain and swelling. Prednisone (prednisolone) is most frequently used for RA at\n","a dose of 5-10 mg once daily to minimize adrenal suppression and metabolic side effects. Therapy is often initiated in patients with active disease\n","while awaiting the full therapeutic effect of DMARDs. Recent clinical trials have confirmed the ability of corticosteroids to rapidly control\n","inflammation in patients with recent-onset RA when used in combination with DMARD therapy. In these trials, tapering and cessation is generally\n","accomplished in 3-6 months. In contrast, corticosteroid therapy can be difficult to discontinue in established RA, and tapering should be gradual to\n","avoid disease flares: exempli gratia 0.5-1.0 mg/day every few weeks to months. For this reason some rheumatologists prefer to use a single parenteral\n","dose of a depot steroid preparation (exempli gratia methylprednisolone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide) when rapid control of inflammation is\n","required. This can be administered by intramuscular injection, with efficacy lasting for 6-8 weeks. Intra-articular steroid injections are\n","particularly useful for controlling, with minimal systemic effects, a local flare in joints that show disproportionate involvement. Adverse effects.\n","The adverse effects of corticosteroids limit their long-term use, especially in high doses. Careful surveillance and preventive interventions are\n","needed to avoid undesired complications. Periodic assessment for steroid-induced osteoporosis has become a standard of care for patients receiving\n","chronic corticosteroid therapy, and patients should undergo regular bone densitometry to assess fracture risk. The greatest risk of bone loss occurs\n","during the first 6-12 months of corticosteroid use. If bone densitometry is not readily available, most rheumatologists recommend prophylactic\n","treatment, for example with a bisphosphonate, in any patient starting prednisone treatment and who is likely to receive a dose of 7.5 mg per day or\n","higher for at least 6 months. In addition, the immunosuppressive consequences of chronic corticosteroid use should not be underestimated, even at\n","doses of less than 10 mg per day. Notwithstanding the above, the use of corticosteroids displays significant geographic variation. In the UK, NICE\n","recommends long-term corticosteroid use in established RA only after their potential complications have been fully discussed with the patient and all\n","other treatment options, including biologics, have been offered.\n","\n","Prediction:\n"," NSAIDs are rarely, if ever, treatment for RA in isolation and without DMARD therapy.

Persistent postsurgical pain. It is now clear from numerous studies that persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP) is one of\n","the major causes of persistent (chronic) pain. Limited data also indicate that a significant percentage of patients continue to have pain following\n","trauma, particularly trauma to multiple body areas or traumatic amputation. Although there is evidence that nerve damage plays a key role, there are\n","other factors that probably determine which patients with nerve damage progress from acute to persistent pain as, in many operations (exempli gratia\n","amputation), all patients have nerve damage but only a percentage (10-50%) progress to chronic pain (Table 8.1). The only reliable data currently\n","available derive from postsurgery patients and thus this discussion will be limited to these patients. It is possible, but not studied, that similar\n","factors may occur in post-trauma patients (many of whom also undergo surgery). A major review of this subject by Kehlet et al. was published in 2006.\n","The factors in Table 8.2 are associated with increased risk of PPSP, but no comprehensive study has been carried out to evaluate their relative\n","importance. Although evidence of genetic factors is not available for PPSP, Tegeder et al. (2006) have identified a genetic influence on the\n","development of chronic pain following an acute episode of sciatica. More attention is now being focused on the influence of other patient factors,\n","such as catastrophizing and depression, which influence perioperative and postoperative pain and analgesic use. Preoperative pain intensity has been\n","correlated with postoperative pain intensity in a prospective study of 346 patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The intensity of postoperative pain\n","has been linked to the prevalence of chronic pain. Thus, improved acute pain control pre- and postoperatively may help to prevent PPSP. There is also\n","evidence that intra- and postoperative use of epidural or regional neural blockade may be helpful. Surgical technique may play a role, as 'nerve\n","preservation' techniques appear to lower the incidence of PPSP - although no studies have prospectively addressed this area. The introduction of\n","video-assisted thoracic surgery made no difference to the incidence of post-thoracotomy PPSP at 1 year after surgery. This serves to illustrate how\n","difficult it is to avoid trauma to nerves at various surgical sites, and that factors other than nerve injury are involved in PPSP. In the early\n","stages of PPSP surgeons tend to suspect a surgical complication of some sort (exempli gratia a wound hematoma, chronic infection, incomplete repair of\n","an inguinal hernia). Initially, a reasonable attempt should be made to rule out such diagnoses. However, in the majority of cases no remediable\n","surgical complication will be found. Recognition that the patient has chronic pain, and that the pathophysiology is in the central nervous system, not\n","in the peripheral tissues, is now needed. Patient education. As the majority of PPSP is caused by nerve damage, the treatment options are similar to\n","those for other neuropathic pain syndromes. Pharmacotherapy alone will rarely be sufficient. A biopsychosocial assessment should be made and treatment\n","plans should aim to rectify maladaptive changes in physical, psychological and environmental domains. For example, patients are rarely told that PPSP\n","is a possible complication of surgery. Thus, patients often feel angry and let down and find it difficult to move on unless the anger is addressed\n","with careful explanation and reassurance. Patients may have been stigmatized at work because of a perceived unnecessarily long recovery, requiring\n","input to the workplace. Preoperative patient education about the possibility of PPSP, during the informed consent procedure, may reduce the negative\n","postoperative psychosocial consequences that can complicate treatment. In the authors' experience of patients with PPSP, and supported by several\n","studies, psychosocial factors such as catastrophizing and the pain itself often activate stress and mood disorders, thus worsening pain and\n","interfering with adaptive coping. Pharmacotherapy relies on tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs),\n","anticonvulsants and sometimes membrane stabilizers. In severe cases a trial of subcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) may be necessary. PNS\n","is emerging as a valuable option for postinguinal hernia repair PPSP. In a trial stimulation, electrodes are placed across the path of ilio-inguinal,\n","iliohypogastric and genitofemoral nerves; if the trial stimulation is successful patients proceed at a later date to implantation of electrodes and a\n","pulse generator.\n","\n","Prediction:\n"," A significant percentage of patients continue to have pain following trauma, particularly trauma to\n","multiple body areas or traumatic amputation.

Insulin therapy and correction of acidosis decreases potassium levels, and most\n","patients will require intravenous potassium supplementation to prevent hypokalemia and replace total body potassium deficit. The use of bicarbonate to\n","correct acidosis is not recommended as studies have failed to show any benefit from bicarbonate administration, which may actually be harmful. Once\n","ketoacidosis is resolved, hyperglycemia has been corrected and the patient has improved clinically and is eating and drinking, subcutaneous insulin\n","administration can resume. The prognosis of DKA is usually determined by the precipitating cause. The overall mortality is 3-4%. Cerebral edema is a\n","rare life-threatening complication usually encountered in children with DKA (around 1% of episodes).

The absence of ketoacidosis in HHS is not fully\n","explained but may be because such individuals have insulin levels low enough to cause hyperglycemia but adequate to inhibit lipolysis and ketogenesis\n","because of the differential effect of insulin on lipolysis and glucose uptake. HHS occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes in the presence of a\n","concomitant illness that leads to reduced fluid intake.

Roughly speaking, the higher-level sites\n","bring about the aversive emotional feelings (thalamus and limbic system), alterations in sleep pattern (reticular system and hypothalamus) and stress\n","responses (hypothalamus) that pain may evoke. The PNS and CNS do not passively transduce stimuli and convey sensory information. Instead, noxious\n","stimuli trigger biological processes that then amplify or inhibit the noxious signal. After tissue or nerve damage, peripheral nociceptors become\n","sensitized to noxious stimuli owing to the formation and accumulation of algogenic and inflammatory mediators in the periphery, such as prostanoids,\n","interleukins, bradykinin and histamine. Peripheral sensitization and heightened afferent activity in pain fibers elicit functional, chemical and\n","anatomic reorganization in spinal cord neurons. These changes lead to long-term central potentiation, a form of pain memory characterized by\n","progressively enhanced and prolonged spinal neuronal responses to afferent impulses. This spatially and temporally exaggerated processing of\n","persistent nociceptive information translates clinically into increased experience of pain - not only response to noxious stimulation in the injured\n","tissue (primary hyperalgesia), but also response in the surrounding uninjured tissue (secondary hyperalgesia), with repetitive stimulation producing\n","progressively greater neuronal responses. Central potentiation is due to the release by spinal afferent nociceptive neurons of excitatory mediators\n","such as substance P and glutamate that bind to neurokinin-1 (NK1) and N -methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptors, respectively, in the dorsal horn.\n","Concurrent activation of these receptors allows a massive influx of calcium into second-order neurons, the cell bodies of which lie within the dorsal\n","horn of the spinal cord. Consequently, calcium-dependent intracellular enzymes such as protein kinase C (PKC) are activated, catalyzing the production\n","of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins.

Precise\n","identification of the injured tissue, and the role of that injury in the consequent pain and dysfunction, can be frustratingly difficult.

Early in life, muscle injuries are more\n","frequent, while joint problems occur in the sixth decade of life (Table 3.1). Paraspinal muscles are essential to postural stabilization and\n","mobilization of the trunk, and consist of two main types. The small muscle group consists of two short intersegmental muscles: the interspinalis\n","muscles that bridge the spinous processes and the intertransversarii that bridge the transverse processes. The multifidus and erector spinae form two\n","large, polysegmental muscle groups. The multifidus is the most medial. Its origin is on the spinous processes, with insertions on the vertebral\n","mamillary processes, the posterior superior iliac spine, the dorsal aspect of the sacrum and the posterior sacroiliac ligament. The erector spinae\n","consists primarily of the longissimus thoracis and the ileocostalis lumborum (Figure 3.1) with a third small component, the spinalis dorsi, which only\n","attaches to the spinous processes of L1, L2 and L3. The erector spinae muscles originate on the lower ribs and thoracic transverse processes and\n","insert on the lumbar vertebrae, the iliac crests and adjacent to the posterior superior iliac spines. Although muscle 'spasm' of the erector spinae in\n","association with acute pain is common, pain referral and muscle spasm with focal tenderness (a trigger point) in the mid-portion of the quadratus\n","lumborum muscle and/or a tender point on the mid-iliac crest is more often noted. This can be a consequence of pain referral from vertebral facet or\n","discal strains at either the dorsolumbar origins or the iliolumbar insertions of the erector spinae muscles. The gluteal and piriformis muscles are\n","shown in Figure 3.1.

Possibly the most common manifestation of lumbar and lumbosacral pain referral is to the mid-portion of the gluteal muscles\n","(buttocks) that overlie the piriformis muscle. This is accompanied by a palpable localized region of deep, tender muscle induration. Because of the\n","thickness of the overlying gluteus maximus muscle, the fibers of which are parallel to (and indistinguishable from) the piriformis muscle fibers, it\n","is not possible to determine by palpation if the piriformis muscle per se is the source of the localized muscle tenderness.

In the context of cancer, the term immunotherapy encompasses a variety of approaches, targeting diverse immunologic\n","targets. The history of immuno-oncology. The concept of immuno-oncology dates back more than 100 years, to 1893 (Figure 3.1). In that year, William\n","Coley, an American surgeon and cancer researcher, observed remission of cancer in patients with postoperative bacterial infections, and suggested that\n","activation of the immune system must play a role in combating cancer. Subsequently, in 1909, Paul Ehrlich suggested that the immune system must play\n","an important role in preventing the development of cancer. However, it was not until the mid-20th century when Lewis Thomas and Frank MacFarlane\n","Burnet hypothesized that the immune system is capable of eliminating cancerous cells through a process known as immune surveillance, and that this\n","process depends on recognition of tumor-associated antigens by the immune system. Subsequently, through the laboratory work of Lloyd Old and Robert\n","Schreiber, the concept of immune surveillance has evolved into 'immunoediting', reflecting the ability of tumor cells to evade the immune system.\n","Increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms of immunoediting has identified numerous potential therapeutic targets, some of which - notably\n","immune checkpoint inhibition as first demonstrated by James Allison in the 1990s - are already yielding promising results in clinical practice.\n","Indeed, in 2013, cancer immunotherapy was cited as the 'breakthrough of the year' by the journal Science. What types of tumor are potentially\n","susceptible to immuno-oncology?. Clearly, the potential sensitivity of a given cancer to immuno-oncology therapies will depend on the ability of the\n","tumor to trigger an immune response (immunogenicity). Cancer is characterized by an accumulation of genetic mutations, many of which result in the\n","expression of cancer-specific antigens that can bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the cancer cell surface. These\n","antigen-MHC complexes can be recognized by cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes, that, if activated, could potentially mount an immune response against the\n","tumor. As a result, tumors with high somatic mutation rates may be more susceptible to immuno-oncology therapies than those with lower mutation rates.\n","Somatic mutation rates differ markedly, both between tumor types and within an individual tumor type: the rate may vary more than 1000-fold between\n","tumors with the highest and lowest rates (Figure 3.2). The highest rates are seen in cancers of the skin, lung, bladder and stomach, while the lowest\n","are seen in hematologic and pediatric cancers. It is noteworthy that the highest rates occur in tumors that are induced by carcinogens such as tobacco\n","smoke or ultraviolet light. Potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. A variety of cancer immunotherapy strategies are currently being investigated,\n","or have already entered clinical practice.

There are few situations in cardiology where treatment has been as closely linked to an appreciation of the\n","underlying science. Vicious cycle of heart failure. HF is a disease of inappropriate adaptation to injury. The body has a limited range of\n","compensatory responses to circulatory impairment, mainly vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention (see below). In general, however, these\n","adjustments to hypovolemia are poorly suited to pump failure, and increases in the preload and afterload of the failing heart lead to worsening HF\n","(Figure 2.1). Neurohormonal pathways activated in HF include the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and\n","the natriuretic peptide (NP) system. They play a significant role in the pathophysiology of HF, and pharmacological interventions have been developed\n","accordingly (see Chapter 7). Sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic activation of the adrenergic system leads to vasoconstriction, which increases\n","the resistance to blood flow and helps to maintain arterial pressure in the early stages of HF when cardiac output is reduced. However,\n","vasoconstriction also increases the afterload on the heart, leading to a worsening of HF (see Figure 2.1). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n","Enhanced sympathetic outflow also activates the RAAS (Figure 2.2). Renin release from the kidneys causes increased formation of angiotensin I from\n","angiotensinogen and, via the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes systemic vasoconstriction and acts\n","on the adrenal cortex to produce aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention. In addition, aldosterone (which may be released even in the\n","setting of ACE inhibition) contributes to myocardial and vascular fibrosis. Sympathetic stimulation also releases antidiuretic hormone, which leads to\n","retention of free water and contributes to dilutional hyponatremia. Natriuretic peptide system. The natriuretic peptide family consists of A (atrial)\n","and B (brain) type natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP), which are produced by cardiomyocytes in response to atrial and ventricular stretch, and C type\n","natriuretic peptide, which is secreted by endothelial and renal cells. NPs, mainly BNP, lead to increased sodium excretion and vasodilation,\n","especially in the early phases of HF. BNP also has anti-remodeling properties. The biological action of BNP is mediated through membrane-bound\n","natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) and the peptide is degraded by neutral endopeptidase (including neprilysin). It is postulated that HF is a state\n","of relative BNP deficiency caused by both lack of biologically active peptide and resistance at a receptor level.

Given this risk\n","of thrombosis and hemorrhage, a key aim in the treatment of ET is to prevent blood clotting and bleeding; however, it is also important to alleviate\n","any problematic symptoms. Stratification of treatment according to risk. As described in Chapter 3, the risk of thrombosis in ET is assessed on the\n","basis of age and previous history of thrombosis. Thus, a patient below the age of 60 years with no previous history of thrombosis would be considered\n","at low risk of vascular complications, whereas an older patient or one with previous thrombosis is considered to be at high risk.

The\n","choice of treatment depends on the patient's risk level.

ESL has been approved in Europe as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in\n","patients 18 years of age or older. ESL tends to be better tolerated than CBZ with a lower potential for allergic rash and hyponatremia. The\n","recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily, increasing usually to 800 mg once daily after 1 or 2 weeks, thus offering fast titration. The dose can\n","be titrated further to 1200 mg once daily. Limited safety information is available for patients over 65 years of age. No dose adjustment is needed in\n","patients with mild-to-moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Side effects. ESL is generally well tolerated. The commonest side effects are dizziness\n","and somnolence. Other complaints during clinical trials have included headache, abnormal coordination, disturbed attention, tremor, diplopia, blurred\n","vision, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rash.

Etiology and pathogenesis. Acute cholecystitis caused by gallstones is in most cases due to obstruction of the cystic duct, which\n","results in distension and inflammation of the gallbladder wall, which in turn may result in ischemia and necrosis. Inflammation and stasis may lead to\n","secondary infection of bile. Severe cases may present with sepsis. Acalculous cholecystitis (see below) also occurs, notably as a complication of\n","cardiac surgery or in patients in intensive care units. Epidemiology and risk factors. Acute cholecystitis is the most frequent complication of\n","gallstones. About 10% of symptomatic gallstone patients will develop acute cholecystitis. Up to 15% of acute cholecystitis occurs in the absence of\n","gallstones and is called acute acalculous cholecystitis (see page 31). Critically ill patients in intensive care units who are fasting are\n","particularly at risk for developing this variety. The incidence of acute cholecystitis is approximately the same in the USA and Europe. The exact\n","worldwide incidence is not known but will mirror the rates of gallstone disease. Diagnosis is through laboratory tests and imaging. Figure 3.4 shows a\n","diagnostic algorithm for acute cholecystitis. Symptoms and signs include pain or tenderness and guarding in the right upper quadrant, nausea and\n","vomiting, fever, fast pulse (tachycardia) and a positive Murphy's sign (transient cessation of breathing due to pain during inspiration while the\n","right upper quadrant is palpated, but not the left upper quadrant). Complications include empyema, perforation of the gallbladder, liver abscess and\n","emphysematous cholecystitis. An inflamed and distended gallbladder may obstruct the main bile duct by pressure from a gallstone causing obstructive\n","jaundice (Mirizzi's syndrome). Laboratory tests. Leukocytosis and mild elevation in serum bilirubin and transaminases may be present. Transabdominal\n","ultrasonography is the most useful test for acute cholecystitis as it establishes the presence of gallstones (Figure 3.5). A thickened gallbladder\n","wall (> 4 mm) and pericholecystic fluid are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.6). Sonographic Murphy's sign (tenderness over the\n","gallbladder from the ultrasound transducer during imaging) is also diagnostic. Radionuclide scanning is a useful test if ultrasound is non-diagnostic\n","or inconclusive but there is clinical suspicion of acute cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan uses a technetium-labeled\n","analog of iminodiacetic acid. Non-visualization of the gallbladder with visualization of the tracer in the CBD and the small intestine is consistent\n","with cystic duct obstruction. This test is about 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Computed tomography is useful for identifying\n","local complications of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.7). Medical treatment of acute cholecystitis involves. nothing by mouth. intravenous fluids.\n","intravenous antibiotics. Surgical treatment. The definitive treatment is cholecystectomy, which is usually performed laparoscopically, although\n","conversion to open cholecystectomy may be needed. Comparative studies of immediate (within 24-48 hours) versus delayed (after 6 weeks) laparoscopic\n","cholecystectomy show similar rates for success, complications and conversion to open procedure. However, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy decreases\n","hospital stay and medical costs. Subtotal cholecystectomy is sometimes needed if there is extensive inflammation and fibrosis around the gallbladder,\n","making dissection more difficult and higher risk. Prognosis and follow up.

Despite being the best studied of the glycolytic enzyme disorders, gaps remain in our understanding of pyruvate kinase (PK)\n","deficiency. More than 600 cases of PK deficiency have been reported, mainly from Europe, the USA and Japan, but the disease occurs worldwide, and it\n","is likely that many cases go unreported. This may be because affected individuals die before birth, or because cases are mild and do not require\n","medical attention. Alternatively, some cases may not be properly recognized, or they may be misdiagnosed. Given that some cases may not present with\n","any of the findings usually associated with the condition, there are likely to be more cases of PK deficiency than are published in the literature.\n","Patient registries have now been developed for PK deficiency, which are helping to characterize the range of symptoms and complications arising from\n","this disorder. Prevalence of pyruvate kinase deficiency. PK deficiency occurs equally in men and women. A study in northern England observed a\n","prevalence of 3.3 cases of PK deficiency per million in a mainly white population. Gene frequency studies have estimated the prevalence of PK\n","deficiency in the general white population to be 51 cases per million. In Germany and the USA, it has been estimated that about 1% of the population\n","are heterozygous for PK deficiency, while a study from Hong Kong found that 3% of newborn infants were heterozygous for a particular PK variant.\n","Because PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, individuals who are heterozygous for a single PK mutation will not show clinical signs of\n","hemolysis or anemia. For this reason, prevalence estimates based on the observation of clinically affected patients will be substantially lower than\n","those based on the prevalence of heterozygotes in a population. The Amish community in Pennsylvania, USA, has a particularly high frequency of PK\n","deficiency, associated with one specific mutation, which can be traced back to a single immigrant couple. An increased incidence has also been\n","reported in children from a polygamist community in the western USA, again associated with a particular mutation. Mutations associated with pyruvate\n","kinase deficiency. As discussed in Chapter 1, mutations in the PKLR gene on chromosome 1 are responsible for PK deficiency. More than 300 different\n","mutations have been reported; most are very rare, occurring only once. Currently, about 25% of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency appear to have a\n","previously unrecorded mutation. Although many of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are rare, a few are recorded more frequently (Table 2.1).\n","The variability in how PK deficiency manifests is thought to reflect the heterogeneity of these causative mutations, as well as the fact that most\n","individuals with PK deficiency will be compound heterozygotes (id est they will have a different mutation in each copy of the PKLR gene).\n","Approximately 70% of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense (M) mutations (id est a single nucleotide change resulting in the\n","production of a different amino acid), while the others are more disruptive non-missense (NM) mutations - either nonsense or insertional mutations,\n","deletions (such as the deletion of exon 11 found in the Romany population), or splicing abnormalities (see pages 43 -). Genotype-phenotype\n","relationship. Current research is focusing on the relationship between specific mutations in the PKLR gene and the severity of hemolysis. Given the\n","sheer number of different mutations and the predominance of compound heterozygotes, studies of the relationship between genotype and phenotype have\n","grouped patients by type of mutation (id est two missense mutations [M/M], one missense and one non-missense mutation [M/NM], or two non-missense\n","mutations [NM/NM]). Findings so far suggest that individuals with more disruptive (non-missense) mutations are more severely affected; they have lower\n","levels of hemoglobin and require more frequent transfusions and a greater total transfusion volume. They also have a higher rate of splenectomy and a\n","higher frequency of iron overload (see pages 43 -). Acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency. While almost all cases of PK deficiency are inherited and\n","result from mutations in the PKLR gene, an acquired form of the deficiency can very rarely occur secondarily to other blood diseases, such as acute\n","leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory sideroblastic anemia.

Is schizophrenia a degenerative brain disorder, as originally thought by Kraepelin, or is it better\n","viewed as non-progressive?. During the 1990s, much attention was given to the 'neurodevelopmental hypothesis' of schizophrenia. On the basis of the\n","range of observations outlined in Table 5.1, it was suggested that a static lesion, either genetic or environmental in origin during brain\n","development, expressed its effects as a function of the maturational stage of the brain. In schizophrenia, the characteristic symptoms emerge only\n","during the final stages of brain development in adolescence, when normal 'pruning' or elimination of excess synapses takes place. It is now known that\n","schizophrenia results in part from a developmentally regulated disconnection of higher order association areas, through alterations in neuronal\n","migration, synapse formation and myelination. Neurodevelopmental risk factors. Some established risk factors act early in life (Table 5.2). Obstetric\n","complications generally appear to increase the risk of schizophrenia. During pregnancy, risk factors include rubella and influenza infections in the\n","first or second trimester and antepartum bleeding. Asphyxia and low birth weight, especially with intrauterine growth retardation, are risk factors at\n","birth, as are certain brain insults and infections in childhood. Early developmental delays. Longitudinal follow-up studies of large birth cohorts\n","have shown that the 1-2% of the sample who go on to develop adult schizophrenia show slight delays in motor, speech and intellectual milestones\n","compared with the rest of the cohort. These differences are subtle, such as walking being delayed by 1-2 months. Certain problems, such as\n","developmental receptive language disorders, are particularly linked to later schizophrenia. These developmental delays do not occur in bipolar\n","disorder. Secondary schizophrenias. The so-called secondary schizophrenias fit less easily into the neurodevelopmental formulation. The psychotic\n","symptoms in these cases appear to be caused by a primary organic disorder, either a known physical disorder or a clinically unsuspected brain lesion.\n","Table 5.3 lists those medical conditions in which a clear or possible association with schizophrenia-like disorders has been reported. Antineuronal\n","cell surface antibody disorders involving the N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor can present with psychosis, which responds to immunotherapy.\n","These disorders are more common than previously realized, accounting for perhaps 2-3% of first-onset cases. Clinically recommended screening\n","investigations for first-episode schizophrenia are outlined in Table 5.4. Street-drug use. Use of cannabis and amphetamine-like drugs has long been\n","known to be an important trigger of relapse, but had not been thought to directly cause the onset of illness. However, several cohort studies since\n","2000 have shown that use of cannabis doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk is further increased if minor psychotic symptoms pre-exist\n","and if cannabis use starts early in adolescence. Research suggests that this effect of cannabis may be mediated by a particular gene. Those with a\n","specific version of the catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene, carried by about a quarter of the general population, appear to be especially\n","prone to psychosis after cannabis use. Delta-9-THC, the active component of cannabis, disrupts learning and recall in schizophrenia. Psychosocial risk\n","factors.

'Metabolic syndrome' describes the clustering in an individual of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes,\n","namely abdominal obesity (Figure 3.1), abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia and hypertension. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) updated\n","the definition of metabolic syndrome in 2005, making abdominal obesity a requirement for a diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, and providing\n","different obesity cut-off points for different ethnic groups. This definition takes account of the fact that central adiposity is common to each\n","component of the metabolic syndrome. The criteria are summarized in Table 3.1. An estimated 20-30% of middle-aged individuals living in industrialized\n","countries may be affected by the syndrome. According to some estimates, as many as 75 million people in the USA alone may exhibit the syndrome. Others\n","suggest that as few as 30% of adults exhibit none of the major characteristics of metabolic syndrome.

Patients with metabolic syndrome are three times\n","more likely to experience a heart attack or stroke than people without the syndrome, and are twice as likely to die as a result. They also have a\n","fivefold greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Definition of the metabolic syndrome is of value because it ensures that any patient\n","with a single cardiovascular risk factor, including obesity, is screened for the others, as their presence is statistically highly likely and\n","coexistent cardiometabolic risks multiply the overall risk. It also ensures that a patient with multiple risk factors, even those considered\n","borderline, is managed as a high-risk individual. The aim of management is to tackle the syndrome as a whole, and obesity in particular. Management of\n","single or even multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, for example hypertension or hyperlipidemia alone, or even the combination of hyperlipidemia,\n","hyperglycemia and hypertension, is insufficient; the fundamental issues of excess and pathologically distributed body fat, exercise deficiency and a\n","nutritionally poor diet require attention.

Etiology and pathogenesis. Chronic gallbladder inflammation is attributed as an etiologic factor in gallbladder cancer along\n","with molecular alterations in p53 and K-ras. Inflammation may occur as a result of gallstones, gallbladder polyps, chronic Salmonella infection,\n","congenital biliary cysts, abnormal pancreaticobiliary duct junction, carcinogen exposure and certain drugs. There are molecular differences between\n","gallbladder cancers associated with gallstones and those with an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction. Epidemiology and risk factors. Gallbladder\n","carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and is the most common GI cancer in Native Americans. Incidence and\n","mortality are very high in certain Latin American countries, especially Chile. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer are outlined in Table 3.3. The\n","majority of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas. Symptoms and signs include abdominal pain (usually in the right upper quadrant), weight loss,\n","anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fever, obstructive jaundice (from invasion of the bile duct) and duodenal obstruction. The clinical presentation may\n","mimic acute cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis or biliary obstruction due to other benign or malignant causes. Physical examination. Patients may\n","have right upper quadrant tenderness and a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory tests. Laboratory abnormalities will depend on the\n","clinical presentation of, for example, acute or chronic cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, anorexia, weight loss or malaise without clinical evidence\n","of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. Transabdominal ultrasonography is the usual initial method for imaging the gallbladder. Ultrasonographic\n","findings of gallbladder cancer include a mass in the gallbladder, significant thickening or irregularity of the gallbladder wall and evidence of loss\n","of interface with the liver or invasion of the liver. The sensitivity of transabdominal ultrasound for detecting or suggesting the diagnosis of\n","gallbladder cancer may be more than 70%, but its accuracy for regional and distant staging is limited - 50% or less. Computed tomography is useful for\n","staging to detect liver invasion, lymphadenopathy and distant metastases (Figure 3.8). MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography may be useful in mapping\n","the extent of a tumor. Vascular encasement, particularly of the portal vein, lymphadenopathy and the complete biliary tree can be visualized.\n","\n","Prediction:\n"," Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and is the\n","most common GI cancer in Native Americans.

Acute\n","headache. The immediate, important first step in assessing a new headache is determining whether the headache is a serious, potentially life-\n","threatening medical event requiring emergency evaluation and management. All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and\n","discarded before considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition. Brain imaging, including neurovascular studies, may be needed\n","as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurement and analysis and further evaluation by a neurologist. Chronic headache. As with all chronic\n","pain, headache must be assessed systematically and classified according to its likely origin as well as its temporal pattern, aggravating and\n","ameliorating factors and perpetuating factors and comorbidities. The headache diagnoses in Table 12.2 should be considered. The history should note,\n","as for any other pain, a general medical history, including a detailed pain history (Table 12.3). It is important to note whether the headache\n","corresponds to any cycles (menstruation, weekends, circadian) or particular exposures (fumes, smoke, foods, etc). As emotional factors often trigger\n","tension or migraine headache, psychosocial assessment for the relationship of stressful events to headache onset and extant stressors or psychiatric\n","comorbidities will be important for risk management and treatment planning. Diagnostic testing, particularly brain imaging, may be appropriate.\n","Pathophysiology and associated signs and symptoms. Recent literature has tended to blur what were once thought to be clear distinctions between\n","headaches without a clear anatomic generator, such as tension headache compared with migraine headache. However, it is useful to consider migraine\n","headache and tension headache differently for therapeutic reasons. Migraine headache is now thought to be a condition in which there is cortical\n","neuronal hyperexcitability and/or brainstem dysfunction which activates peripheral nociceptors of the trigeminal neurovascular system. An increase in\n","excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and reduced intracortical inhibition are associated with meningeal inflammation and peripheral\n","sensitization leading to dilation of cerebral vessels and pain. Further activation of the trigeminal nucleus leads to the characteristic signs of\n","central sensitization usually associated with the clinical picture of full-blown migraine, during which almost any sensory stimulus will worsen the\n","headache. These signs and symptoms include allodynia over the face and head, photophobia and sensitivity to noise or movement, causing patients to\n","want to lie down in a dark, completely quiet room until the headache passes. There appears to be a genetic predisposition to migraine in some\n","patients. Tension headache, thought to be due to myofascial pain in the muscles of the head and neck, may be activated by stress and postural factors,\n","or by neural stimuli from an old injury and/or cervical spine disease. These headaches can themselves activate a migraine headache in some patients.\n","Transform headache, often called rebound headache, is caused when the pain-suppressing effects of a short-acting sedative, anxiolytic and/or analgesic\n","wear off so that the manifestations of the sensitized state of the central nervous system (CNS) resumes, often leading to daily headache. Hence\n","caution against the regular, daily or almost daily use of these drugs for headache control is advised. Sinus headache is caused by allergy- or\n","infection-induced sinus inflammation with subsequent blockage and increased pressure. Psychological processes. Stress is the most common trigger of\n","both migraine ( around 75%) and tension headache, and like all persistent or recurrent pain, the headaches themselves and their effects on function\n","and quality of life can be stressful to patients, their families and their associates. As with all pain syndromes, the cycle of pain-stress-pain-\n","dysfunction-stress-pain etc. in headache should be identified, and treatments targeted to each of the predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating\n","factors to whatever degree is possible.\n","\n","Prediction:\n"," All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and discarded before\n","considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition. The history should note, as\n","for any other pain, a general medical history, including a detailed pain history.\n","\n","Reference:\n","In patients without history of chronic headaches, determine whether an acute new headache is a\n","serious, potentially life-threatening
