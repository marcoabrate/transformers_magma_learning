Lung cancer is the principal cause of death from cancer worldwide. The identification of biomarkers that can inform treatment selection is therefore of vital importance.
'Must test' genes. For advanced stage NSCLC, international guidelines by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and ASCO define a minimum panel of genes - the 'must test' genes - that should be tested to inform treatment decisions.
The use of TKIs is guided by the presence of:
alterations in EGFR
gene fusions involving ALK and ROS1
alterations in BRAF.
EGFR. Mok et al. demonstrated, for the first time, that gefitinib, a first-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TKI, was more effective than carboplatin-paclitaxel doublet chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations (12-month PFS 24.9% versus 6.7%, respectively). A similar result was obtained by Rosell et al. for another EGFR first-generation TKI, erlotinib. In this clinical trial, the 1-year PFS with the TKI was also higher than that with chemotherapy (40% versus 10%, respectively). The study authors focused attention on the better response of patients harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions rather than point mutations in EGFR exon 21.
The second-generation EGFR TKI afatinib has also been shown to be more effective than chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutations., More recently, patients receiving the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib have been shown to have a higher PFS (18.9 months versus 10.2 months) and a lower number of high-grade adverse events compared with those taking first-generation TKIs.
ALK rearrangements occur in a limited number of patients with advanced stage NSCLC (3-5%). Despite the low number, patients with an ALK fusion have been shown to respond well to the first-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- fusion TKI crizotinib when compared with chemotherapy (PFS 10.9 months versus 7.0 months and objective response rate [ORR] 74% versus 45%), with a significant improvement in quality of life.
The second-generation ALK TKI alectinib was investigated to overcome the limitations of crizotinib (in particular, the inability to act on metastasis in the central nervous system); it has been shown to be more effective than crizotinib in ALK -rearranged patients.
ROS1 rearrangements. Patients with ROS1 -positive rearrangements showed responsiveness when treated with crizotinib (median PFS 19.2 months and 3 of 50 participants having a complete response).
More recently, in the STARTRK-1 Phase I clinical trial, the tyrosine kinase multi-inhibitor entrectinib has shown promising results in patients with ROS1 rearrangements.
BRAF p.V600E. Identification of the BRAF p.V600E mutation is increasingly important as it supports treatment with dabrafenib plus trametinib in advanced stage NSCLC.
Programmed death-ligand 1. In addition to the must test genes, the guidelines (see above) strongly recommend evaluating PD-L1 expression to inform immunotherapy decisions.
Two clinical trials (KEYNOTE-024 and KEYNOTE-042) have shown pembrolizumab to be an effective first-line treatment when at least 50% of cancer cells express PD-L1, or a second-line therapeutic choice when at least 1% of cancer cells express PD-L1, respectively (Table 5.1).
'Should test' genes are other clinically relevant genes that are being investigated in this therapeutic area. In addition to a negative prognostic role, acquired KRAS mutations have a predictive value in advanced stage NSCLC. A Phase I study showed promising results in terms of efficacy and safety for a novel small molecule, AMG510, that is able to target, irreversibly, the KRAS p.G12C point mutation.
Although the mutations are rare, cancers with RET and NTRK rearrangements show high sensitivity to cabozantinib and larotrectinib, respectively., Entrectinib is another drug that targets the products of NTRK rearrangements.
Patients harboring NRG1 gene fusions respond to afatinib treatment.
A high response rate was found when crizotinib and cabozantinib were administered to patients with a MET mutation causing exon 14 skipping. Capmatinib is another MET inhibitor being evaluated as a treatment for NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping.
Tumor mutational burden. As far as immunotherapy decisions are concerned, TMB is another predictive biomarker. A high number of non-synonymous mutations (at least ten) has been shown to be predictive of response to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, regardless of PD-L1 expression.
Breast cancer
Breast cancer remains the most common cancer type among women in the USA and Europe. Despite advances in detection and treatment, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of death for women in the western world, with most deaths attributed to metastatic disease.
With increasing treatment options for metastatic breast cancer (mBC), it is of fundamental importance to know the genomic landscape of the disease and how to incorporate tumor genomic findings into clinical practice.
Primary breast cancer. Besides the classic biomarkers used by pathologists in every case of primary breast cancer, such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2, which guide prognostication and treatment selection, gene expression profile assays have recently been incorporated into the biomarker assessment of early breast cancer. Commercially available genomic assays that provide these profiles include Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Predictor Analysis of Microarrays 50 (PAM50), EndoPredict and Breast Cancer Index.
Data from two large randomized clinical trials examining Oncotype DX and MammaPrint have yielded important evidence for use in discussions about potential benefit from chemotherapy in specific patient populations. When using the Oncotype DX assay, chemotherapy is not recommended for patients older than 50 years whose tumors have a recurrence score of less than 26. For those patients younger than 50 years whose tumors have a recurrence score of less than 16, there is little to no benefit from chemotherapy; however, clinicians may offer chemoendocrine therapy to those with a recurrence score in the range 16-25. In addition, oncologists may offer chemoendocrine therapy to any patient with recurrence score of 26-30. There are many guidelines published concerning the use of these assays.
Metastatic breast cancer. In breast cancer, CGP is more applicable in the metastatic setting. The recent successes with a PI3K inhibitor for the treatment of PIK3CA -mutated hormone receptor (HR)-positive mBC and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in deleterious germline BRCA1 / -mutated mBC have solidified the role of genomic testing to guide therapy for patients with mBC.
The routine implementation of NGS in many laboratories has allowed the readout of large amounts of DNA, making it possible to detect multiple genetic alterations at the same time, using the same assay, leading to the concept of 'multigene sequencing'. This can be applied to tumor tissue, CTCs, ctDNA and normal tissue (with germline DNA).
The genomic landscape of mBC is broad; alterations in multiple genes have been found, many with potentially actionable changes. Here, we will discuss only those classified as tier I-A (prospective randomized clinical trials show the alteration-drug match in a specific tumor type results in a clinically meaningful improvement in a survival endpoint) according to the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) or level 1 (FDA-recognized biomarker predictive of response to an FDA-approved drug in this indication - see Chapter 4) by the precision oncology knowledge base OncoKB., These are PIK3CA mutations, germline BRCA1 / mutations, HER2 amplification, MSI and NTRK translocations.
PIK3CA codes for the catalytic subunit of PI3K. A gain-of-function mutation can cause the activation of multiple downstream signaling cascades, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that promotes cell survival and proliferation (see Figure 1.6). The Phase III randomized SOLAR-1 trial compared the combination of the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib and fulvestrant with fulvestrant alone in patients with HR-positive HER2 -negative mBC who had progressed on prior endocrine therapy. Participants receiving alpelisib-fulvestrant had superior PFS compared with those receiving fulvestrant alone, leading the FDA to approve alpelisib for HR-positive mBC. These findings stress the importance of clinical testing for the PIK3CA mutation in patients with HR-positive mBC who experience progression on first-line endocrine therapy. Alpelisib is now also authorized for use in the EU.
BRCA1/2 germline mutations result in homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). PARP enzymes are essential for DNA single-strand break repair. Tumors with germline HRD rely more heavily on PARP enzymes for DNA repair; therefore, inhibition of PARP enzymes leads to persistence of DNA single-strand breaks and eventual cell death through synthetic lethality.
The randomized OlympiAD trial compared olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, with single-agent chemotherapy in patients with HER2 -negative mBC who harbored a germline BRCA1 / mutation. The results showed significant improvement in PFS in the olaparib group compared with the chemotherapy group (7.0 months versus 4.2 months). The ORR in the olaparib group was 59.9% compared with 28.8% in the chemotherapy group. On the basis of this study, olaparib received FDA approval for the treatment of HER2 -negative mBC with germline BRCA1 / mutations in patients previously treated with chemotherapy. Olaparib is also approved for use in the EU.
Similarly, the Phase III EMBRACA trial compared the PARP inhibitor talazoparib with single-agent chemotherapy in patients with mBC harboring germline BRCA1 / mutations. The median PFS was significantly longer in the talazoparib arm than in the chemotherapy arm (8.6 months versus 5.6 months). On the basis of this study, talazoparib received FDA approval for the treatment of HER2 -negative mBC with germline BRCA1 / mutations, regardless of prior chemotherapy use. Talazoparib is also approved for use in the EU.
The role of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of mBC with somatic BRCA1 / mutations is under investigation. Although NGS is able to detect HER amplification, it is more commonly determined in the clinical setting using IHC or in-situ hybridization (ISH). Multiple clinical trials have confirmed the role of different HER2-directed therapies in the treatment of HER2 -amplified breast cancer across multiple settings.
MSI. Evaluation of MSI that leads to defects in DNA mismatch repair has become a standard of care in metastatic solid tumors. Patients with tumors that harbor MSI are candidates for treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. MSI is rare in breast cancer, with rates between 0.9% and 1.5%, though the frequency is higher in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes encode the three transmembrane tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) proteins, TrkA, TrkB and TrkC. Fusion of an NTRK gene induces constitutively active protein function, resulting in an oncogenic driver. Two Trk inhibitors, larotrectinib and entrectinib, have gained FDA approval for the treatment of solid tumors that harbor an NTRK gene fusion. Larotrectinib has also been approved by the EMA.
In breast cancer, NTRK fusions are found most commonly in secretory breast carcinomas and mammary analog secretory carcinomas. The frequency of NTRK fusions in mBC is low; one study that examined 12 214 consecutive patients with mBC found that 0.13% of tumors harbored NTRK gene fusions.
Other mutations. Several other alterations described in multigene sequencing, such as mutations in ESR1 (related to increased resistance to endocrine therapy), HER2, PTEN and AKT1, are being investigated in clinical trials.
The value of assessing TMB in mBC also remains investigational.
Colorectal cancer
Globally, CRC is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women. More than 90% of cases are sporadic, the other 10% resulting from hereditary cancer syndromes.
Prognostic and predictive biomarkers have been well established in CRC, and NGS is adding to this well of information. Three major pathways of carcinogenesis have been elucidated:
chromosomal instability (CIN), which accounts for around 85% of all CRCs
MSI, which accounts for around 15% of CRCs
CpG island methylator (CIMP), which is found in 17% of CRCs and shows overlap with the MSI pathway.
Chromosomal instability is characterized by alterations in chromosomes 17p and 18q. In addition, the tumors acquire mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors including APC, TP53, KRAS and BRAF. According to the Vogelstein model, there is initial inactivation of APC, followed by mutations of RAS with inactivation of the TP53 suppressor gene.
The most clinically relevant pathways affected are the Wnt and MAPK pathways. Alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway, which occur in 93% of all CRC tumors, lead to cell proliferation. The MAPK pathway is activated by RTKs, such as EGFR, though it can be activated by other downstream signaling molecules, such as KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS), NRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase (NRAS) and BRAF, as well as ERK.
Microsatellite instability is due to generalized instability of short tandem repeats of DNA sequences known as microsatellites, resulting from mutations of the MMR genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, or silencing of MLH1 by hypermethylation of the CpG-rich promoter sequence (see Chapter 3). Mutations resulting in the inability to repair replication errors result in Lynch syndrome. Hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter can cause sporadic cancer.
MSI can be determined by IHC: loss of staining of one or more of the MMR proteins indicates MMR deficiency (that is, MSI). PCR can also be used, with commercial kits available to test for the five microsatellite loci, referred to as the Bethesda panel, BAT-25, BAT-26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250, as proposed by the NCI. NGS can also be utilized to determine MSI status and allows for analysis of over 100 loci. NGS has 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity as compared with PCR.
MSI-H tumors have been shown to have a better prognosis. Importantly, fluorouracil-based chemotherapy has no benefit in MSI-H CRC.
CpG island methylator phenotype. The CIMP pathway is characterized by hypermethylation of CpG island loci and inactivation of suppressor genes. Sporadic MSI CRCs are associated with CIMP-associated methylation of the MLH1 promoter which, in turn, is associated with the presence of BRAF mutation.
NGS testing for predictive biomarkers. EGFR activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway (see Chapter 1) plays an important role in oncogenesis in CRC. Up to 50% of CRCs show activating mutations of KRAS.
Anti-EGFR antibodies, such as cetuximab and panitumumab, can be beneficial in patients with metastatic CRC provided that there is no downstream mutation activating the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Initially, patients with codon 12/13 KRAS mutations did not benefit in clinical trials, and subsequently mutations in other codons of KRAS and in NRAS were also shown to confer resistance to antibody-based therapies., Thus, guidelines require an 'extended' RAS analysis be performed. At present, the minimum testing required to determine whether anti-EGFR therapy may be of benefit is this extended RAS testing of KRAS and NRAS:
codons 12 and 13 of exon 2
codons 59 and 61 of exon 3
codons 117 and 146 of exon 4.
Wild-type phenotype for KRAS and NRAS is thus an indication for anti-EGFR therapy.
Theoretically, activating mutations in the genes for any of the downstream molecules in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway should result in a pathological scenario similar to that with RAS mutation. At present, though, there are insufficient data to support differentiating the treatment of wild-type RAS and BRAF -mutated cancers and nor is there evidence to support the use of anti-BRAF agents (as there is in melanoma). Nonetheless, a BRAF mutation is a negative prognostic indicator.
US and European guidelines mandate extended RAS and BRAF testing and MSI analysis using the most appropriate methods (Figure 5.1)., NGS provides the widest genetic coverage and most cost-effective solution. Where gene chips for multiple genes are utilized, extra information may be gained. In particular, mutations in other genes (PIK3CA, PTEN) and overexpression of HER2 (ERBB2) may be detected, as may other novel biomarkers.
HER2 overexpression has been detected in around 3.5% of CRCs. Promising responses to anti-HER2 therapies have been reported in clinical trials (HERACLES-A, HERACLES-B and HERACLES-RESCUE).
Patients with MSI-H CRC tumors respond to therapy with pembrolizumab. The group of potentially benefiting patients has now been expanded to include patients with high TMB, which is emerging as an important predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs in the subset of MMR-deficient (MSI-H) CRC. TMB can be detected by NGS technology (see page 45).
The use of validated biomarkers and those currently being investigated is summarized in Table 5.2.
Liquid biopsy. Undoubtedly, liquid biopsies - being minimally invasive - will become more commonly used to determine biomarkers. Already, the presence of ctDNA is a predictor of relapse. Although ctDNA may be utilized predictively in the future to guide patient management, at present it has relatively high false-positive and -negative rates. Current ESMO and ASCO guidelines do not recommend its use for the initial diagnosis of, or as a predictive biomarker for, CRC., As NGS and newer technologies overcome the technical shortcomings, it is highly likely that liquid biopsy will find a more significant role in diagnostics, which will necessitate new guidelines.
Melanoma is a highly mutated malignancy, with mutations documented in all subtypes (Table 5.3)., The KIT mutation is associated with chronic sun damage.
The BRAF mutation is present in 11% of patients with mucosal melanoma, NRAS mutation in 5% and KIT mutation in 15-20%.
From a molecular point of view, uveal melanoma is a distinct condition characterized, in 50% of patients, by the presence of a GNAQ mutation. The presence of BRAF and NRAS mutations has not been described in uveal melanoma.
The serine/threonine kinase BRAF is involved in the downstream signaling of the RTK and RAS proteins. Approximately half of melanomas show BRAF point mutations (Figure 5.2). In the majority of cases, a valine at position 600 is mutated to glutamic acid or lysine (BRAF p.V600E and BRAF p.V600K); both mutations are associated with kinase activation that results from relieving an intramolecular autoinhibitory interaction between the activation segment and P-loop of the protein.
The events result in abnormal activation of the MAPK pathway, including the serine/threonine kinases MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and many downstream targets, resulting in many hallmarks of cancer, such as proliferation, migration, defense from apoptosis, and cellular metabolism.
BRAF mutations are most common in the nodular and superficial spreading melanoma types, and they are rare in acral lentiginous (5-10% of cases) and non-cutaneous melanomas. BRAF mutation correlates with distinct histopathological features, such as intraepidermal melanoma nest formation and a larger rounder border of the tumor with the surrounding skin, suggesting surrogate markers can be used to select patients for molecular testing.
BRAF mutations also arise more commonly in patients who are younger at presentation and those with lymph node metastasis (rather than satellite tumors or visceral metastasis).
BRAF inhibitors can lead to remarkable early tumor responses in melanoma, though these may be of short duration in some patients. Approximately 20% of patients with mutant BRAF melanoma show no response, and most patients treated with monotherapy relapse, with a median PFS of 8-9 months.
Vemurafenib is an orally available small molecule kinase inhibitor with activity against BRAF with the p.V600E mutation; its indication is restricted to melanoma patients with a demonstrated BRAF p.V600E mutation by an FDA-approved test. This agent was approved by the FDA in 2011 and by the EMA in 2012. Vemurafenib has shown an improvement in PFS and overall survival in patients with unresectable or advanced melanoma.
Dabrafenib, an orally available, small molecule, selective BRAF inhibitor was approved by the FDA and EMA in 2013. This agent demonstrated an improvement in PFS compared with dacarbazine (DTIC) in the international multicenter BREAK-3 trial.
MEK inhibitors. Trametinib is an oral, small molecule, selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 that was approved by the FDA in 2013 for melanoma patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF p.V600E or p.V600K mutations. Trametinib is associated with improved PFS versus dacarbazine.
Cobimetinib is an orally available, small molecule, selective MEK inhibitor approved by the FDA and EMA in 2015 for use in combination with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib for the same indication.
c-KIT inhibitors. Early data suggest that mucosal or acral melanomas with activating mutations or amplifications in KIT may be sensitive to a variety of c-KIT inhibitors.
BRAF and MEK inhibitors in combination. In 2014, the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib received accelerated approval from the FDA for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanomas that carry the BRAF p.V600E or p.V600K mutation. The combination demonstrated improved durable response rates over single-agent dabrafenib. The treatment combination is also approved for use in the EU.
In 2015, the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib was approved by the FDA and the EMA for metastatic melanomas that carry the BRAF p.V600E or p.V600K mutation.
Mechanisms of resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. The majority of patients with metastatic melanoma who present with the activating BRAF mutation (p.V600E or p.V600K) respond to treatment. However, 20% of these patients are primarily refractory to selective BRAF inhibitors and do not respond. The mechanisms of intrinsic resistance can include RAC1 mutations, loss of PTEN, dysregulation of cell cycle proteins, and changes to the tumor microenvironment. These abnormalities are summarized in Table 5.4.
Tumor mutational burden. A high TMB augments tumor immunogenicity and increased numbers of tumor neoantigens; it may stimulate an immune response. DNA damage from exogenous factors is responsible for the high TMB seen in melanoma. The finding of high TMB is associated with higher response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Sarcomas are a highly heterogeneous group of malignant tumors showing differentiation toward adult mesenchymal tissue types. They are a divergent group of tumors morphologically, genetically and behaviorally. Although much is known about the individual molecular pathology of many soft-tissue tumors, this knowledge has been applied mainly in the diagnosis of sarcomas, with gene panels used mostly for diagnostic purposes. However, some tumors, such as GISTs, have well-known molecular abnormalities that provide not only prognostic information but also serve as predictive biomarkers for targeted therapy. Examples are aberrations affecting c-KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), which can support imatinib therapy.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Around 80% of GISTs show mutations in KIT that result in constitutive activation of the RTK, c-KIT. Most commonly, there is mutation (SNV or indel) of exon 11, then exon 9, followed by exons 13 and 17 (Table 5.5). Up to 50% of KIT -mutation-negative GISTs have activating mutations of the PDGFRA gene, usually in exons 18, 12 and 14.
A small subset of GISTS display mutations in BRAF, KRAS, NF1, NRAS or SDH.
GISTs with a deletion in exon 11 (codon 557-8) are more biologically aggressive than those with substitutions in the same codons.
Standard commercially available gene profiling chips (NGS) are highly appropriate to determine the genes associated with GISTs. The presence, type and location of the abnormality predict response to TKIs.
Initially, imatinib was the drug of choice, but the newer TKIs sunitinib and regorafenib have also shown efficacy, particularly for GISTs resistant to imatinib. Avapritinib was approved by the FDA in early 2020 for GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation, including the D842V mutation, while the kinase inhibitor ripretinib was approved later in the same year as fourth-line therapy for adults with an advanced GIST. Crenolanib, which selectively inhibits PDGFRA mutant protein, particularly that arising from PDGFRA D842 mutation, is in clinical trials for use in patients with GIST., The second- and third-generation TKIs dasatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib, which target BCR - ABL products, have shown limited results.
Infantile fibrosarcoma is caused by the fusion of NTRK3 with ETV6, which results in the ETS transcription factor contributing its helix-loop-helix domain to the kinase domain of NTRK3 in the resulting product. Clinical trials of Trk TKIs, such as larotrectinib and entrectinib, are under way in a range of sarcomas.
Epithelioid sarcoma. The FDA granted accelerated approval to tazemetostat for the treatment of adults and young people (16 years or older) with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma who are not eligible for complete resection (surgical removal of the tissue). Tazemetostat inhibits enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2); the biomarker is loss of integrase interactor 1 (INI1).
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. In around 50% of cases, and particularly in children, these rare tumors harbor rearrangements of chromosome 2p23. This is the site of ALK, which encodes an RTK that is upregulated on appropriate fusion to one of more than ten potential translocation partners. Specific TKI inhibitors, such as crizotinib, may be used for patients with inoperable/disseminated tumors.
Molecular targeting in other non-GIST sarcomas. Pazopanib, an oral anti-angiogenic drug targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), PDGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), c-KIT and many other tyrosine kinases, was associated with improved PFS in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas other than liposarcomas (mainly leiomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma) in the Phase III PALETTE study. There is, however, no biomarker to guide its use.
Other TKIs used for treating GISTs, such sorafenib, sunitinib and regorafenib, have some effect against non-GI sarcomas, particularly in tumors with PDGFRA mutations.
Other pathways investigated include the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The mTOR inhibitor ridaforolimus showed prolongation of PFS (though the drug was not approved by the FDA), while the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus is effective in the treatment of perivascular epithelioid tumors (PEComas), which are known to show mTOR pathway activation.
Well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas show amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 /. While the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor palbociclib shows only modest results, there is some evidence that dual inhibition of CDK4/6 and MDM2 proto-oncogene (MDM2) may be synergistic.

9781910797631,chp6,"Prevention and management
By far the most research attention has been paid to the treatment of depression, with relatively few studies focusing on approaches to prevent its onset. However, knowledge derived from epidemiology and predictive studies has provided a basis for identifying people who are at increased risk of becoming depressed, and for tackling a range of psychosocial risk factors that are implicated in depression onset.
Preventive strategies may be directed toward:
the whole population - 'universal prevention'
selected high-risk groups - 'selective prevention'
people who have already developed some clinical features but not the full-blown disorder - 'indicated prevention'.
Universal prevention. An area where universal programs appear to be beneficial is mental health promotion for young people using a whole-school approach. The most recent review findings (2017) indicate that such programs have modest beneficial effects, which appear to be maintained at 12-month follow-up.
Universal programs have also sought to improve 'mental health literacy' (public knowledge and beliefs about mental health and mental disorders) to assist the recognition and professional or self-management of problems, and so address the high level of unmet need in this area. Initiatives have been conducted in many countries including the USA, UK, Germany, Norway and, most extensively, Australia, and have mostly involved mass media health campaigns.
Initiatives to challenge stigma and discrimination. Challenging the prevailing stigma and discriminatory behaviors associated with depression and other mental health problems is a critical aspect of these universal programs. The Time to Change campaign (www.time-to-change.org.uk) launched in the UK in 2007, and the work of the Australian beyondblue organization (www.beyondblue.org.au), which started in 2000, are key examples of this approach, which typically involves social marketing such as advertising campaigns, together with education for employers, schools and health professionals. A central facet of these approaches is the focus on supporting people with lived experience of mental health problems, allowing them to play a central role in developing initiatives and delivering activities.
A global antistigma alliance to identify best practices and share learning and resources was set up in 2012. A key aim of this work is to enable individuals to speak about their experience of depression without shame and to encourage them to become involved in treatment. It also aims to encourage more healthy workplaces where people with depression can have treatment support without their jobs being imperiled. This work has been aided considerably by celebrities and opinion leaders talking openly about their experience of depression and their recovery, exemplified recently by Prince Harry's comments about his experience of grief after his mother's death.
Other universal programs. A related development in Australia is a 12-hour training course (Mental Health First Aid, www.mhfa.com.au), which was developed in 2000 to teach skills in recognizing and helping mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and psychosis. This program has been adopted in a number of other countries including Canada, Hong Kong, Finland, England, Wales and Scotland.
Reviews suggest that, overall, these programs result in modest improvements in knowledge and attitudes toward depression or suicide (and other mental health problems), but most evaluations have not assessed the durability of these changes. There is limited evidence to date that campaigns or training increase appropriate help-seeking or decrease suicidal behavior.
Universal versus selected prevention approaches. Although the science of depression prevention is at an early stage, the developing evidence base indicates promising findings, and a systematic review has identified good evidence for prevention among at-risk individuals and those with early features. In general, it seems that although universally directed services are a vital part of delivering health and social care, there are limits to broad-based community education programs. The most efficient and effective approaches for depression prevention may be those that target populations at risk rather than broader approaches.
Selective prevention approaches that enhance protective factors using particular psychotherapy approaches appear able to delay the onset of depression in a range of at-risk groups. Current evidence indicates that interventions based on cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are useful approaches. For instance, a Cochrane review () provides promising evidence for the effectiveness of individually delivered support for postnatal women. Intensive home visits by nurses and health visitors and telephone peer support were both found to reduce depression onset when targeted to those at risk. Preventing depression onset in patients with stroke has also been evaluated, and both antidepressant medication and problem-solving approaches have been found to be effective.
Other investigations have found a reduced incidence of depression in patients recently diagnosed with cancer following a brief psychological intervention, although effects were limited to those participants at highest risk. Similarly, a CBT intervention for adolescents at risk of depression (having parents with depression together with a personal history of depression or subthreshold symptoms) has shown significant preventive benefits.
Overall, findings from trials conducted in a range of settings indicate that preventive interventions may reduce the incidence of depressive disorders by around 20% compared with treatment-as-usual control groups. The extent of effect means that prevention should play a larger role in the further reduction of the disease burden of depressive disorders. Low participation rates in depression prevention programs have been noted as a problem, but it seems likely that the increased use of communications technologies such as mobile phones and the internet, together with appropriate marketing approaches, will enhance involvement.
The attention given to improving recognition of depression in primary care explored in Chapter 4 is encouraging. However, a central problem with innovations to improve detection is that they have not necessarily led to more effective depression management. It appears that many people who are recognized as being depressed are not provided with appropriate treatment, and many of those prescribed antidepressants discontinue them too soon. These management problems relate to the availability, acceptability and effectiveness of current treatments for depression: although considerable progress has been made over recent decades, difficulties and limitations remain in all these areas.
A central issue in relation to depression management is the heterogeneity of this condition. As discussed earlier, depression covers a spectrum of symptoms, and different approaches are appropriate for differing levels and types of presentation. As well as matching different approaches according to severity, a number of different treatments appear to be equally effective for managing depression. People receiving the same treatments show a range of differing responses, with 25-30% of people treated showing no improvement with initial treatment. The clinical benefits of treatment are likely to be incomplete for a substantial proportion of people, with many requiring changes and combinations of treatments. At present around one-third of people achieve only partial remission from symptoms despite treatment.
Types of treatment
There are two main approaches to the management of depression: pharmacotherapy and psychological therapy, and evidence shows that both are effective.
Psychological or pharmacological therapy? Many people prefer psychological treatments, and reviews indicate that drop-out rates may be lower for psychological treatment than for drug treatment. There is some evidence that, for people with less severe forms of depression, psychological treatments may be more effective than pharmacotherapy. Conversely, antidepressant treatment is essential for melancholia, persistent depressive disorder and moderate to severe depression.
The forms of psychological therapy best supported by current evidence are CBT, behavioral activation and IPT. In addition, electroconvulsive therapy is a well-established treatment with good evidence for effectiveness in severe depression; it is generally reserved for those who have not responded to other treatment or when the condition is potentially life-threatening.
Self-help treatment options. Several other approaches have benefits for particular levels or presentations of depression - there is some evidence to support the use of exercise, relaxation training and a range of self-help approaches, as well as befriending, for milder levels. Exposure to light is effective for seasonal affective disorder and may be useful as an adjunct to other treatments for non-seasonal depression.
Complementary therapies. Some complementary treatments may be useful - there is evidence that the herbal treatment St John's wort is equivalent to standard antidepressants in mild and moderate depression (although there are important problems that limit its usefulness, which are discussed on page 95). The nutritional supplement omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be useful as an adjunctive treatment for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder but the effect is uncertain for unipolar depression. Studies of acupuncture for depression have shown mixed results: compared with sham control there is little evidence of benefit, but there may be an additive benefit when acupuncture is combined with medication.
Validity of findings. The evidence for the effectiveness of all these approaches is derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews of such trials. The RCT is a research method designed to ensure findings are free from bias and confounding influences, but it must be noted that there is a trade-off in determining effect by these methods. The high internal validity of RCTs (freedom from bias) is offset by problems in generalizing the findings to wider populations. Trials are typically conducted over relatively short time frames compared with treatment in the real world, and the interventions are often delivered and monitored by experts and evaluated in a selected population, the members of which are likely to be free of coexisting conditions and unrepresentative of certain groups, such as women, older people, minority ethnic group and the socioeconomically disadvantaged, compared with the general population.
Organizational approaches
The effectiveness of individual treatments is clearly important in tackling depression, but much depends on the way that services are organized and enabled to respond to the variability of depression presentation and need for support within populations. Hence the development and evaluation of ways of delivering services is a key part of depression management. Current evidence suggests that better outcomes could be achieved if primary care practices were better organized to identify and respond to those experiencing depression.
Stepped care is a model of healthcare based on matching treatments of differing intensity to the needs of the individual, so that the least restrictive approaches (in terms of intensity, inconvenience and cost) are used. Allied with this is the systematic monitoring of progress so that management can be altered (stepped up) if response is inadequate. This way of organizing practice involves standardizing the procedures and indications, and it has been used for the management of diverse conditions from migraine and back pain to diabetes and hypertension. More recently, it has been advocated for mental health problems such as anxiety, bulimia and depression.
A stepped care framework for providing identification and treatment options appropriate to the differing needs of people with depression has been adopted in the UK and is integral to systems for depression care developed in health maintenance organizations in the USA. The stepped care model advocated in the guidance for depression developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for use in the National Health Service in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is shown in Table 6.1. The subsequent sections of this chapter review treatment approaches for depression with reference to this stepped approach.
The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists also uses a similar stepped care model (Figure 6.1), with a focus on addressing lifestyle factors that may be contributing to the depression along with psychoeducation comprising the initial steps, before moving on to more specific interventions.
Chronic care models. Many of the central elements of chronic care models (Table 6.2) have been integrated in the management of depression in adults and older people, and also for people with depression and coexisting physical illnesses. Much of the evaluation of these approaches has been conducted in the USA, but some evidence for effectiveness has also emerged from studies in the UK and Europe.
Enhanced care packages. It appears that the use of an 'enhanced care' package including stepped care, case management and collaborative care is beneficial and cost-effective for those experiencing moderate to severe major depression. An important element of this care appears to be case management - a specific care-coordinator role, usually carried out by a nurse, social worker or psychologist. This appears to be beneficial because it enables more responsive and proactive treatment, allows consistent psychosocial support and assists with understanding and adhering to treatments, as well as developing self-management. Telephone as well as face-to-face support is commonly used, and outcomes are routinely measured - using instruments such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (see page 57).
Subclinical and mild to moderate depression
Many presentations of depressive symptoms are likely to be relatively short lived and uncomplicated: spontaneous remission and placebo response are relatively common, with around 30% of people improving without active treatment or showing response to inactive management approaches. These presentations do not require formal professional treatment. However, this does not mean that such episodes are insignificant as they may be a precursor to a more serious disorder, and in the early stages of a depressive episode limited indicators may reliably guide the individual or clinician to the likely course.
For this reason, the most appropriate approaches for initial depression onset and for mild depression involve establishing a therapeutic relationship (use of active listening, non-judgmental approach, ensuring confidentiality) and providing simple psychoeducation, while actively monitoring symptoms ('watchful waiting'). If a depressive episode of mild to moderate severity develops, the first options for treatment should include low-intensity interventions such as guided self-help, activity scheduling, brief psychological interventions, supervised exercise programs and computerized CBT.
Self-help and bibliotherapy involves the use of written materials, such as books or self-help manuals (increasingly, other media may be used but the majority of programs are in book form) that provide information about depression, symptom management, condition monitoring and strategies to improve mood and function. These materials are based on evidence, usually a cognitive-behavioral approach, and may involve guidance and support from a health professional (guided self-help), which can be delivered individually or in a group setting.
Typically, a health professional introduces and explains the materials and monitors and reviews the treatment outcome via limited further contacts. These may be face-to-face, or by telephone or email. Several systematic reviews have indicated this approach to be effective in reducing depression scores in comparison with waiting-list controls or treatment as usual, and that effectiveness is maintained even where there is minimal contact with a professional or the resources are entirely self-administered.
There is good evidence to support the use of these interventions for mild depressive symptoms or mild depression as a first-line intervention. Based on this evidence, schemes such as the Reading Well Books on Prescription in England have been established (see Useful Resources), whereby books that have been reviewed and endorsed by health experts (health professionals and patient and carer representatives) are made available and promoted by public libraries.
Exercise. Around 200 controlled evaluations of the effect of exercise for depression indicate a moderate effect on depressive symptoms; however, the evidence is inconclusive, primarily because of weaknesses in the design of many of the studies. Additionally, observational studies commonly find that people self-report that they use exercise to avoid depressive symptoms and prevent relapse, although robust evidence to support these claims is currently lacking.
Various types of physical activity have been examined including aerobic (training of cardiorespiratory capacity) and non-aerobic (such as muscular strength or endurance training) exercise, ranging from water aerobics, ballroom dancing, jogging, running, walking and Qigong (a Chinese system of prescribed physical exercises involving breathing, coordination and relaxation performed in a meditative state). The most recent Cochrane review () based on 39 randomized trials found that physical exercise improves depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosis of mild or moderate depression, but the extent of the effect diminishes to borderline significance when evidence from only the six most robust trials is used.
A systematic review of yoga () found the intervention potentially useful for adults with depression, although the conclusions were limited by the poor quality of the studies.
While current evidence indicates that exercise is superior to waiting-list or no-treatment controls, findings are inconclusive concerning equivalence or superiority to either antidepressants or psychological therapy. It appears that discontinuation rates are lower for exercise than for antidepressants, although the rate of drop out from exercise programs may be substantial.
Important questions remain concerning the most effective type, frequency and duration of exercise: the studies that comprise the evidence base involve a wide range of types of physical activity conducted for periods from 10 days to 16 weeks, conducted indoors and outdoors, and including both individual and group approaches, and supervised and unsupervised delivery. Reviewers have found that both insufficient data and inadequately reported intervention details make it difficult to identify the characteristics of exercise most likely to be associated with benefit. It appears likely that mixed rather than purely aerobic exercise is most effective, and that forms with higher intensity and longer duration are most likely to be beneficial, although this is based on very limited data.
Not only does physical exercise appear to be beneficial for depression, it also has the important additional advantage of delivering health gains in other areas. Although encouragement of any increase in physical activity is likely to be useful for people with depression, current evidence indicates that a regular program of activity is necessary for maintenance of effects. The most recent () NICE guidance notes that a typical intervention is likely to involve supervised exercise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, undertaken two to three times each week for 10-14 weeks.
Given the lack of evidence of superiority of particular kinds of physical activity or modes of delivery, it seems reasonable to encourage people with depression to choose forms of exercise they most enjoy, as this is likely to maximize continuation in the long term.
Problem-solving therapy (PST) is a discrete, structured, time-limited psychological intervention defined as a goal-oriented collaborative and active process that involves identifying and prioritizing particular problems from among the person's current difficulties. It aims to help people use their own skills and resources to improve their functioning. The treatment usually consists of six sessions, the first of which lasts 1 hour, with subsequent half-hour sessions. It is based on establishing a link between current problems and psychological functioning; success in solving and establishing control over these problems is associated with improvement in depressive symptoms.
Important strengths of this approach are its brevity, accessibility and feasibility for delivery by a range of professionals and paraprofessionals within primary care. Several studies have supported the effectiveness of PST in primary care, but the extent and robustness of the evidence are limited. A recent trial of PST delivered by community mental health nurses compared with usual physician-led primary care found no significant differences in effectiveness. A systematic review of psychosocial interventions delivered in primary care by primary care physicians indicated that this approach was the most promising.
Relaxation training. A variety of techniques are available for inducing relaxation, including progressive muscle relaxation, relaxation imagery, autogenic training and methods adapted from yoga and meditation. These approaches are generally well received by clients, with low drop-out rates evident in studies. One 2008 systematic review (which included 11 trials in the meta-analysis) indicated that relaxation training was more effective at reducing self-rated depressive symptoms than waiting-list, no-treatment or minimal-treatment controls, although outcome measurement by clinician-rated depressive symptoms provided inconclusive differences.
Relaxation is less effective than established psychotherapies such as CBT but, because it requires only brief training, it may be useful as an initial element in a stepped care approach. It may, however, be better practice to invest in approaches with stronger evidence of effect such as guided self-help and computer- or internet-delivered treatments.
Sleep hygiene. Disturbed sleep is one of the most common symptoms of depression, occurring in around three-quarters of episodes; it is also a common prodromal feature of depression, preceding depressive episodes in about 40% of cases. It causes subjective distress and can aggravate other symptoms of depression. Assisting people with the sleep difficulties that form a part of the spectrum of depressive features is an important part of initial intervention. 'Sleep hygiene' relates to the promotion of sleep that is appropriately timed and effective. Good sleep hygiene involves adhering to all elements of sleep hygiene guidance (Table 6.3), with particular emphasis on the importance of getting up at the same time each day.
Psychological approaches using the computer and internet. One of the main barriers to patients receiving appropriate psychological treatments, such as CBT or PST, is a shortage of clinicians who can deliver them. Additionally, there may be problems for individuals scheduling appointments with family, work or carer commitments. Internet-based CBT programs, such as MoodGym and the Sadness Program in Australia, make use of the same techniques as face-to-face therapy but these are delivered in a more accessible and cost-effective way via a website. Evaluations of a range of computer- and internet-based CBT programs indicate significant improvements in the symptoms of depression compared with control patients. There is some indication that improvements in symptoms are maintained over time (up to 12 months). The use of such innovations in delivery may be particularly useful in rural and remote settings where access to clinicians may be limited.
Moderate and moderate to severe major depression
The main options for the treatment of moderate and severe depression involve pharmacological and psychological interventions. Treatment choice depends on judgments of severity, previous response to interventions and the person's preferences. Both pharmacological and psychological interventions increase response and remission to a similar extent compared with controls, and trials indicate an improvement for around two-thirds of those in any actively treated group. Lower rates of drop out from treatment are usually seen for psychological interventions.
Pharmacological treatments. In the early 1950s the first antidepressant drugs were developed: the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and, later, the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). These drugs act by enhancement of neurotransmission of serotonin and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), as well as other neurotransmitters. Problematically, TCAs have marked anticholinergic and antihistamine effects, and are toxic in overdose, while MAOIs have interactions with foods containing tyramine (red wines, cheese, liver, yeast extract) that cause a potentially fatal hypertensive reaction. For this reason MAOIs are not commonly used, and are rarely prescribed in primary care; TCAs are more frequently used in primary and secondary care but, because of their interactions and side effects, they are contraindicated in a number of physical illnesses, in particular cardiac disease. They are not recommended as a first-line treatment because of their side effects, interaction, and toxicity: importantly, TCAs should be avoided where there appears to be a risk of suicide because (except for lofepramine) they are associated with greatest risk in overdose.
In the late 1980s, more selective drugs were developed with a primary focus of activity on the serotonergic system, giving rise to the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Drugs targeting the noradrenergic systems were also developed and antidepressants that combine action on both systems, the serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors, are now available and may be more effective for more severe episodes of depression.
New antidepressants are being researched and developed that better enhance neurotransmission and influence allied mechanisms; one example is agomelatine, which exploits the synergy between melatonergic agonism (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and serotonergic 5HT2c antagonism; the latter enhances the release of dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, stimulation of MT1 and MT2 receptors causes resynchronization of circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms ensure that we have the most energy and cognitive capacity during the daylight hours when we are at work, and low energy at night time when we sleep. Circadian rhythms are controlled by the circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and modulated by the hormone melatonin, which is only released during the dark. The circadian clock keeps us in tune with the external environment and the seasonal changes in the length of day (photoperiod), with daylight suppressing melatonin production. It is recognized that circadian rhythms become desynchronized in some forms of depression; for example, the common symptom of waking early in the morning and the changing mood throughout the day are most likely the result of the desynchronization of these daily rhythms. The synergistic action of agomelatine results in release of dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex without increasing serotonin levels, providing the antidepressant efficacy without causing common serotonin-related side effects (sexual dysfunction, emotional blunting and a discontinuation syndrome). Agomelatine can be used as a first-line treatment, especially when the depression is accompanied by sleep problems or poor hedonic drives. It can also be used for patients who have experienced emotional blunting or sexual dysfunction while on an SSRI or SNRI.
Are antidepressants effective? Some recent reviews have questioned the extent of benefit of antidepressants, and there seems little doubt that, as in many other areas of medical treatment, publication bias (wherein studies with positive findings are most likely to be published) has led to an inflated view of antidepressant effectiveness. It also appears that pharmaceutical industry sponsorship of studies is linked to biases in the reporting of findings. Furthermore, in recent years, the difference in effect between antidepressant drugs and placebos in RCTs has been becoming smaller. This has led some clinicians to question the effectiveness of antidepressants. However, the diminishing drug-placebo difference is more likely to be related to clinical trial methodology, with selection of participants with milder episodes of depression that would be likely to have a high placebo response.
Despite these important limitations, the majority of well-conducted meta-analyses provide evidence of the effectiveness of antidepressants for moderate and severe major depression, as well as for persistent subthreshold or mild depression. It seems, in general, that the more severe the symptoms, the greater the benefit of antidepressant treatment: this accords with general clinical experience, although there is conflicting research evidence about a relationship between medication response and symptom severity in moderate to severe depression. A very large number of studies have shown that, around 20% of people with depression of at least moderate severity, will improve without any treatment and 30% will respond to placebo treatment, while up to 50% will respond to antidepressant treatment.
Choosing an antidepressant. In the USA, more than 40 antidepressant medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration are noted in current National Institute of Mental Health literature, while 29 are listed in the current British National Formulary. This diversity of treatment is not necessarily associated with increased effectiveness: there are relatively modest differences between the individual drugs or classes of drug. The main advantage from developments in antidepressants is in terms of tolerability and adverse effects, and notably the risk of harm in overdose.
The SSRIs are far safer in overdose than TCAs, and are generally better tolerated than antidepressants from other classes, although they do have significant side effects. Systematic reviews conducted for recent clinical guidelines indicate that, for people with depression, including those with comorbid physical illness, SSRIs are an appropriate first-line treatment. Among this class of drugs, the NICE guideline for depression and chronic physical illnesses () notes that sertraline and citalopram appear to have the lowest interaction potential and may be protective against cardiac events, with evidence of benefits in reducing the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality among people both with and without pre-existing ischemic heart disease. Another systematic review that compared the relative effects of 12 antidepressants (SSRIs and newer third-generation antidepressants) found sertraline and escitalopram (the S -stereoisomer of citalopram) to have the most favorable balance between efficacy and acceptability.
The balance between efficacy and tolerability is an important consideration in deciding which antidepressant to use (Figure 6.2).
Monitoring use of antidepressants. For people whose symptoms respond poorly to antidepressants, reviewing side effects, treatment preferences and adherence is warranted. Many people discontinue their antidepressant treatment before the recommended adequate treatment period (6 months continuation after symptom remission): findings from the USA indicate that 42% of patients stop taking antidepressants within the first month of prescribing, and 72% within the first 3 months.
Patient education. Communication between clinician and patient about how antidepressants work (psychoeducation), especially that they need to be taken daily (and not just when feeling depressed) for at least 2 weeks before a response will be seen, and discussing treatment concerns (such as worries that antidepressants may be addictive), risk and experience of side effects, and likelihood of relapse, are helpful in facilitating treatment adherence.
Regimen changes. Increasing the dose may be beneficial, but there is limited evidence that exceeding the recommended dose has additional benefit. Alternatively, switching to another medication, either within class when side effects may be the problem, or to another class of antidepressants when the response is limited, can be considered, with choice guided by factors such as previous treatment history and the potential of the drug to cause side effects. Switching between antidepressants because of poor response to initial treatment is more likely to be needed for people with more chronic depression and more coexisting health problems. If there is poor response to these strategies, augmentation with another psychotropic drug such as lithium, a second-generation antipsychotic or another antidepressant may be considered. This is usually undertaken in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist or within a specialist mental health service.
Adverse effects of antidepressants (Table 6.4). All antidepressants may cause side effects, but TCAs are associated with a greater burden of anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and related cardiovascular effects such as hypotension, tachycardia and QT c prolongation; they also cause sedation and drowsiness. The SSRIs are associated with headache and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (nausea and bleeds). Sexual dysfunction is a common side effect with these agents but is rarely mentioned by patients, so it should be asked about explicitly, especially delayed ejaculation. Emotional blunting can also occur with the SSRIs and SNRIs, in which patients are no longer depressed but do not feel a full range of emotions.
Cardiovascular disease and depression are strongly associated, and a number of antidepressants can increase the risk of adverse events in this patient group. TCAs are particularly noted for their cardiotoxicity, while the SSRIs do not appear to be linked to increased risks for cardiovascular events and may exert a protective effect, although some are linked with QTs prolongation.
Bleeding effects. SSRIs affect platelet aggregation and vaso-constriction, leading to increased bleeding times: the use of these antidepressants for people with risk factors for GI hemorrhage, or who are concurrently taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, should therefore be avoided, and special monitoring and the use of gastro-protective agents is required where such treatments cannot be avoided.
Suicidal ideas and acts may be increased in the early stages of antidepressant treatment. This is a small but very important effect that is most evident in children and adolescents but remains for those aged below 25 years. Careful consideration of treatment options and close monitoring of people at risk of suicide is essential. If antidepressants are used for people judged to be at risk of suicide, frequent monitoring and reviews are essential. Direct contact is recommended within 1 week of prescribing and thereafter at regular intervals depending on the level of risk and response to treatment. Telephone reviews may usefully supplement direct contacts.
The quantity and toxicity of the prescribed antidepressant is an important consideration, and judgment of risk by assessing depression features, conducting a comprehensive suicide risk assessment (Table 6.5), and consideration of social situation and supports are all key factors in deciding whether to involve specialist mental health services.
Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms may occur when stopping treatment and can affect one-third of people. Although this response may occur with any antidepressant (other than agomelatine), it is most commonly linked to paroxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine and amitriptyline. Typical features are sweating, irritability, headache, dizziness, nausea and symptoms that are sometimes indistinguishable from depression itself. To avoid discontinuation symptoms, antidepressants should be withdrawn slowly, with a gradual dose reduction over a 4-week period.
Although some people experience severe and prolonged discontinuation symptoms, especially when the antidepressant has been stopped abruptly, symptoms are usually mild and self-limiting if withdrawal is done slowly. The risk of these withdrawal features should be part of the discussion and explanation in the initial treatment planning and ongoing monitoring with the patient. If there is a history of discontinuation symptoms, a longer timeframe may be required and should be negotiated with the patient.
There is no evidence of tolerance or cravings developing for antidepressants such as those commonly seen with drugs such as the benzodiazepines.
Serotonin syndrome is a drug toxicity reaction that involves shivering, sweating, agitation, confusion, delirium, changes in blood pressure, pyrexia and myoclonus. Onset may be rapid, symptoms may range from mild to severe, and the condition may be fatal. It is caused most usually by medicine combinations that increase synaptic serotonin. Management involves the immediate cessation of precipitating medicines and the use of serotonin antagonists and benzodiazepines where necessary.
Antidepressant continuation. For those who meet the criteria for an episode of major depression, antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least 6 months after the remission of an episode of depression (and for 12 months in people aged 60 and over). Stopping antidepressant treatment should involve a discussion between the patient and clinician, and this review should consider the possible need for continued treatment. There is consistent evidence that continuing treatment with antidepressants greatly reduces the risks of depression relapse, and for patients who are at high risk of recurrence, prescribing should continue for at least 2 years.
People at risk of relapse for whom longer-term treatment must be considered include those who have experienced two or more recent episodes of depression, or who have residual symptoms or prolonged or severe episodes. The dose of medication for this maintenance should be at the same level as the acute treatment. Some psychological treatments have promising effects in the prevention of relapse and recurrence, even after the discontinuation of antidepressants.
Other biological treatments
St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) extracts have been used for centuries as a depression treatment in Germany and have become popular in many other countries, including the UK. It has similar effectiveness to standard antidepressants for mild and moderate depression, and has less frequent and less serious side effects. However, inconsistencies in preparations and uncertainties about dose limit its usefulness, and there are serious interactions with frequently used drugs such as oral contraceptives, anticonvulsants and anticoagulants.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation is a non-invasive process that uses an electromagnetic coil to excite or inhibit cortical areas of the brain. It has been used for physiological studies of neurological conditions and as a treatment for depression. A growing number of studies indicate effectiveness for depressive symptoms, although recent reviews report the strength of evidence to be low and uncertainty about the duration of benefits.
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves inducing a therapeutic seizure by applying an electric current under general anesthesia and muscle relaxation. It is usually administered 2-3 times per week, with a total of 6-12 treatments typically being prescribed. Although it is highly effective in the acute episode, the relapse rate is high in the following 6 months, so maintenance antidepressant treatment is usually needed. ECT is an important and effective treatment for severe depression, particularly in people in whom other treatments have been ineffective, or who have a high suicide risk or pronounced psychomotor retardation.
Acute confusion can sometimes follow treatment, and there is a risk of memory loss, particularly personal (autobiographical) memory and recall of recent events. Some degree of memory impairment affects at least one-third of people treated with ECT, but the extent and duration are variable. Newer forms of ECT (brief pulse ECT) have gone some way to reduce memory impairment.
Nutrition, diet and dietary supplements. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (predominantly found in oily fish and widely available as a nutritional supplement) form part of the Mediterranean diet and may be beneficial for a number of medical conditions. Studies have examined effects for depression and, on the basis of promising findings derived from observational studies, around 60 experimental studies have been conducted, although many of these are of poor quality. Most recent systematic review evidence (2016) shows a beneficial effect on depression symptoms for study participants with depression as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association; this effect is evident where PUFA was the sole treatment and also (and with larger effect) when it was added to antidepressant treatment.
5-Hydroxytryptophan and tryptophan are dietary supplements regarded as natural alternatives to antidepressants. Studies suggest they are better than placebo at alleviating depression, but they may pose a risk for a potentially fatal condition (eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome). This, allied with the fact that their mode of action is the same as effective and well-tolerated antidepressants, makes their usefulness very limited.
Psychological treatments. Many people may prefer a non-drug treatment for depression or one that is consistent with their own view of their problem. Psychological treatments have a lengthy history in the treatment of depression. There are many approaches and the six main treatment types are described in the next subsections.
There is good evidence that psychological therapies are beneficial for depression, and several reviews have found only modest differences between these treatment types. However, systematic reviews with the most rigorously applied criteria have consistently identified differences, with approaches that are directive and teach new skills (IPT, CBT, behavioral activation [BA] and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT]) appearing to be more effective than counseling and psychodynamic therapy.
These psychological treatments are effective in both specialist and primary care settings, although one review identified lower effects in primary care, and suggested that selection for therapy by systematic screening rather than referral by the primary care physician was responsible for this lower effect size.
Alongside the widely voiced concerns about the role of pharmaceutical companies in promoting and emphasizing the benefits of antidepressants, the effects of psychological therapy for adult depression have been rigorously re-evaluated. The findings indicate that both publication bias and limitations in quality selection of studies for meta-analysis have overestimated the effectiveness of psychological treatments. Their effects are significant, and clinically important, but seem likely to be smaller than has been previously assumed.
Psychodynamic and psychoanalytic approaches to therapy originate from the work of Freud in the early 20th century and involve exploring conscious and unconscious conflicts and examining how these are played out in relationships, including the relationship between therapist and client. As such, they are non-directive approaches. These therapies are often long term, but treatments for depression that have been evaluated are generally short-term psychodynamic psychotherapies (STPP) conducted over 10-30 sessions. The most recent Cochrane review of STPP () for common mental health problems showed significant improvements in depression compared with control for short- and medium-term, but not long-term, outcomes.
Counseling refers to a range of interventions, often delivered in primary care and by voluntary sector organizations, that are based on the humanistic psychology model and work of Carl Rogers in the 1950s and 60s. Contemporary counseling, although rooted in these theories, draws on a variety of other sources such as behavioral, psychodynamic and cognitive models. Systematic review evidence indicates that counseling is better than usual GP care in improving mental health outcomes in the short term, although the advantages are modest and long-term benefit is not apparent.
Behavioral treatments for depression are based on learning theory, and were initially developed in the 1950s. The BA approach involves encouraging the person to alter patterns of negative reinforcement by scheduling pleasurable activities, particularly with others, and to extend activities to encompass more rewarding behaviors. This has been part of CBT, but interest and application of BA as a therapy in its own right has increased over the past decade. A Cochrane review () comparing behavioral treatment for depression versus other psychological approaches indicated that this approach, which is relatively simple to deliver, was equally effective and acceptable.
Cognitive-behavior therapy originated from the work of Aaron Beck in the 1950s and was formalized into a depression treatment in the late 1970s. It has subsequently been further refined and developed for various other conditions. The key focus is on the ways of thinking that are characteristic of depression and reflect underlying negative beliefs. CBT helps the person to recognize and modify negative thinking through structured collaborative work in therapy sessions and homework assignments. It can be delivered at an individual or group level, typically for 5-20 sessions of around 40 minutes each.
Numerous studies and systematic reviews demonstrate good evidence for the effectiveness of CBT: it is consistently more effective than 'waiting list' or 'no treatment' controls. The review evidence indicates CBT to be either equally effective or superior to other psychological approaches.
Interpersonal therapy is a more recent therapy, developed for depression treatment in the 1980s. It focuses on current personal relationships and their effects on mood.
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was developed from mindfulness-based stress reduction, an approach used to help patients cope with symptoms related to a broad range of chronic illnesses. It is derived from the Eastern meditative practice of mindfulness, combined with elements of CBT.
A central focus of this technique is to interrupt the negative thought patterns that are linked to the development of depressive ruminations and mood changes. This is achieved by learning and practicing engagement with internal and external experiences in the present, rather than focusing on past events or future possibilities.
MBCT is typically delivered as an 8-week group program with a further four follow-up sessions in the year after therapy. The most consistent evidence for MBCT is for its effect in reducing the risk of further relapse among people with a history of depression relapses. Systematic reviews comparing MBCT with standard treatment also indicate significant benefits in symptom reduction.
Residual symptoms, chronic depression and combination treatments
For a large group of people, remission from depression is partial, with features persisting after initial treatments. This limits function and quality of life and is an indicator of greater risk of relapse. Poor treatment response is more likely for people with coexisting medical problems and with concurrent mental health problems, such as anxiety disorders or substance misuse, and negative social circumstances, and for those whose depression is more chronic. Ongoing treatment steps are successful in improving remission rates - a large-scale study in the USA (the STAR-D study) has shown that around two-thirds of people achieve remission with up to four successive treatments.
When response to antidepressant treatment is suboptimal, switching to CBT is likely to achieve outcomes as good as those achieved by changing to a different antidepressant, and this option may be better tolerated. It is also clear that when response to single treatment types is suboptimal, a combination of antidepressants and CBT is more effective than either treatment alone. MBCT appears to be a useful adjunct to antidepressant treatment, as well as a relapse prevention approach in its own right.
Combinations of psychological therapy and antidepressants are also indicated for depression at the most serious end of the severity spectrum. SSRIs together with CBT are currently the best-evaluated approach.","<BULL> The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods. <BULL> Depression is complex, and understanding and helping requires a sensitive weighing up of the many factors that are relevant to the individuals and families affected. <BULL> There are a range of treatments that may be effective for depression, and matching management intensity to the level of depression severity - termed 'stepped care' - is a widely adopted framework for care. <BULL> For milder forms of depression, self-help, relaxation, sleep hygiene, exercise and problem-solving therapy are likely to be effective; for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants or a structured psychological treatment (cognitive-behavior therapy) is indicated; combined antidepressants and psychological therapy may be most appropriate for severe depression. <BULL> Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the first-choice medication but prior treatment history, medical history and drug interactions are key considerations in treatment selection.","Prevention and management of depression.

9781910797426,ch03,"Diseases of the gallbladder
Etiology and pathogenesis. Gallstones (cholelithiasis) are mainly composed of cholesterol, bilirubin and calcium salts. In Western populations the majority of gallstones are of the cholesterol type. These form when the cholesterol concentration in the bile exceeds the ability of bile to keep the cholesterol soluble by association with bile salts and phospholipids in the form of mixed micelles and vesicles (Figure 3.1). Non-cholesterol stones are pigmented black or brown and made up of calcium salts and bilirubin. Black-pigmented stones are more common in patients with cirrhosis or chronic hemolytic states, whereas brown-pigmented stones are more commonly primary bile duct stones found in association with infection.
Epidemiology and risk factors. Gallstones are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age; women are at higher risk than men. In the USA, 5-8% of men and 13-26% of women have gallstones. Native Americans have the highest prevalence in North America, with more than 70% of Pima Indian women having gallstones; African-Americans have the lowest prevalence. European studies have reported the prevalence of gallstones to be about 10% in men and 20% in women, figures that increase to 30% and 40% respectively in older patients. Other risk factors for gallstones are given in Table 3.1.
Symptoms and signs. Symptoms may arise from acute or chronic cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis (see Chapter 4), and some patients present with mild symptoms of intermittent right upper quadrant pain (biliary colic); these patients are at increased risk of gallstone-related complications. However, the majority of gallstones are asymptomatic and do not generally require treatment.
Laboratory tests are generally normal in patients with uncomplicated or asymptomatic gallstones.
Plain abdominal radiography is usually unhelpful, as 85-90% of gallstones are radiotransparent; however, it may reveal calcified gallstones in 10-15% of cases. Air in the biliary tree suggests an abnormal communication (fistula) between the gallbladder and bowel (usually the duodenum); air in the gallbladder wall (sometimes accompanied by an air-fluid level) indicates emphysematous acute cholecystitis (often in association with diabetes mellitus); and, rarely, a calcified ('porcelain') gallbladder indicates a premalignant condition.
Transabdominal ultrasonography is the preferred test for diagnosis of gallstones (Figure 3.2). Gallstones characteristically are highly echogenic with a typical posterior acoustic shadow (Figure 3.3). The sensitivity and specificity of transabdominal ultrasound are 98% and 95%, respectively.
Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) can detect even small gallstones missed by regular abdominal ultrasound. The method is often used instead of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the same setting as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients with a high suspicion of common bile duct (CBD) stones.
Computed tomography. Although CT is not the preferred initial test for the diagnosis of gallstones, gallstones may be detected in approximately 30% of patients when a CT scan is performed for other reasons, such as abdominal pain or jaundice.
Magnetic resonance imaging has an accuracy of 90-95% in detecting gallstones, although this imaging test is usually not recommended for asymptomatic patients.
Surgical treatment of symptomatic gallstones and their major complications (acute or chronic cholecystitis, etc.) by cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is the definitive treatment for gallstone disease, usually by the laparoscopic route.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is a minimally invasive surgical procedure where the gallbladder is removed using a laparoscope. This is achieved through several small (one inch or less) incisions rather than through one large incision on the abdomen. The patient usually goes home the same day or the next morning. More than 700 000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies are performed annually in the USA, while in the UK more than 70 000 are performed. Reported rates vary widely in different European countries, possibly because of differences in medical coding practices.
There are relatively few contraindications to this procedure. They include severe coagulopathy, severe congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; patients with either of the last two conditions may not tolerate the pneumoperitoneum needed for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Previous upper abdominal surgery may make the procedure difficult. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed in patients with well-compensated liver cirrhosis, although there is an increased risk of bleeding in some patients. Conversion to an open operation is needed in about 5% of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies, usually because anatomic landmarks cannot be seen clearly enough.
Most laparoscopic cholecystectomies are completed safely. Overall, the complication rate is 2.5% (comparable to that associated with open cholecystectomy). The main complications include bleeding, wound infection, bile leak and injury to the bile duct. Less common complications include lacerations of the liver and bowel, pneumoperitoneum-related complications, intra-abdominal abscess due to inadvertent spillage of gallstones into the abdominal cavity, and retained CBD stones. The risk of biliary injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy diminishes as the surgeon acquires experience and expertise.
Medical management. Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the definitive treatment for gallstone disease, selected patients who are unfit for surgery may be candidates for medical therapy.
Bile acid treatment options include ursodeoxycholic acid, which works by forming liquid cholesterol crystals, and chenodeoxycholic acid, which removes cholesterol as micelles. This treatment is most successful for small stones in a normally functioning gallbladder and in the absence of acute cholecystitis. Prolonged treatment (up to 2 years) is usually required. Use of these agents may be limited by cost and side effects, notably diarrhea; the recurrence rate is around 50% after 5 years.
Contact dissolution involves the use of solvents that dissolve gallstones on direct contact, but is now rarely used because of serious complications.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy may be performed to destroy gallstones. It can be used on multiple stones, but is most effective for a single stone; the selection criteria to improve the results of the treatment are:
solitary stone
stone < 2 cm
normally functioning gallbladder
non-obstructed cystic duct.
Bile acid treatment is combined with lithotripsy to promote clearance of stone fragments. Common complications of lithotripsy include biliary colic and pain. Less common complications include biliary obstruction, acute pancreatitis and injury to adjacent organs.
Prognosis and follow-up. Asymptomatic gallstones rarely lead to complications and problems. If the gallstones are causing obstruction, they can lead to blockage of the cystic duct with biliary type pain or acute cholecystitis (see below). If the stones are passing in the common bile duct they can further cause obstruction and jaundice, as well as cholangitis (see Chapter 4). Gallbladder cancer is a rare complication of gallbladder stones (see page 32-7).
Acute cholecystitis
Etiology and pathogenesis. Acute cholecystitis caused by gallstones is in most cases due to obstruction of the cystic duct, which results in distension and inflammation of the gallbladder wall, which in turn may result in ischemia and necrosis. Inflammation and stasis may lead to secondary infection of bile. Severe cases may present with sepsis. Acalculous cholecystitis (see below) also occurs, notably as a complication of cardiac surgery or in patients in intensive care units.
Epidemiology and risk factors. Acute cholecystitis is the most frequent complication of gallstones. About 10% of symptomatic gallstone patients will develop acute cholecystitis.
Up to 15% of acute cholecystitis occurs in the absence of gallstones and is called acute acalculous cholecystitis (see page 31). Critically ill patients in intensive care units who are fasting are particularly at risk for developing this variety. The incidence of acute cholecystitis is approximately the same in the USA and Europe. The exact worldwide incidence is not known but will mirror the rates of gallstone disease.
Diagnosis is through laboratory tests and imaging. Figure 3.4 shows a diagnostic algorithm for acute cholecystitis.
Symptoms and signs include pain or tenderness and guarding in the right upper quadrant, nausea and vomiting, fever, fast pulse (tachycardia) and a positive Murphy's sign (transient cessation of breathing due to pain during inspiration while the right upper quadrant is palpated, but not the left upper quadrant). Complications include empyema, perforation of the gallbladder, liver abscess and emphysematous cholecystitis. An inflamed and distended gallbladder may obstruct the main bile duct by pressure from a gallstone causing obstructive jaundice (Mirizzi's syndrome).
Laboratory tests. Leukocytosis and mild elevation in serum bilirubin and transaminases may be present.
Transabdominal ultrasonography is the most useful test for acute cholecystitis as it establishes the presence of gallstones (Figure 3.5). A thickened gallbladder wall (> 4 mm) and pericholecystic fluid are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.6). Sonographic Murphy's sign (tenderness over the gallbladder from the ultrasound transducer during imaging) is also diagnostic.
Radionuclide scanning is a useful test if ultrasound is non-diagnostic or inconclusive but there is clinical suspicion of acute cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan uses a technetium-labeled analog of iminodiacetic acid. Non-visualization of the gallbladder with visualization of the tracer in the CBD and the small intestine is consistent with cystic duct obstruction. This test is about 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
Computed tomography is useful for identifying local complications of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.7).
Medical treatment of acute cholecystitis involves:
nothing by mouth
intravenous fluids
intravenous antibiotics
Surgical treatment. The definitive treatment is cholecystectomy, which is usually performed laparoscopically, although conversion to open cholecystectomy may be needed. Comparative studies of immediate (within 24-48 hours) versus delayed (after 6 weeks) laparoscopic cholecystectomy show similar rates for success, complications and conversion to open procedure. However, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy decreases hospital stay and medical costs. Subtotal cholecystectomy is sometimes needed if there is extensive inflammation and fibrosis around the gallbladder, making dissection more difficult and higher risk.
Prognosis and follow up. Uncomplicated acute cholecystitis has an excellent prognosis, with resolution of symptoms during medical treatment, followed by surgery. Cases complicated by perforation and bile peritonitis have a reserved prognosis, as they require urgent surgery.
Chronic cholecystitis
Etiology and pathogenesis. Gallstones are the causative agent in the majority of patients with chronic cholecystitis. Recurrent or chronic obstruction of the cystic duct results in chronic inflammation of the gallbladder wall, which may lead to a non-functioning gallbladder. There is a small, long-term risk of developing gallbladder cancer.
Epidemiology and risk factors. Chronic cholecystitis is generally caused by repeated milder attacks of acute calculous cholecystitis or by mechanical irritation of the gallbladder wall by gallstones. These cause the wall of the gallbladder to thicken. The gallbladder begins to shrink, and is subsequently less able to concentrate, store and release bile. The disease occurs more often in women than in men and is more common after 40 years of age.
Symptoms and signs include right upper quadrant and epigastric pain. Pain may be episodic and recurrent without the clinical features of acute cholecystitis, but constant right upper quadrant or epigastric pain is the more usual pattern in patients with chronic cholecystitis. Nausea and vomiting may occur when the pain is severe. Episodic pain may or may not be associated with meals, and right upper quadrant tenderness may or may not be present on physical examination. Common laboratory tests are normal.
Transabdominal ultrasonography is the best test to demonstrate the presence of gallstones. Sludge is often seen in patients who have not eaten for at least a day and may be associated with other intra-abdominal illness; however, it is not itself indicative of gallbladder disease. Thickening of the gallbladder wall may be seen in some patients.
Endoscopic ultrasonography may be used in patients with chronic biliary-type pain who have no gallstones on transabdominal ultrasound. EUS may demonstrate microlithiasis (gallstones <= 3 mm and that usually do not cast an acoustic shadow).
Dynamic hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scanning may be performed in selected patients with suspected gallbladder dysfunction when no gallstones or microlithiasis can be proven or if the symptoms are unusual. A low gallbladder ejection fraction on gallbladder stimulation (cholecystokinin injection) and scan is consistent with the dysfunctional gallbladder that occurs in chronic cholecystitis. Reproduction of the patient's pain during the test may help establish a biliary cause of pain in atypical cases.
Treatment is by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Conversion to open cholecystectomy is required in about 5% of patients.
Acalculous cholecystitis
Etiology and pathogenesis. Acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammatory condition that occurs in patients without gallstones. Stasis and ischemia are considered to be underlying pathophysiological factors that lead to a local inflammatory response resulting in gallbladder distention. Secondary infection and necrosis of the gallbladder wall can then occur. Acalculous cholecystitis may lead to spontaneous perforation of the gallbladder.
Epidemiology and risk factors. Acalculous cholecystitis is associated with a myriad of clinical conditions and frequently occurs in critically ill patients, with the incidence in this group ranging from 0.5 to 18%. There are many predisposing risk factors (Table 3.2).
Symptoms and signs. The usual scenario consists of abdominal pain, fever and leukocytosis in a patient with one of the above predisposing conditions. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Right upper quadrant tenderness and Murphy's sign may be present, and a palpable mass may be detected in a minority of patients. Jaundice is not uncommon.
Laboratory test results indicative of acalculous cholecystitis include leukocytosis, abnormal transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase levels.
Plain abdominal radiography is useful to identify emphysematous cholecystitis, gas in the gallbladder and free air in the abdomen resulting from a perforated gallbladder.
Transabdominal ultrasonography is the test of choice and can be done at the bedside in critically ill patients. It may reveal thickening of the gallbladder wall with pericholecystic fluid but no gallstones. Perforation of the gallbladder, abscess in the gallbladder fossa or air in the gallbladder wall may also be seen on ultrasound.
Hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid scanning may be used in selected cases if abdominal ultrasound is inconclusive. Non-visualization of the gallbladder is diagnostic of acute cholecystitis, but false-positive HIDA findings may occur in a variety of conditions.
Computed tomography may show gallbladder inflammation, pericholecystic fluid or empyema of the gallbladder.
Treatment. Patients require intravenous antibiotics. The treatment of choice is cholecystectomy; it may be attempted laparoscopically, but conversion to the open route may be needed. Percutaneous cholecystostomy may be considered as a temporary measure in patients who are too ill to undergo cholecystectomy. The disease has a high mortality, which is influenced significantly by the patient's underlying condition.
Prognosis and follow-up. The prognosis is guarded for patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis. The mortality for critically ill patients reaches up to 50%.
Gallbladder polyps
Etiology and pathogenesis. Gallbladder polyps are seen in about 5% of normal subjects undergoing gallbladder ultrasonography. Differential diagnosis of polypoid lesions of the gallbladder includes cholesterol polyps, adenomyomatosis, inflammatory polyps, adenomas and gallbladder carcinoma.
Cholesterol polyps are the result of abnormal deposition of cholesterol and triglycerides into the gallbladder wall. Adenomyomatosis is characterized by thickening of the muscle in the gallbladder wall with overgrowth of the mucosa. Inflammatory polyps are benign non-neoplastic polyps. Adenomas are epithelial growths that can be precursors to gallbladder cancer.
The major clinical significance relates to the malignant potential of the polyps. Risk factors that increase the chance of malignancy in a gallbladder polyp include:
size > 1 cm
presence of gallstones
age > 60 years
increase in size on interval imaging.
Epidemiology and risk factors. In a Scandinavian study the prevalence of gallbladder polyps as assessed by ultrasonography in a random population was 4.6% among men and 4.3% among women. The prevalence of polyps was not significantly associated with age, sex, social or weight factors, physical activity, diabetes mellitus, pregnancies, use of exogenous female hormones, alcohol intake or plasma lipids. However, in a Chinese study of more than 60 000 people, the overall prevalence of gallbladder polyps was 6.9%. Male sex, hepatitis B virus infection and cholecystitis were strong risk factors for the formation of gallbladder polyps.
Symptoms and signs. Most patients with gallbladder polyps are asymptomatic, with discovery usually being incidental on imaging studies, although some patients may present with chronic and recurrent biliary-type pain.
Transabdominal ultrasonography. Gallbladder polyps are easily visualized. The size and echo features of the polyp(s) assist in differential diagnosis and determination of malignant potential (> 1 cm in size is significantly associated with presence of malignancy). Cholesterol polyps may be multiple, are usually pedunculated and are hyperechoic, but with no acoustic shadow. Adenomas are usually solitary, sessile and more isoechoic.
Computed tomography is not useful for the detection or differential diagnosis of small gallbladder polyps. It is more useful as a preoperative staging technique if malignancy is suspected in a polypoid lesion of the gallbladder.
Endoscopic ultrasonography is a more precise modality for gallbladder imaging than transabdominal ultrasound, but is more invasive. Data from a few studies show better differentiation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic polyps.
Treatment. Cholecystectomy is indicated for polyps greater than 1 cm, for polyps with associated gallstones and for patients with biliary symptoms.
Solitary sessile polyps that are 5-10 mm in size are more likely to be neoplastic than small, multiple, pedunculated, hyperechoic polyps. Cholecystectomy should be considered if a neoplastic polyp is suspected.
Follow-up. Observation with serial imaging is an option for small polyps that are considered to be at low risk for neoplastic features. Polyps that increase in size on serial imaging are an indication for cholecystectomy.
Gallbladder carcinoma
Etiology and pathogenesis. Chronic gallbladder inflammation is attributed as an etiologic factor in gallbladder cancer along with molecular alterations in p53 and K-ras. Inflammation may occur as a result of gallstones, gallbladder polyps, chronic Salmonella infection, congenital biliary cysts, abnormal pancreaticobiliary duct junction, carcinogen exposure and certain drugs. There are molecular differences between gallbladder cancers associated with gallstones and those with an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction.
Epidemiology and risk factors. Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and is the most common GI cancer in Native Americans. Incidence and mortality are very high in certain Latin American countries, especially Chile.
Risk factors for gallbladder cancer are outlined in Table 3.3. The majority of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas.
Symptoms and signs include abdominal pain (usually in the right upper quadrant), weight loss, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fever, obstructive jaundice (from invasion of the bile duct) and duodenal obstruction.
The clinical presentation may mimic acute cholecystitis, chronic cholecystitis or biliary obstruction due to other benign or malignant causes.
Physical examination. Patients may have right upper quadrant tenderness and a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant.
Laboratory tests. Laboratory abnormalities will depend on the clinical presentation of, for example, acute or chronic cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, anorexia, weight loss or malaise without clinical evidence of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction.
Transabdominal ultrasonography is the usual initial method for imaging the gallbladder. Ultrasonographic findings of gallbladder cancer include a mass in the gallbladder, significant thickening or irregularity of the gallbladder wall and evidence of loss of interface with the liver or invasion of the liver.
The sensitivity of transabdominal ultrasound for detecting or suggesting the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer may be more than 70%, but its accuracy for regional and distant staging is limited - 50% or less.
Computed tomography is useful for staging to detect liver invasion, lymphadenopathy and distant metastases (Figure 3.8).
MRI with MR cholangiopancreatography may be useful in mapping the extent of a tumor. Vascular encasement, particularly of the portal vein, lymphadenopathy and the complete biliary tree can be visualized.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography are not needed routinely unless the patient presents with obstructive jaundice requiring biliary decompression, without an obvious diagnosis of gallbladder cancer.
Endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in regional staging of gallbladder cancer associated with lymph-node metastases and vascular invasion. It may also be helpful in differentiating between benign and malignant gallbladder polyps.
Treatment. Staging of gallbladder cancer is shown in Table 3.4. Some surgeons recommend a staging laparoscopy before attempting surgical resection of known or suspected gallbladder cancer.
T1 lesions are usually found incidentally during cholecystectomy and are associated with a 5-year survival rate in 85% of patients. T1b patients have increased risk of lymph-node metastases. Many surgeons prefer reoperation with radical resection to maximize survival. T2 lesions should also be considered for radical resection. Radical resection with an extended cholecystectomy should be performed for stages II and III. Radical surgery for T3 or T4 disease has become more popular and may involve hepatic, pancreatic, duodenal and colonic resection. A hepatic lobectomy may be needed for anatomic reasons in some patients.
Treatment of unresectable disease with palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be considered. Gemcitabine, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil may be used for palliation, but only limited success has been achieved, and there are no firm recommendations. Radiation therapy using external-beam radiation has had limited effect in patients with unresectable tumors. Palliation for jaundice and bowel obstruction may involve surgical or endoscopic methods.
Future trends
Improved understanding of the carcinogenesis pathways of gallbladder cancer and its precursor lesions.
Improved non-invasive and minimally invasive imaging techniques.
Multimodal treatment approaches for gallbladder cancer.
Novel biological therapies.
Cancer vaccines and gene therapy.
Prognosis and follow-up. Prognosis and survival depend on the stage of the disease: nearly 100% for T1a, 75% for T1b, 50-60% for T2 and 25-63% for stages IIA and IIB. Most patients who have unresectable tumors at the time of diagnosis have a 5-year survival of less than 15-20%.","<BULL> The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age, and women are at higher risk than men. <BULL> Transabdominal ultrasound is the imaging test of choice, with an accuracy of over 95%, for the diagnosis of gallstones in either acute or chronic cholecystitis.

Psychiatric comorbidities
Nearly 1 in 3 patients reports significant concern about their mood. Not surprisingly then, mood states and psychiatric comorbidities substantially contribute to the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The three most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are depression, anxiety and psychosis.
Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up to 55% of patients in some studies - and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than seizure-specific variables such as seizure frequency and severity.
Depression is under-recognized and, when diagnosed, often undertreated. Depression associated with epilepsy differs clinically from depressive disorders in non-epileptic patients. Accordingly, symptoms of depression in patients with epilepsy often fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for affective disorders set out in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV). Diagnosis may be further complicated if the patient minimizes their psychiatric symptoms, or if the clinician does not inquire about psychiatric symptoms or considers depression to be part of the normal adaptation to the diagnosis of epilepsy. Clinicians often inadequately treat depression because they are concerned that antidepressant therapy will increase seizure frequency. The consequence of underdiagnosis and undertreatment can be fatal. The overall suicide rate in depressed patients with epilepsy is five times higher than that in the general population and as much as 25 times higher in patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin.
Patients experience depression most often interictally as a chronic, waxing and waning disorder, usually in association with variable levels of irritability and emotionality. Some patients experience depression during a simple partial seizure (ictal depression) or during the postictal state.
Before therapy is initiated, iatrogenic causes should be excluded. Antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment can be contributory, especially phenobarbital (PB), primidone (PRM), vigabatrin (VGB), topiramate (TPM), levetiracetam (LEV) and zonisamide (ZNS). Conversely, depression that follows the discontinuation of an AED with mood-stabilizing properties (exempli gratia lamotrigine [LTG]) can also be treated by reinstituting the AED.
Few controlled trials of antidepressants have been conducted in patients with epilepsy and depression. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line treatments, especially citalopram and sertraline, which have minimal pharmacokinetic interactions with AEDs. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can be given as second-line therapy. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and non-TCAs are probably best avoided. Clomipramine and lithium are more likely to worsen seizure frequency than other antidepressants. Electroconvulsive therapy is not absolutely contraindicated in patients with epilepsy but should be reserved for medication-resistant depression. In addition to antidepressants, contributing psychosocial factors should be sought and addressed by qualified professionals (see Fast Facts: Depression).
Anxiety is the second most common psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy, with a prevalence of up to 50% in some studies. Anxiety markedly compromises quality of life and psychosocial functioning, even more so than depression in one study. Ictal anxiety may be mistaken for a panic disorder. Patients experience anxiety most commonly interictally in the form of a generalized anxiety disorder. Severity of anxiety does not necessarily correlate with seizure frequency. SSRIs and benzodiazepines are most often used, though no controlled studies in patients with epilepsy have been reported. Some AEDs, such as sodium valproate (VPA), gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB), have anti-anxiety properties (see Fast Facts: Anxiety, Panic and Phobias).
Psychosis. The incidence of psychosis varies according to the epilepsy syndrome, from 3.3% in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy to 14% in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, it correlates with epilepsy severity: psychosis occurs in 0.6-7% of patients with epilepsy in the community and 19-27% of patients with epilepsy who require hospitalization.
Ictal psychosis presents as hallucinations or delusions. Symptoms are usually self-limiting and can be mistaken for schizophrenia or mania, but unlike a primary psychiatric disorder are associated with a pattern of non-convulsive status epilepticus on electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Postictal psychosis generally begins years after the onset of epilepsy. The typical pattern is a cluster of complex partial seizures, followed by a lucid postictal period. In turn, this lucid period is followed by affective symptoms together with grandiose and religious delusions, as well as simple auditory hallucinations. Patients with bilateral seizure foci, bilateral limbic lesions and clusters of complex partial seizures are at particularly high risk.
Interictal psychosis manifests as delusions and hallucinations; disorganized behavior and thought disorders may also occur. Compared with patients with schizophrenia, patients with interictal psychosis have an absence of negative symptoms, better premorbid state, less deterioration of personality and better response to pharmacotherapy.
There are no controlled trials of antipsychotic or atypical antipsychotic medications in patients with epilepsy and psychosis. Haloperidol, molindone, fluphenazine, perphenazine and risperidone appear less likely to worsen seizure frequency than clozapine and loxapine. Some AEDs, such as TPM, VGB and LEV, can occasionally produce psychotic reactions in susceptible patients.
Drug interactions
Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, especially fluoxetine and paroxetine, may increase serum concentrations of carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin (PHT). These drugs also elevate serum concentrations of TCAs.
Tricyclic antidepressants. Serum concentrations of TCAs (which are metabolized by the 2D6 hepatic isoenzyme) are generally reduced by hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs such as CBZ, PHT, PB and PRM. Conversely, VPA inhibits the metabolism of TCAs and may increase their circulating concentrations.
Antipsychotics. Most antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol, perphenazine, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, thiothixene and risperidone, are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 and/or 3A4 hepatic isoenzymes and therefore their serum concentrations are lowered by hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs such as CBZ, PHT, PB and PRM, and increased by VPA.
Social aspects
There are very few, if any, aspects of daily living that remain unaffected by the diagnosis of epilepsy. Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle.
There are very few, if any, aspects of daily living that remain unaffected by the diagnosis of epilepsy. Restrictions on independence can be the most socially disabling - in particular the effects of epilepsy on employment, driving, life insurance and lifestyle.
Employment is important for self-esteem, supporting an independent lifestyle, and affording health insurance and the costs of epilepsy treatment. Numerous surveys show that rates of unemployment and underemployment are much higher in patients with epilepsy than in the general population. Factors most often cited are lack of available transportation (particularly if seizures preclude driving), negative attitudes of employers and employees towards epilepsy, and lack of experience in the workplace. Patients whose education was interrupted by epilepsy-related complications may need additional vocational training before they seek employment.
Clinicians should encourage their patients to work whenever possible and to recommend they seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. In the USA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was amended in 2008 to further protect the rights of persons with epilepsy, protects a person from being denied employment because of a medical condition if that person can perform the essential duties of that job. In the UK, in line with several other European countries, a similar Disabilities Discrimination Act was introduced in 1995 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in employment. Whether patients should disclose their epilepsy before being hired is best dealt with on a case-by-case basis.
Driving is often viewed as essential to holding a job and living independently. However, as driving is a privilege, applicants must meet the requirements established by their state, province or country to qualify for a driver's license. With reference to epilepsy, these requirements usually specify a seizure-free interval necessary for driving, the obligations of the patient and the physician to notify the authorities of the patient's status, and allowances that are made under certain circumstances such as seizures that only occur during sleep or seizures that occur during a physician-prescribed AED taper. Clinicians should be thoroughly familiar with the applicable laws where they practice, and should clearly document their discussions with patients. Clinicians should also remember that side effects of AEDs, especially sedation, may interfere with a patient's ability to safely operate a vehicle, and should advise patients accordingly.
Life insurance. Patients with epilepsy may be unable to find affordable life insurance, particularly if applying for an individual policy. Most insurance companies ascribe a globally higher risk of mortality to people with seizures, irrespective of the applicant's frequency or severity of seizures. Patients who obtain life insurance through their place of employment generally do not have a problem.
Lifestyle considerations. Clinicians should counsel patients on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures and help maintain overall health without unduly limiting activities that bring enjoyment and fulfillment. Reducing or eliminating the consumption of alcohol, engaging in stress-reducing behaviors, eating regularly and getting adequate sleep may help to reduce seizure frequency. Regular aerobic exercise, especially conducted in such a way that having a seizure would not pose a safety risk, is important for general maintenance of health as well as bone health. Participation in organized sports is generally possible, though the possibility of concussion should be minimized and athletes should consider discussing their condition with team trainers and doctors in advance.","<BULL> Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life. <BULL> The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures. <BULL> Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures. <BULL> When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. <BULL> Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. <BULL> Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients. <BULL> Patients with epilepsy may have difficulty in finding affordable life insurance. <BULL> Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures without unduly limiting activities.","Quality of life in patients with epilepsy is important for the quality of life of patients with epilepsy.Psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are important for quality of life and for the quality of health of the patient.

9781910797907,chp6,"Supportive treatment
At present, the main focus of care for pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is with supportive therapies.
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequently used to support patients with PK deficiency, particularly during the first months of life. However, transfusion thresholds and guidelines used in other red cell disorders, such as thalassemia major or intermedia, do not necessarily apply to PK deficiency.
When to transfuse. There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals., The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. As explained in Chapter 1, an increase in red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate results in enhanced oxygen off-loading into the tissues. Consequently, patients may tolerate moderately severe anemia with few symptoms. When patients have a transfusion, the goal nadir hemoglobin level should also be based on symptoms rather than on a level extrapolated from guidelines used in other anemias.
Many patients with PK deficiency will never need a transfusion or will only require intermittent, or unplanned, transfusions during hemolytic crises due to infections or an aplastic crisis associated with parvovirus infection. Others may remain on regular transfusion therapy until splenectomy is considered.
Hemoglobin goals. During the first years of life, hemoglobin goals are those that allow for normal growth and development, and young children are often reliant on frequent transfusions to decrease symptoms and improve growth. As individuals age through adulthood, transfusion requirements may increase despite a stable hemoglobin, as a result of increased symptoms from the anemia, perhaps related to increased daily activity.
Complications. Transfusions are associated with iron loading, and chelation therapy is necessary in patients who receive regular transfusions (see Table 5.3).
The hypoxic and glucose-restricted environment of the spleen poses a problem to PK-deficient reticulocytes, which rely on oxidative phosphorylation to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Impaired ATP production leads to RBC destruction in the spleen. Severely PK-deficient reticulocytes are metabolically more stable in the absence of the spleen; therefore, a paradoxical, sustained, robust reticulocytosis follows splenectomy in this disorder.
Partial splenectomy has been performed in a few patients with PK deficiency, but has not been beneficial.
The benefits of splenectomy. Before splenectomy, the reticulocyte count may be inappropriately low or mildly to moderately increased (5-15%). After splenectomy, reticulocyte counts can be as high as 50-70% and, with the extended lifespan of PK-deficient reticulocytes in the absence of the spleen, hemoglobin levels increase by a median of 1.6 g/dL.
Splenectomy partially ameliorates the anemia in most patients and is beneficial in decreasing the need for transfusions in 90% of patients. In patients who received regular transfusions before splenectomy, approximately 80% can discontinue transfusions altogether following surgery. However, in almost all patients, an incompletely compensated hemolytic process persists, in which mild anemia, reticulocytosis and indirect hyperbilirubinemia continue.
Poor responders. Approximately 14% of patients on regular transfusions prior to splenectomy will have a poor response and will continue to require regular transfusions. In these cases, imaging to evaluate for a splenule or secondary spleen is indicated, but these are rarely found.
Patient selection. Preoperative assessment of red cell survival, splenic sequestration and/or spleen size is of no value in selecting patients for splenectomy. In part, this reflects the importance of the liver as a site of RBCl destruction. Low pre-splenectomy hemoglobin levels are associated with a poorer response to splenectomy in terms of the post-splenectomy hemoglobin rise and/or transfusion burden.
The burden of transfusions in PK deficiency varies between patients. The decision whether to have a splenectomy to improve the anemia of PK deficiency is complex and depends on both the physician's and the patient's perspective of the potential benefits and risks. Recent guidelines recommend splenectomy in patients who are reliant on regular transfusions or are severely anemic. Splenectomy should also be considered in patients who receive intermittent transfusions with every infectious illness or who have symptomatic anemia.
The timing of splenectomy is based on the risk-benefit assessment. Splenectomy in young children is associated with an increased risk of post-splenectomy sepsis, while a delay in splenectomy in patients who receive regular transfusions is associated with increased iron loading.
Post-splenectomy sepsis. Splenectomy increases susceptibility to serious bacterial infections with encapsulated organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Capnocytophaga canimorsus. In the absence of a spleen, individuals are also at risk of severe babesiosis and malaria. With adequate vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics, the absolute risk of a serious infection is very low. Nevertheless, because of these lifelong infectious risks, surgery should be avoided altogether or preferably delayed until at least 5 years of age. If splenectomy is needed at an earlier age, the benefits must be balanced against the risk of infection.
Vaccination. Since the spleen is the primary site for the production of immunoglobulin M antibodies, which are required for opsonization of encapsulated organisms, vaccination prior to splenectomy is much preferred. Vaccination schedules are frequently updated based on new information and vaccine development. Therefore, physicians should refer to an updated website rather than to articles or books for a list and schedule of vaccinations before splenectomy. A useful website is www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html. It is recommended that all vaccines are given at least 2 weeks before splenectomy.
Antibiotic prophylaxis. Oral antibiotics for infection prophylaxis are indicated after splenectomy. Strategies include daily antibiotic prophylaxis and empiric antibiotics administered for febrile illnesses. The ideal duration for prophylactic antibiotics is not clear, and practice varies by country. Some physicians recommend a lifetime of prophylactic antibiotics, while others recommend discontinuation after 1 year if patients live close to a medical center and agree to seek urgent medical care for all fevers.
Most physicians recommend that asplenic children receive daily prophylaxis with penicillin VK until at least 5 years of age and for at least 1 year following splenectomy.
Once splenectomized, if an individual has a fever of 38.5°C (101.5°F) or higher, they should be seen urgently for a blood culture and complete blood count and given intravenous or intramuscular broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Post-splenectomy thrombosis. Many studies demonstrate an overall increased risk of thrombosis after splenectomy, including in otherwise healthy individuals. After splenectomy, the overall risk of thrombosis in PK deficiency is approximately 10%, including portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and central nervous system thrombosis.
Although the etiology for the increased risk is not clear, some physicians recommend taking low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after splenectomy, particularly in patients with marked thrombocytosis, to potentially decrease this risk.
Folic acid
With the reticulocytosis associated with PK deficiency, folic acid needs are increased. Supplemental folic acid may be needed, depending on the patient's dietary folic acid intake.","<BULL> The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors. <BULL> The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin.

9781908541277,ch_8,"Antiepileptic drugs
Established antiepileptic drugs
Despite the recent entry into the marketplace of a wide range of new pharmacological options, most patients still receive treatment with one of the older antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Comparative pharmacokinetics, indications and a guide to dosing in children and adults are summarized in Tables 5.1 - 5.3.
Chapter 4 sets out the main principles of drug selection and overall pharmacological management. Here, the use of each drug is considered in terms of its mechanism of action, indication, dosage, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. Problems likely to be encountered in everyday clinical practice are highlighted.
Carbamazepine (CBZ) was synthesized by Schindler at Geigy in 1953 in an attempt to compete with the newly introduced antipsychotic chlorpromazine. The first clinical studies in epilepsy were not carried out until 1963. CBZ acts by preventing repetitive firing of action potentials in depolarized neurons via use- and voltage-dependent blockade of sodium channels.
Indications. Over the years, CBZ has gained acceptance as a first-line treatment for partial and tonic-clonic seizures. It is not effective for, and may even exacerbate, generalized absences and myoclonic seizures.
Dosage. CBZ should be introduced at low doses (100-200 mg daily) with 100-200 mg increments every 3-14 days, depending on the urgency of the situation. Slow introduction facilitates tolerance to its central nervous system (CNS) side effects and allows hepatic auto-induction of CBZ metabolism to take place. The dose can be increased over the first month or two to a maintenance amount that completely controls the seizure disorder. A balance must be achieved in the individual patient between speed of seizure control and acceptance of temporary CNS toxicity. The final dose will depend on the extent to which CBZ induces its own metabolism (Figure 5.1).
Despite this careful approach, some patients will be unable to tolerate the neurotoxic side effects of CBZ, even at low doses and serum concentrations. Diplopia, headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting are the most common complaints. For some patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, these symptoms cause a dose ceiling, which may be less than an effective dose. High peak concentrations often result in intermittent side effects around 2 hours after dosing, necessitating administration three or four times daily in some patients. Such problems can be overcome by prescribing a controlled-release formulation that can be given twice daily, or by shifting a greater percentage of the total daily dose to bedtime, particularly when the patient has only nocturnal or early morning seizures.
Side effects. In addition to the CNS toxicity described above, CBZ can cause a range of idiosyncratic reactions, the most common of which is a morbilliform rash in 5-10% of patients (Figure 5.2). Other unusual, but more severe, skin eruptions include erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. To minimize the risk of the latter, individuals with ancestry from broad areas of Asia should be tested for HLA-B*15:02 before CBZ is initiated. CBZ should be avoided if the patient tests positive (see Side effects). Another allele, HLA-A*31:01, has recently been identified in European and Japanese patients who develop a range of skin reactions with CBZ. Reversible mild leukopenia often occurs within the first few months of treatment, but therapy does not need to be discontinued unless there is also evidence of infection or if the white-cell count slips well below 2000 x 10 /liter. Potentially fatal blood dyscrasias and toxic hepatitis are much rarer. At high concentrations, the drug has an antidiuretic-hormone-like action that can result in fluid retention in elderly patients or in those with cardiac failure. Mild hyponatremia is usually asymptomatic, but if the serum sodium level falls below 120 mmol/liter the patient may present with confusion, peripheral edema and deterioration in seizure control. A dose-dependent increase in major malformations has been reported in children exposed to CBZ in utero.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. As well as inducing its own metabolism (see Figure 5.1), CBZ can accelerate the hepatic breakdown of a number of lipid-soluble drugs. The most common interaction is with the oral contraceptive pill, necessitating a daily estrogen dose of 50 µg or more for most women. Other important interactions are with sodium valproate (VPA), ethosuximide (ESM), corticosteroids, anticoagulants, antipsychotics, cytotoxics, antiretrovirals, statins and immunosuppressants. CBZ also increases the clearance of perampanel (PER) by up to threefold.
Drugs that inhibit CBZ metabolism resulting in toxicity include phenytoin (PHT), cimetidine, dextropropoxyphene, diltiazem, erythromycin, isoniazid, verapamil, viloxazine and fluoxetine. The substantial variation of CBZ concentrations in any given patient over the course of a day - as much as 100% with twice-daily dosing - makes the interpretation of concentration monitoring problematic unless the times of dosing and blood sampling are standardized. In many patients, the dose can be titrated adequately on clinical criteria alone. Exceptions include patients suspected of poor compliance and those taking a cocktail of AEDs that are likely to interact with one another.
Clobazam (CLB). The structure of CLB (1,5-benzodiazepine) differs slightly from those of clonazepam (CZP) and diazepam (1,4-benzodiazepines), which may account for the lower propensity of CLB to produce sedation.
Indications. CLB is a useful adjunctive drug for drug-resistant partial and generalized seizures. Recent studies have supported its efficacy for children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
Dosage. CLB is administered once or twice daily, preferably at bedtime, in a dosage range of 10-60 mg depending on efficacy and tolerability. Twice-daily administration is preferred for doses exceeding 30 mg.
Short-term administration (exempli gratia 20 mg daily for 3 days) can be an effective strategy in women with premenstrual seizure exacerbations and for other patients as 'cover' for holidays or stressful events, such as weddings and surgery. A single dose of 10-30 mg can have a useful prophylactic action if taken immediately after the first event in patients who regularly suffer clusters of complex partial and secondary generalized seizures. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome should be given 0.5-2 mg/kg/day.
Not all responders will maintain a worthwhile improvement in seizure control on long-term dosing owing to the development of tolerance. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (10-20%) of patients treated with CLB become seizure free. Intermittent use of CLB reduces the likelihood of tolerance.
Side effects. As already mentioned, CLB is less likely to cause sedation than the 1,4-benzodiazepines. Nevertheless, depression, irritability and tiredness have been reported. As with barbiturates, deterioration in behavior and mood disturbance can occur, particularly in patients with learning disabilities; CLB should probably be avoided in such patients.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. CLB is biotransformed in the liver to a number of metabolites, including an active metabolite N -desmethylclobazam. Comedication with enzyme-inducing AEDs increases the metabolism of CLB, and hence the N -desmethylclobazam level. The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established.
Clonazepam (CZP), like other benzodiazepines, enhances inhibition mediated through gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
Indications. CZP is primarily used as adjunctive treatment for generalized seizures such as absence, myoclonic and atonic seizures. It is also effective against partial and tonic-clonic seizures. Parenteral CZP can be used for status epilepticus.
Dosage. Adults should be started on 0.5-1.0 mg daily with subsequent weekly increments as necessary. In children, 0.5 mg daily is the usual starting dose. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect and difficulty weaning patients off CZP limit its clinical value.
Side effects are prominent, usually dose limiting, and include sedation, ataxia and behavioral changes, such as depression.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. Drug interactions of CZP are minimal, although its half-life in adults can be slightly reduced from 17-56 hours (as monotherapy) to 12-46 hours in the presence of an enzyme-inducing AED.
Ethosuximide (ESM) was introduced in 1958. It works by reducing T-type calcium currents in thalamic neurons.
Indications. Since its introduction, ESM has been the drug of choice for children with absence seizures who do not also have tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizures. ESM is also effective for atypical absences, but ineffective for myoclonic, tonic-clonic and partial-onset seizures.
Dosage. In children and adults, dosing is initiated with 500 mg daily (250 mg daily in children under 6 years of age), with 250-mg dose increments as clinically indicated over 2-3 weeks to the maximum tolerated amount, which is typically 15-30 mg/kg once or twice daily in children and 20-40 mg/kg given in two divided doses in adults. Serum concentrations less than 40 mg/liter are usually ineffective.
Side effects occur in approximately 40% of patients and predominantly relate to the gastrointestinal tract (hiccups, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia). Headache, dizziness, drowsiness and unsteadiness may also occur. Allergic rashes are seen in up to 5% of patients. A transient leukopenia has been described.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. The metabolism of ESM is hepatic, protein binding is minimal and drug interactions are not a major problem.
Phenobarbital (PB), synthesized in 1911, is the oldest AED in common clinical use. It enhances the effect of GABA by prolonging chloride channel opening at the GABA A receptor, resulting in neuronal hyperpolarization.
Indications. Once widely prescribed for partial and tonic-clonic seizures, PB has been relegated to second-line therapy in some countries because it causes sedation and behavioral problems. Nevertheless, the drug appears to be effective and well tolerated in experience from developing countries. Indeed, on a global scale PB remains one of the most important AEDs because of its low cost and continuing widespread use in the developing world and in many industrialized countries. The parenteral formulation is occasionally useful as adjunctive therapy in SE. PB may also be used for myoclonic seizures.
Dosage. In children, doses of 2-5 mg/kg daily are usually necessary for optimal seizure control. Resulting serum concentrations typically range from 15 to 40 mg/liter. Maintenance doses in adults range from 60 to 240 mg/day. Tapering should be attempted slowly (exempli gratia 15 mg/month) to minimize the possibility of withdrawal seizures and other undesirable symptoms, such as altered mood and sleep disturbance.
Side effects. As mentioned above, PB often causes sedation and behavioral problems, such as depression and agitation. In addition, it may cause hyperactivity in children and elderly patients. Recent data suggest an increased risk of fetal abnormalities in infants exposed to the drug during the first trimester of pregnancy. Other problems include allergic rash, osteoporosis, folate deficiency and Dupuytren's contracture.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. The half-life of PB is 4 days. Consequently, steady-state serum concentrations may not be reached for up to 3 weeks after a change in dose. PB is metabolized in the liver, and is a powerful inducer of hepatic metabolism, accelerating the clearance of many other lipid-soluble drugs.
Phenytoin (PHT). The discovery and clinical testing of PHT by Merritt and Putnam in the 1930s introduced both a major new non-sedating AED and an animal model of epilepsy (electrical seizures in the cat). Like CBZ, PHT blocks voltage-dependent neuronal sodium channels.
Indications. For the past 80 years, PHT has been a first-line medication for the prevention of partial and tonic-clonic seizures and for the acute treatment of seizures and SE, although it is more often used as a second-line agent in children. PHT is not effective against myoclonic, atonic and absence seizures. It is available in oral and intravenous forms.
Dosage. Depending on the urgency of the situation, PHT may be started at the maintenance dose, typically 300 mg daily as a single dose or in two divided doses in adults (5-8 mg/kg daily in children), or at a higher dose, such as 20 mg/kg divided into three oral doses over 24 hours or 20 mg/kg given intravenously - no faster than 50 mg/minute. The dose should be increased at 1-2 weekly increments as necessary and as tolerated. Most adults usually achieve satisfactory seizure control with once-daily dosing. Patients with erratic compliance should be treated twice daily to lessen the effect of a missed dose.
Side effects can be divided into neurotoxic symptoms (ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, asterixis, somnolence) that typically present 8-12 hours after an oral dose, chronic dysmorphic effects (gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, acne, facial coarsening) that occur after months of therapy, and uncommon long-term problems (folate deficiency, osteopenia, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar atrophy) that take years to develop. PHT is associated with rash in approximately 5% of patients. Other rare idiosyncratic reactions include Stevens-Johnson syndrome, hepatitis, bone-marrow suppression, lymphadenopathy and a lupus-like syndrome. PHT may also be a teratogen.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. PHT is metabolized in the liver. The first step of this process involves the enzyme arene oxidase, which has saturable kinetics, particularly at moderate-to-high serum concentrations. The concentration at which PHT pharmacokinetics become non-linear varies as a function of age. As a consequence of this pharmacokinetic profile, small changes in dosing may result in disproportionate changes in serum concentration (Figure 5.3). In all patients, the dose should be increased or decreased in 25-50 mg increments when clinically indicated, particularly when serum concentrations exceed 10 mg/liter. Serum concentrations should then be checked after 1-2 weeks.
PHT induces hepatic enzymes and may, therefore, reduce serum concentrations of metabolized AEDs such as CBZ, VPA, lamotrigine (LTG), PER and topiramate (TPM). The effectiveness of other lipid-soluble drugs, including oral contraceptives and anticoagulants, is also jeopardized. PHT is tightly bound to circulating albumin and may be displaced by other drugs; some of these, such as VPA, also inhibit the metabolism of PHT. Checking free PHT serum concentrations may be useful clinically to correlate with a patient's possible neurotoxic symptoms in the setting of hypoalbuminemia, renal and hepatic insufficiency, or pregnancy. Febrile illness may increase the clearance of PHT, resulting in lowered serum concentrations. Enteral feeding has been reported to decrease PHT absorption.
Fosphenytoin is a phosphate ester prodrug of PHT that can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. It is water soluble and can be given more rapidly than intravenous PHT, with fewer local side effects. Although more expensive, fosphenytoin is better tolerated than parenteral PHT and may replace the latter in the standard treatment of SE (see Chapter 7).
Primidone (PRM) is metabolized in the liver to PB and another active substance, phenylethylmalonamide. It is not fully understood how much of a role the latter plays in the overall antiepileptic effect of PRM.
Indications. PRM is effective against partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, but appeared to be inferior to CBZ and PHT in clinical trials, largely because of its relatively poor tolerability (see below). Therefore, it is primarily used as adjunctive therapy.
Dosage. Dosing should be started with 125 mg at bedtime, increasing by 125 mg every 3-5 days as tolerated to 500-1500 mg daily in two or three divided doses. As with PB, discontinuation of PRM should be very gradual.
Side effects. PRM has a higher incidence of side effects than CBZ, PHT and PB, particularly sedation and ataxia. Decreased libido or impotence associated with PRM use has been reported.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. As its half-life is shorter than that of PB, concentrations of PB are usually higher than those of PRM. Like PB, PRM is a powerful enzyme inducer.
Sodium valproate (VPA). The anticonvulsant property of VPA was recognized serendipitously in 1963 when it was used by Pierre Eymard as a solvent for a number of other compounds. VPA exerts its antiepileptic property, at least in part, by limiting sustained repetitive firing by a use- and voltage-dependent effect on sodium channels. It also facilitates the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.
Indications. VPA is now established as effective over the complete range of seizure types, with particular value in the idiopathic generalized epilepsies.
Dosage. The starting dose for adults and adolescents should be 500 mg once or twice daily. Alterations thereafter can be made according to the clinical status of the patient. Divalproex sodium (a combination of valproic acid and VPA) can also be given twice daily. As the drug can take several weeks to become fully effective, frequent dose adjustments shortly after therapy is started may be unwarranted. Because VPA does not exhibit a clear-cut concentration-effect-toxicity relationship and daily variations in concentration at a given dose are wide, routine monitoring is unhelpful unless closely correlated with the patient's clinical situation. A few patients need and tolerate serum concentrations up to 150 mg/liter.
Side effects. Unpleasant or distressing side effects include dose-related tremor, weight gain due to appetite stimulation, thinning or loss of hair (usually temporary) and menstrual irregularities including amenorrhea. Some young women develop polycystic ovary syndrome associated with obesity and hirsutism. Rarely, stupor and encephalopathy associated with hyperammonemia can occur. The insidious development of parkinsonism has also been reported, although this effect reverses on VPA withdrawal. Hepatotoxicity, histologically a microvesicular steatosis similar to that found in Reye's syndrome, affects fewer than 1 in 20 000 exposed individuals. This appears to be a particular concern in children under 3 years of age receiving AED polypharmacy, some of whom will have a coexistent metabolic defect. Other sporadic problems include thrombocytopenia and acute pancreatitis.
An important concern in women of childbearing potential is an increased dose-dependent risk of major malformations in offspring exposed to VPA during the first trimester of pregnancy. Data from prospective pregnancy registries suggest the risk may be more than 10%, including an estimated 1-3% risk of neural tube defects, at high dosage (> 1000 mg daily). Women of childbearing potential should not be started on VPA without specialist neurological advice. High-dose VPA has also been linked to cognitive impairment in children who were exposed to the drug in utero.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. VPA can inhibit a range of hepatic metabolic processes, including oxidation, conjugation and epoxidation reactions. Targets include other AEDs, particularly PHT, PB, the active epoxide metabolite of CBZ, and LTG. VPA does not, however, interfere with the hormonal components of the oral contraceptive pill.
Modern antiepileptic drugs
After a hiatus of nearly 20 years, 16 new AEDs and two devices - the vagus nerve stimulator and deep brain stimulator - have received licenses for the adjunctive treatment of refractory epilepsy, the last so far only in Europe. Gabapentin (GBP), lacosamide (LCM), LTG, levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC), pregabalin (PGB), tiagabine (TGB), TPM and zonisamide (ZNS) are widely available for partial seizures. Rufinamide (RFN) has been licensed in Europe and the USA for adjunctive treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is licensed in Europe as adjunctive treatment for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. Retigabine (RTG; ezogabine in the USA) and perampanel (PER) have recently been approved for use in Europe and the USA for the same indication. After 20 years of global experience, vigabatrin (VGB) has been approved in the USA for the treatment of infantile spasms and as add-on therapy for drug-resistant complex partial seizures. However, the use of VGB has also been markedly restricted because of reports of concentric visual field defects in up to 40% of patients. Stiripentol (STP) was licensed in 2001 for the adjunctive treatment of Dravet syndrome in Europe via the orphan drugs system. A similar arrangement has taken place in the USA for CLB in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This drug has been available elsewhere in the world since the 1970s. The progress of felbamate (FBM) has been dramatically curtailed because of the unusual development of idiosyncratic life-threatening bone-marrow and liver toxicities. The advent of these newer agents has provided many more options in the management of refractory epilepsy, although whether overall outcomes have improved substantially is debatable.
Some of these AEDs - LEV, LTG, GBP, OXC and TPM - have also demonstrated efficacy as monotherapies in newly diagnosed epilepsy and have received approval for this indication in some countries. The pharmacological properties of these newer AEDs are highlighted in Table 5.4. Dosing information in adults and children is summarized in Tables 5.5 and 5.6, respectively.
Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is a third-generation novel voltage-gated sodium-channel blocker. It is a pro-drug that is rapidly biotransformed to the (S)-entantiomer of licarbazepine. ESL is structurally similar to CBZ, but it is not metabolized to the active epoxide metabolite, which contributes to the latter's side-effect profile. Its precise mechanism of action is unknown, but it is thought to selectively target rapidly firing neurons by binding to site 2 of the inactive sodium channel.
Indications. ESL has been approved in Europe as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients 18 years of age or older. ESL tends to be better tolerated than CBZ with a lower potential for allergic rash and hyponatremia.
Dosage. The recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily, increasing usually to 800 mg once daily after 1 or 2 weeks, thus offering fast titration. The dose can be titrated further to 1200 mg once daily. Limited safety information is available for patients over 65 years of age. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild-to-moderate renal or hepatic impairment.
Side effects. ESL is generally well tolerated. The commonest side effects are dizziness and somnolence. Other complaints during clinical trials have included headache, abnormal coordination, disturbed attention, tremor, diplopia, blurred vision, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rash. Patients taking CBZ and ESL in placebo-controlled studies tended to report diplopia, abnormal coordination and dizziness more often than with other combinations. Hyponatremia occurs less frequently with ESL than with CBZ and much less frequently than with OXC.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. The effective steady-state half-life of ESL is 20-24 hours, which is longer than the single-dose half-life of 13-20 hours, allowing once-daily dosing. Peak plasma levels are reached after 1-4 hours and steady-state concentrations are attained in 4-5 days. Coadministration of ESL with PHT results in reduced ESL concentrations with increased PHT levels. Hence, the dosage of PHT may need adjustment if these drugs are used in combination. Like CBZ and OXC, ESL demonstrates an interaction with the combined oral contraceptive, accelerating the clearance of both hormonal components.
Felbamate (FBM) potentiates GABA activity and blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels as well as the ion channel at the N -methyl- d -aspartate excitatory amino-acid receptor.
Indications. FBM has demonstrated effectiveness both as monotherapy and add-on therapy for partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients 14 years of age or older. It also has important efficacy as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial and generalized seizures (including atonic seizures) associated with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children.
Dosage. Dosing should be initiated slowly and titrated over several weeks to minimize side effects. Doses of 1800-4800 mg daily in adults and 15-45 mg/kg daily in children are usually necessary for optimal seizure control. Routine monitoring of liver and bone-marrow function is recommended, but will not fully predict potentially fatal toxicity.
Side effects include insomnia, headache, nausea, anorexia, somnolence, vomiting, weight loss and dizziness. Clinical experience with FBM subsequent to its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) showed a notable incidence of aplastic anemia and hepatotoxicity. As a result, the use of FBM is now largely restricted to patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome for whom the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. In total, 25% of FBM is bound to plasma protein and approximately 50% is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Its half-life ranges from 15 to 24 hours. FBM increases serum concentrations of PHT, VPA and CBZ epoxide. Thus, dose adjustment of concomitant AEDs is usually necessary when FBM is introduced.
Gabapentin (GBP) was developed by adding a cyclohexyl group to GABA, which allowed it to cross the blood-brain barrier. Despite its structure, GBP does not bind to GABA receptors in the CNS. It appears to work by binding to the alpha δ subunit of the neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels, inhibiting calcium flow and neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons.
Indications. GBP is approved as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients 12 years of age or older. It has also been licensed as monotherapy for these types of seizures in some countries. It may exacerbate myoclonic jerks and generalized absences. In addition, GBP is a useful drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
Dosage. Dosing should be initiated at 300 mg or 400 mg a day and increased in 300-mg or 400-mg increments every 1-3 days to the maximum tolerated dose using a thrice-daily regimen. The recommended dose range is 1200-2400 mg daily (900-1800 mg daily in the USA). However, many patients with drug-resistant epilepsy will need higher amounts (up to 4800 mg daily) for optimal seizure control.
Side effects are generally mild and transient. Drowsiness, ataxia, dizziness and nystagmus are the most common. Weight gain occurs in up to 5% of patients, particularly at higher doses. Flatulence, diarrhea and myoclonic jerks have also been reported. No idiosyncratic reactions or effects on bone marrow or hepatic function have been described.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. GBP is not metabolized in the liver, and it neither induces nor inhibits hepatic enzymes. Drug interactions, therefore, are not an issue with this agent. Its half-life is 6-9 hours. GBP is eliminated unchanged by the kidneys, so patients with renal insufficiency need lower doses and less frequent dosing. A useful serum concentration range has not been established.
Lacosamide (LCM) is a member of a group of functionalized amino acids synthesized to harness their anticonvulsant properties. Evidence suggests that the drug exerts its antiepileptic effect in a novel way - by enhancing the slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels.
Indications. LCM is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients aged 16 years and older (17 years and older in the USA).
Dosage. The recommended starting dose is 50 mg twice daily, which should be increased to 100 mg twice daily after 1 week for maintenance. The maximum recommended dose is 200 mg twice daily (400 mg daily), although doses up to 600 mg daily have demonstrated efficacy in placebo-controlled clinical trials. LCM is also available as a syrup and intravenous injection. No dosage adjustment is needed in the elderly or in patients with mild-to-moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Outcomes with LCM may be better in patients treated with other AEDs that do not have a major pharmacological effect on sodium channels.
Side effects. Common problems include dizziness, headache, diplopia and nausea. Other reported adverse effects include vomiting, fatigue, blurred vision, poor coordination, somnolence, tremor and nystagmus. Minor prolongation in the PR interval has been observed in clinical studies and so LCM is contraindicated in patients with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block. The tablet form contains soy-derived lecithin in the coating, which may be a concern for some individuals with soy or peanut allergies.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. Oral LCM is completely absorbed with an elimination half-life of around 13 hours. Of the total dose, 40% is excreted unchanged in the urine. LCM does not inhibit or induce hepatic metabolic enzymes. There are no interactions, therefore, between LCM and the hormonal components of the oral contraceptive pill. Enzyme inducers such as PHT, PB, CBZ, rifampicin and St John's wort may reduce LCM concentrations.
Lamotrigine (LTG) selectively blocks the slow inactivated state of the sodium channel, thereby preventing the release of excitatory amino-acid neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate and aspartate. This mode of action does not explain its anti-absence and anti-myoclonic properties.
Indications. LTG appears to be effective across the complete range of seizure types, including partial seizures, the idiopathic generalized epilepsies and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It is licensed widely as add-on treatment for adults with drug-resistant epilepsy. Its use in children and as monotherapy in newly diagnosed epilepsy has been approved in a growing number of countries. Good results have been reported in patients with learning disabilities, who often have multiple seizure types. The ability of LTG to reduce interictal spiking may explain the improved alertness reported by some people taking the drug. Its efficacy may be enhanced when combined with VPA, although this combination is associated with higher rates of rash, tremor and teratogenesis. LTG may exacerbate myoclonic seizures in some patients, particularly those with severe myoclonic epilepsy. It is less effective than ESM and VPA for the treatment of children with typical absence only, without generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS).
Dosage. LTG can be administered once daily as monotherapy or with VPA, or twice daily in patients taking enzyme-inducing AEDs. A low starting dose with a slow titration schedule will reduce the risk of rash, though this depends on concomitant medication (Table 5.7). Some patients respond to and tolerate doses exceeding 600 mg daily as monotherapy, or above 800 mg daily in combination with an enzyme-inducing AED. An equivalent high dose in VPA-treated patients would be 150-200 mg daily because of the extent of metabolic inhibition. A once-daily controlled-release formulation is now available in the USA.
Side effects include headache, nausea, insomnia, vomiting, dizziness, diplopia, ataxia and tremor. The drug seldom causes sedation. Rash complicates initial management in around 3% of patients taking LTG as monotherapy, and in 8% of those already established on VPA. It is usually maculopapular and, in mild cases, may subside spontaneously without drug withdrawal. In a few patients, however, there is an accompanying systemic illness with malaise, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia. Cases of bullous erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported. The risk of a severe skin reaction may be as high as 1 in 1000 adults and 1 in 100 children. Gradual introduction of LTG lessens the likelihood of rash, so adherence to the prescribing guidelines should be strict. Preliminary results from large-scale pregnancy registries suggest only a small, dose-dependent risk of major fetal malformation associated with LTG monotherapy (4.5% with doses exceeding 300 mg daily). This risk may be considerably higher (up to 11%) when the drug is given with VPA.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. LTG does not influence the metabolism of lipid-soluble drugs, including other AEDs and warfarin. Co-prescription with the oral contraceptive pill results in reduction in the concentration of LTG and levonorgestrel. When used as monotherapy, the half-life of LTG approximates 24 hours. When it is given to patients already being treated with the enzyme-inducing agents CBZ, PHT or PB, the half-life falls to about 15 hours. VPA inhibits glucuronidation of LTG, prolonging its half-life to around 60 hours. Withdrawal of enzyme-inducing AEDs, therefore, causes a rise in the circulating concentrations of LTG, while discontinuing VPA produces a fall.
Serum concentrations of LTG fall dramatically during pregnancy, in patients starting an estrogen-containing oral contraceptive and in women just before the onset of menses. In these circumstances, concentration monitoring may be helpful in guiding LTG dose adjustment.
A pharmacodynamic interaction resulting in symptoms of neurotoxicity (headache, dizziness, nausea, diplopia, ataxia) is a common consequence when LTG is introduced in patients established on high-dose CBZ or OXC. This effect can be reduced by staggering doses of CBZ or OXC and LTG by 2-3 hours instead of administering them simultaneously. A pharmacodynamic interaction has also been proposed as the explanation for the marked tremor seen in some patients taking VPA and LTG in combination.
Levetiracetam (LEV) is an enantiomer of the ethyl analog of piracetam. It binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and releases a range of neurotransmitters.
Indications. LEV is approved for use in adults and in children aged 4 years and older. It has proven efficacy for drug-resistant partial seizures and a variety of generalized seizure types, including myoclonic jerks. It is licensed as initial monotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy in Europe but not in the USA. A controlled-release formulation is available in the USA but not in Europe. An intravenous formulation has also been licensed in the USA for use in adults and in Europe for patients aged 4 years and older when oral administration is temporarily not feasible, such as immediately before, during and after surgery.
Dosage. In controlled studies, patients with partial seizures responded to 1000-3000 mg daily. Daily doses of up to 4000 mg appear to be well tolerated. Treatment can be initiated at 250-500 mg twice daily and titrated in 1000-mg increments every 2 weeks as tolerated and needed for seizure control. Seizures in some patients will be controlled on doses as low as 250 mg twice daily. Urinary excretion of unchanged drug accounts for approximately 60% of an administered dose, so patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment will need lower amounts given at longer intervals.
Side effects. LEV is generally well tolerated. The most common side effect is sleepiness or somnolence. Some patients complain of headache, anorexia and nervousness. Behavioral problems such as agitation, aggression, emotional lability, hostility, psychosis, anxiety and depression are not uncommon, particularly in patients with a history of learning disability. The patient and family should be warned about the possibility of aggression, particularly if the patient has a history of learning disability or dementia. The risk of behavioral side effects may be reduced by adopting a slower titration schedule. Idiosyncratic skin rash with LEV has been rarely reported. Early data suggest that this drug may be safe in pregnancy.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. The major metabolic pathway for LEV is hydrolysis of the acetamide group to the inactive carboxylic derivative. Because its metabolism is independent of the hepatic CYP system, it has no clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs, including oral contraceptives. Steady state is achieved after 2 days of twice-daily dosing. Children clear LEV faster than adults. In young adults, the half-life is 7-8 hours, compared with 10-11 hours in the healthy elderly, who have age-related diminished renal function.
Oxcarbazepine (OXC), the 10-keto analog of CBZ, is licensed worldwide. It is functionally a prodrug, being rapidly reduced in the liver to the active metabolite 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine. Principally, it prevents burst firing of neurons by blocking sodium channels, but it also modulates calcium and potassium currents.
Indications. OXC has a similar spectrum of efficacy to CBZ against partial and tonic-clonic seizures. It tends to be better tolerated than CBZ with fewer neurotoxic side effects.
Dosage. The recommended starting dose for OXC in adults is 150-600 mg daily in two doses. The dose can be titrated upwards as clinically indicated to 3000-4000 mg daily. A starting dose of 5 mg/kg daily in children over 3 years of age can be prescribed, increasing gradually to a maintenance dose of about 30 mg/kg daily. Patients already on CBZ may be switched immediately to OXC using a dosage ratio of 1.5 OXC to 1 CBZ. Particular care in immediate switching needs to be taken when the daily CBZ dose exceeds 1200 mg. Plasma concentrations of the clinically active metabolite of OXC increase linearly with dose. No studies, however, have attempted to relate elevated plasma levels to efficacy or toxicity.
Side effects most often involve the CNS and include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, diplopia, nausea, vomiting and ataxia. Rash occurs less frequently with OXC than with CBZ, but like CBZ, OXC has been implicated in rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. OXC does not appear to produce blood dyscrasias or hepatotoxicity. Hyponatremia, which may be due to an antidiuretic hormone-like effect, is somewhat more common with OXC than with CBZ, although affected patients are rarely symptomatic unless the serum sodium level dips below 125 mmol/liter. There is no evidence that OXC is a human teratogen, although high doses produce malformations in rodents.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. OXC has no effect on its own metabolism, but it induces a single isoform of CYP, resulting in accelerated clearance of the hormonal components of the oral contraceptive pill.
Perampanel (PER) is a unique, highly selective, non-competitive antagonist of the ionotropic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor on postsynaptic neurons. Activation of AMPA receptors by glutamate is thought to be responsible for most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. However, the precise mechanism by which perampanel exerts its antiseizure effects in humans has yet to be fully elucidated.
PER is licensed as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients with epilepsy aged 12 years and older.
Dosage. PER is taken once daily. Treatment should be initiated with a single dose of 2 mg/day at bedtime. The dosage may be increased, depending on clinical response and tolerability, by increments of 2 mg/day to a maintenance dosage of 4-8 mg/day. Some patients will respond to and tolerate as much as 12 mg/day. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal and hepatic impairment. PER should be used with caution in elderly patients because only limited clinical data are available in this population.
Side effects. The adverse reactions most commonly leading to discontinuation in the regulatory trial program were dizziness and somnolence. Other reported side effects included nausea, diplopia, ataxia, vertigo, headache, decreased and increased appetite, fatigue, gait disturbance and falls. Psychiatric disorders such as aggression, anger, anxiety and confusion were also rarely reported.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. PER undergoes rapid absorption with near optimal bioavailability. The drug has a long elimination half-life, averaging around 105 hours. Although the exact metabolic pathway of PER is still being elucidated, the drug appears to undergo oxidation by hepatic CYP3A4 with subsequent glucuronidation. Accordingly, its metabolism is induced by PHT, CBZ and OXC, so drug dosing may need to be higher in patients who are also taking these AEDs. In particular, CBZ can increase PER clearance by up to threefold. PER does not seem to affect the metabolism of other AEDs.
At high dosage PER decreases levanorgestrol but not ethinylestradiol exposure. Therefore, the possibility of decreased efficacy of progesterone-containing oral contraceptives should be considered in women established on PER, 12 mg/day. The antifungal agent ketoconazole has been shown to prolong the elimination half-life of PER by around 15%.
Pregabalin (PGB) has an amino-acid configuration and is structurally related to GABA. Like GBP, it binds with high affinity to the alpha δ subunit of neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels.
Indications. PGB is licensed as adjunctive treatment for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. It is also approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain and, outside the USA, generalized anxiety disorder.
Dosage. The recommended starting amount is 50-150 mg daily in two to three divided doses. The maximum dose used in regulatory trials is 600 mg daily, which can be prescribed as 300 mg twice daily or 200 mg three times daily.
Side effects include dizziness, somnolence, asthenia, headache and ataxia. Many patients experience weight gain, particularly at high PGB doses. Peripheral edema has also been noted occasionally.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. The absorption of PGB is rapid, linear and almost complete. The short elimination half-life of 6-8 hours led to the use of twice- and thrice-daily dosing in clinical trials. PGB is excreted unchanged by the kidney and displays no pharmacokinetic interactions with any other drug, including all AEDs. Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with substantial renal failure and in those maintained on hemodialysis.
Retigabine (RTG)/ezogabine (EZG) is a first-in-class potassium channel opener for the treatment of adults with partial epilepsy. The adopted name for the drug in the USA is ezogabine with retigabine being used across the rest of the world.
Indications. RTG/EZG is licensed as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults aged 18 years and over.
Dosage. RTG/EZG is taken in three divided daily doses. The maximum starting dose is 300 mg (100 mg three times daily). Thereafter the total daily dose can be increased, as clinically indicated, by a maximum 150 mg every week according to individual patient response and tolerability. The effective maintenance dose is 600-1200 mg daily in most patients. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild renal and hepatic impairment, but lower doses are recommended in patients with more severe organ dysfunction.
Side effects. A dose-response relationship seems to exist for dizziness, somnolence, tremor, gait disturbance, diplopia and constipation. Confusion, psychosis and hallucinations have also been reported in clinical trials. RTG/EZG has shown no consistent effect on bladder function, but hesitation, dysuria and, very occasionally, urinary retention have been reported in association with RTG/EZG administration. Caution is advised when RTG/EZG is prescribed in patients with a prolonged QT interval or in those taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval; in such patients it is recommended that an electrocardiogram be recorded before treatment is initiated.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. RTG/EZG exhibits linear kinetics with a bioavailability of around 60%. Its elimination half-life approximates 8 hours, supporting thrice-daily administration. RTG/EZG does not induce or inhibit its own metabolism. PHT and CBZ will increase its clearance by around 30%. Population kinetics show no clinically relevant interaction with other AEDs. RTG/EZG does not alter the metabolism of the hormonal components of the oral contraceptive pill. Its administration may increase serum digoxin concentration.
Rufinamide (RFN) is a triazole derivative that reduces the recovery capacity of neuronal sodium channels after inactivation, thereby limiting action potential firing. Other unknown mechanisms of action are also likely given the drug's broad-spectrum antiepileptic properties.
Indications. RFN is licensed widely as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients aged 4 years and older. Particular benefit has been demonstrated in reducing tonic-atonic seizures ('drop attacks'). The drug also may have efficacy in drug-resistant partial seizures with or without secondary generalization although it is not licensed for this indication.
Dosage. The initial daily dose in children weighing less than 30 kg and not receiving VPA is 200 mg in two divided doses. This can be increased by 200-mg daily increments to a maximum of 1000 mg daily. Children weighing under 30 kg who are also receiving VPA should have the same starting dose, but with a reduced maximum maintenance amount of 400 mg daily. Older or heavier children and adults should be started on 200 mg twice daily, increasing as necessary to a maximum dose of 3200 mg daily. The formulation can be crushed and administered with half a glass of water.
Side effects. The most common adverse events reported during the clinical development program were headache, dizziness, fatigue and somnolence. Less common problems were nausea, vomiting, anxiety, insomnia and weight gain. Hypersensitivity reactions with fever, rash and lymphadenopathy are rare. Status epilepticus was reported during the clinical trial program.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. RFN is extensively absorbed with an elimination half-life of 6-10 hours. It undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily via hydrolysis, with little involvement of the CYP system. RFN concentrations are decreased by coadministration of CBZ, PHT, PB and PRM. Significant increases in RFN plasma levels can occur when the drug is given with VPA. RFN may reduce the clearance and hence increase the circulating concentrations of PHT. RFN has no clinically relevant effects on the levels of PB, CBZ, LTG, VPA or TPM. It does, however, induce the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and norethisterone, common components of the combined oral contraceptive pill.
Stiripentol (STP) enhances central GABAergic neurotransmission by increasing GABA release, thereby prolonging the inhibitory effect of GABA.
Indications. STP has been licensed via the European orphan drug system as an adjunctive treatment for severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet syndrome).
Dosage. The dose advised for children is 50 mg/kg/day given two or three times daily, preferably during meals, and increased as necessary to a maximum daily amount of 3500 mg. It is available as 250-mg and 500-mg capsules and sachets for an oral suspension.
Side effects. The most frequently reported adverse events in the clinical trials were drowsiness, slowing of mental function, ataxia, diplopia, anorexia, weight loss, nausea and abdominal pain. Asymptomatic neutropenia was occasionally observed.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. The bioavailability of STP is low and the drug undergoes saturation kinetics at therapeutic doses. Its effectiveness during adjunctive therapy probably depends on its inhibition of the hepatic metabolism of other AEDs, including PHT, CBZ, PB, VPA and CLB. A reduction of the dose of concomitant therapy, particularly CBZ and CLB, is often necessary, sometimes by as much as 50%.
Tiagabine (TGB) selectively inhibits the neuronal and glial reuptake of GABA, and thereby enhances GABA-mediated inhibition (Figure 5.4).
Indications. TGB is licensed globally for use as add-on therapy in drug-resistant partial epilepsy.
Dosage. TGB is available as 5-mg, 10-mg and 15-mg tablets, except in the USA, Canada and Mexico where 2-mg, 4-mg, 12-mg, 16-mg and 20-mg tablets of TGB are produced. Studies suggest a minimal effective dose of around 20-30 mg/day as add-on therapy in partial epilepsy. The dose range most extensively studied has been 32-56 mg/day, but some patients have demonstrated benefit with up to 80 mg daily. Treatment in adults is started with 4-5 mg once or twice daily, followed by weekly increments of 4-5 mg. A change to three-times-daily dosing is recommended when 30 mg or more is prescribed daily. TGB should be taken with food to avoid rapid rises in plasma concentration. Routine monitoring of plasma levels is not required.
Side effects include dizziness, asthenia, nervousness, tremor, impaired concentration, lethargy and depression. Weakness due to transient loss of tone can occur at high doses. The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy are confusion, somnolence, ataxia and dizziness. In clinical trials, TGB-treated patients experienced similar rates of occurrence for rash and psychosis as those taking placebo. The safety of TGB in pregnancy is unknown, but it is not teratogenic in animals at therapeutic doses. Absence stupor and non-convulsive SE have been reported as rare side effects; these generally respond to treatment with benzodiazepines.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. TGB is rapidly and completely absorbed. Food reduces the rate, but not the extent, of absorption. It is extensively metabolized by hepatic oxidization via the CYP isoenzyme CYP3A. Because TGB does not induce or inhibit liver enzymes, concentrations of CBZ, PHT, theophylline, warfarin and digoxin are unaffected. VPA levels may drop slightly by an unknown mechanism. The half-life of TGB is 5-9 hours, falling to 2-4 hours when the drug is coadministered with hepatic-enzyme-inducing AEDs, such as CBZ and PHT. TGB shows linear pharmacokinetics that do not vary greatly in the elderly. Lower doses are required in patients with substantial hepatic, but not renal, impairment.
Topiramate (TPM) is a sulfamate-substituted monosaccharide that has multiple pharmacological actions involving blockade of sodium channels and high-voltage-activated calcium channels, attenuation of kainate-induced responses and enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. It also inhibits carbonic anhydrase, an effect that contributes to its side-effect profile.
Indications. TPM has proven efficacy against partial and tonic-clonic seizures. It also seems effective in myoclonic epilepsies, including some of the more severe syndromes of childhood. A useful effect on generalized absences has yet to be shown. However, it can provide benefit to patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and possibly also infantile spasms. TPM has similar effectiveness to CBZ or VPA as monotherapy for partial and generalized seizures, and has received a monotherapy indication in some countries for newly diagnosed epilepsy. In addition to its indication for the treatment of epilepsy, TPM is also approved for migraine prophylaxis.
Dosage. Patients respond to TPM in doses ranging from 50 to 1000 mg daily. It is administered in two divided doses and should be introduced slowly. An initial dose of 25-50 mg daily can be increased by 25-50 mg every 1-2 weeks until a maximally effective and/or tolerated dose is achieved. The optimum dose for most patients with drug-resistant epilepsy appears to be 200-400 mg twice daily. Higher doses (400-800 mg daily) may be required in patients taking PHT or CBZ, with lower amounts (100-200 mg) often being successful in those taking non-enzyme-inducing AEDs. Some patients respond to doses as low as 50-100 mg daily, particularly if TPM is combined with LTG. Concentration monitoring of TPM is unnecessary. However, measurement of PHT levels may be necessary in patients who develop symptoms suggestive of toxicity. Women taking an oral contraceptive should use a formulation containing at least 50 µg of ethinylestradiol if the daily dose of TPM exceeds 200 mg.
Side effects related to the CNS include ataxia, poor concentration, confusion, dysphasia, dizziness, fatigue, paresthesia, somnolence, word-finding difficulties and cognitive slowing. The risk of neurocognitive side effects can be minimized by titrating the dose slowly. Anorexia and weight loss are common accompaniments of TPM therapy. It increases the risk of nephrolithiasis tenfold and so should be avoided in patients with a history of kidney stones and in those taking calcium supplements or high-dose vitamin C. Sweating may be reduced in some children, leading to elevated body temperature. Acute glaucoma has been reported. TPM has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of facial clefts.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. TPM inhibits the metabolism of PHT in about 10% of patients. When used in doses over 200 mg/day, it can accelerate the breakdown of the estrogenic component of the oral contraceptive pill. PHT and CBZ induce TPM degradation, reducing its concentration by 40% or more.
Vigabatrin (VGB). The antiepileptic effect of VGB is mediated by suicidal inhibition of GABA transaminase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolic degradation of GABA (see Figure 5.4).
Indications. VGB is an effective add-on drug for patients with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. It can worsen myoclonic jerks and generalized absences. Unfortunately, its usefulness has been severely limited by the development of visual field constriction in more than 40% of patients. This problem was first noted 8 years after the initial launch of the drug. As a result, VGB is only recommended as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures when there is no other alternative. However, VGB is still regarded by many pediatric neurologists as the treatment of choice for infantile spasms; more than 50% of children have been reported as spasm free after 1 week of treatment. Children with coexistent tuberous sclerosis often demonstrate a particularly favorable response. VGB is approved by the FDA for the treatment of infantile spasms and as add-on therapy in adults with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures.
Dosage. VGB is usually added to existing AED therapy, initially in a dose of 500 mg once or twice daily to allow tolerance to any sedation. If the patient complains of agitation or a thought disorder, the drug should be withdrawn immediately. Further increments of 500 mg or 1000 mg daily will depend on the clinical status of the patient. Seizures in most patients will respond to 2000-3000 mg daily. Few show further improvement at higher doses. Children should start treatment at 40 mg/kg daily, increased according to response up to 80-100 mg/kg daily. Infants with spasms may need as much as 150 mg/kg daily. When being discontinued, VGB should be tapered slowly, as abrupt cessation can produce a marked increase in seizures and can precipitate psychosis. Monitoring of VGB concentrations is unnecessary as the drug does not exhibit a useful concentration-effect-toxicity relationship.
Side effects. Tiredness, dizziness, headache and weight gain are the most frequent adverse effects with VGB. Some patients report a change in mood, commonly agitation, ill temper, disturbed behavior or depression. Paranoid and psychotic symptoms can develop. VGB can cause hyperkinesia and agitation in children. No idiosyncratic reactions have been reported. For patients in whom the benefit of VGB treatment is judged to outweigh the risk of visual field constriction (as discussed above), formal visual field monitoring should be performed every 6-12 months. There is no evidence that VGB is a human teratogen.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. VGB does not interfere with hepatic metabolic enzymes, but produces a small reduction in PHT levels of around 20% by an unknown mechanism.
Zonisamide (ZNS) is a sulfonamide derivative, chemically and structurally unrelated to other AEDs. It blocks voltage-dependent sodium and T-type calcium channels, and actively inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Although probably not a major contributor to its pharmacological effect, a weak inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity may contribute to its side-effect profile.
Indications. ZNS has proven efficacy for drug-resistant partial seizures. Evidence also suggests efficacy for infantile spasms and a variety of generalized seizure types, including tonic-clonic, tonic, atonic and atypical absence seizures. Pragmatic clinical studies suggest that ZNS may have important benefits in the treatment of myoclonic seizures, particularly in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and progressive myoclonic epilepsy. ZNS is licensed as monotherapy in Europe, Japan and Korea, and as adjunctive therapy elsewhere, for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization.
Dosage. The recommended initial dose for ZNS is 50-100 mg daily for adult patients, and 2 mg/kg/day for children in two divided doses. Because steady state is reached slowly, the dose should be increased at 2-week intervals to a target maintenance amount of 300-600 mg/day in adults and 4-8 mg/kg/day in children.
Side effects include anorexia, dizziness, ataxia, fatigue, somnolence, confusion and poor concentration. Gastrointestinal problems and loss of or decreased spontaneity have been described. Around 2% of treated patients develop renal stones that may resolve spontaneously. Allergic rash has also been reported particularly in patients sensitive to sulfonamides. In some children, sweating may be reduced leading to elevated body temperature. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression, aggression, anxiety and mood swings, are occasionally associated with its use.
Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. The plasma half-life of ZNS is 50-68 hours, so a steady state is achieved in about 15 days. Children require higher daily doses than adults to achieve comparable serum concentrations because of faster clearance. Patients with renal dysfunction have lower rates of clearance. Enzyme-inducing AEDs, such as PHT, CBZ and PB, decrease the half-life of ZNS by approximately 50%. ZNS itself has no effect on the metabolism of other drugs. ZNS has a high affinity for erythrocytes, and this binding is saturable; the relationship between the dose and whole-blood ZNS concentration is therefore non-linear at high doses.
Antiepileptic drug treatment guidelines
Based on the findings from randomized controlled trials, various national and international guidelines have been developed for the use of AEDs as initial monotherapy for epilepsy. These guidelines focus on efficacy and effectiveness in the process of drug selection. Among the newer AEDs, the American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society found evidence to recommend the use of GBP, LTG, OXC and TPM as monotherapies in newly diagnosed adolescents and adults with partial- or mixed-seizure disorders. In its 2006 guidelines, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) included the older AEDs but adopted a stricter set of criteria in classifying evidence, particularly in the duration of measurement of efficacy, effectiveness parameters and statistical power. As such, it only recommended CBZ, PHT (both with level A evidence) and VPA (level B) as initial monotherapies for partial-onset seizures in adults, and GBP and LTG (both level A) for partial-onset seizures in the elderly. Based on the availability of new studies, in the updated 2013 ILAE report, LEV and ZNS join CBZ and PHT with level A efﬁcacy/effectiveness evidence as initial monotherapy for adults with partial onset seizures, and both ESM and VPA now have level A efﬁcacy/effectiveness evidence as initial monotherapy for children with absence seizures. Other available guidelines include those from the UK (NICE) and Scotland (SIGN) (see Useful resources).
While these guidelines are extremely valuable in providing a working framework for the treatment of new-onset epilepsy, it is important to bear in mind that they focus on short-term evidence of efficacy and effectiveness alone. Other patient-related factors, discussed in Chapter 3, must also be considered when choosing the most appropriate treatment for the individual patient. Continuous advances in drug development also mean that these guidelines become rapidly outdated.","<BULL> Sixteen new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy since the late 1980s. <BULL> AEDs differ substantially in their mechanisms of action, spectra of activity, and pharmacokinetic and side-effect profiles. <BULL> This wider choice of AEDs permits pharmacological treatment to be better matched to the individual patient's circumstances.","s that inhibit CBZ metabolism, including GABAergic acid monoxide (GABA). The dose of GABAergic monoxide ( GABAergic monoxide) can be increased by up to 25 mg/kg. GABAergic monoxide has been shown to inhibit GABAergic monoxide and GABAergic monoxide. It is not known if GABAergic monoxide inhibits GABAergic monoxide or GABAergic monoxide, but it is known that GABAergic monoxide is a potent inhibitor of GABAergic neurotransmission. The drug has been shown to reduce GABAergic monoxide by up to 25%. GABAergic monoxide does not inhibit the GABAergic monoxide in the liver.

9781910797006,ch08,"Acute exacerbations
Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly those that result in hospitalization, place a large burden on healthcare resources. It has been estimated that, in an average UK Health Authority with a population of 250 000, there will be 14 200 consultations with a primary care physician and 680 hospital admissions for exacerbations of COPD each year. In the UK, respiratory admissions account for 25% of all acute emergency admissions, and COPD accounts for more than half of these, representing more than 200 000 hospital admissions per year. Recent studies have suggested that up to 50% of patients do not report exacerbations, so the true frequency is much higher than the number of consultations with primary care physicians suggests. Thus, the healthcare burden imposed by exacerbations of COPD is enormous. Annual costs in the USA are estimated at nearly $29.5 billion and $20.4 billion in direct and indirect costs, respectively. The comparable annual figure in the EU is €80 billion in total costs.
Since exacerbations increase in frequency and require a greater level of care as COPD progresses, most costs are incurred towards the end stage of the disease. General healthcare costs are also increased in patients with COPD, emphasizing the multisystem problems faced by this patient group.
There is no general agreement on the definition of an exacerbation of COPD. Most are based on increasing symptoms and/or increased healthcare utilization. A commonly used definition characterizes exacerbations based on the type and number of symptoms, such as increases in dyspnea, sputum volume or sputum purulence with or without symptoms of upper respiratory infection (Table 8.1). Fatigue may also be prominent.
The severity of an exacerbation can also be defined in terms of increasing healthcare utilization as: mild (self-managed by the patient at home); moderate (requiring treatment by the primary care physician and/or hospital outpatient attendance); or severe (resulting in admission to hospital). The severity of an exacerbation and the consequent healthcare utilization may depend on the severity of the underlying COPD.
Exacerbations of COPD are characterized by worsening pulmonary gas exchange and increasing hypoxemia (Table 8.2). Respiratory failure may develop in those patients with severe underlying disease or during severe exacerbations. Deterioration in gas exchange is largely due to an increased ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Hypoxemia during an exacerbation of COPD is usually due to increased areas of lung with low ventilation: perfusion ratios.
The hypercapnia of respiratory failure in some exacerbations is due to a number of factors including the increased work of breathing resulting from the increase in airways resistance and increase in systemic carbon dioxide production, and respiratory muscle fatigue. Sustained worsening is defined as symptoms worse than normal for at least 24 hours. A staging system for exacerbations of COPD using clinical descriptors to characterize acute exacerbations has been proposed (Table 8.3).
Pathology studies of exacerbations in COPD have been performed on postmortem material and bronchial biopsies. Inflammation has also been assessed by non-invasive surrogate markers in sputum and breath. Relatively few of these last studies have involved patients with COPD, and patient numbers have been small.
It has been assumed that increased inflammation in the airways is a characteristic feature of exacerbations of COPD. However, the presence of increased inflammation, and particularly the type of inflammation, is controversial and depends on whether the inflammatory response is assessed in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or bronchial biopsy, and on the severity of the exacerbation. The few studies of biopsies from patients with exacerbations of COPD have predominantly comprised patients with chronic bronchitis with mild airflow limitation; in some of these studies, increased levels of eosinophils were present in induced sputum and in bronchial biopsies from patients with exacerbations. However, neutrophils are also present in increased numbers in the bronchial walls and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in exacerbations of COPD.
Surrogate markers of inflammation, such as sputum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6, have been shown to be elevated in exacerbations of COPD. Oxidative stress is a major component of airway inflammation in COPD. Surrogate markers of oxidative stress are known to be elevated, compared with levels in healthy smokers, in the blood and exhaled breath of patients with stable COPD, and are further increased during exacerbations of COPD.
The main etiologic factors in exacerbations of COPD are thought to be bacterial and viral infections, and air pollutants. Other factors associated with exacerbations of COPD are social deprivation and changes in temperature. However, in around 30% of exacerbations of COPD, no obvious etiologic factor is found.
Bacteria. Between 30% and 50% of patients with exacerbations of COPD have a positive sputum culture for bacteria. However, around 20-30% of clinically stable patients also have a positive bacterial culture from sputum. Bronchoscopic protected specimen brush biopsies show that bacteria are present in the lower airways in greater numbers during exacerbations than in the stable clinical state, suggesting infection. The main organisms present in sputum in exacerbations of COPD are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are less common during exacerbations of COPD, but occur with increasing frequency in patients with severe airflow limitation. In some studies, atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae have been found during exacerbations of COPD. Changes in bacterial strain have also been associated with acute exacerbations.
Respiratory viruses. Several studies have shown that viruses (mainly influenza and rhinovirus) are present in around 30% of acute exacerbations of COPD. They are associated with increased inflammation in the airways and a more prolonged time to the resolution of symptoms.
Air pollution is now a well-established cause of exacerbations of COPD. Epidemiological studies show links between the levels of particulate air pollution and emergency admissions for exacerbations of COPD. Other air pollutants, such as ozone, have also been associated with exacerbations of COPD in epidemiological studies.
Natural history
Studies in the 1960s, particularly in the UK, suggested that exacerbations of COPD were associated with small and transient decreases in respiratory function, and therefore did not alter the natural history of the disease. However, this view has since been challenged, and it is believed there may be a small but significant accelerated decline in lung function as a result of exacerbations of COPD. There are several large population studies showing that the number of exacerbations experienced increases with the severity of the underlying disease. The median number of exacerbations in patients with severe COPD is around 2.2-2.5 exacerbations per year. Frequent exacerbations (more than two per year) are associated with a poor quality of life, increased decline in pulmonary function and increased mortality. The frequency of exacerbations can be accurately assessed by patient recall.
Follow-up of patients with exacerbations of COPD shows a high readmission rate of around 30% over the first 3 months. Patients with recurrent exacerbations (three or more exacerbations per year) have a higher mortality rate and a decreased quality of life.
Symptoms and signs
Patients with acute exacerbations typically present with increased cough, changes in sputum volume and/or purulence, and increased breathlessness, wheezing and chest tightness. The clinical history, examination and arterial blood gases are used to assess the severity of the exacerbation in order to judge whether a patient requires admission to hospital. A number of other non-specific symptoms, such as malaise, sleepiness, fatigue and confusion, may occur in exacerbations. Fever may be present and an increase in sputum purulence suggests a bacterial cause, as does a history of chronic sputum production. The severity of the exacerbation is assessed from the medical history, particularly the severity of the underlying COPD, the presence of pre-existing comorbidities, the physical examination and gas measurements (Table 8.4).
Respiratory failure may or may not be present, as may cyanosis and the flapping tremor of hypercapnia, but these signs are rather insensitive. Pulse oximetry can rapidly provide information about oxygen saturation, but arterial blood gases should be measured in all patients with severe exacerbations. Peak expiratory flow measurements are not as useful for determining the need for hospital admission in COPD as they are in asthma. Chest radiographs may be useful to diagnose conditions that may mimic symptoms of an exacerbation (see below and page 133).
The presence of purulent sputum during an exacerbation is usually a sufficient indication for starting empirical antibiotic treatment. If an exacerbation does not respond to such treatment, sputum should be cultured and bacterial sensitivities identified.
Several conditions may mimic COPD exacerbations including congestive cardiac failure, pneumothorax, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism and cardiac arrhythmia. It is particularly important to consider these differential diagnoses in patients with exacerbations of COPD who do not respond to treatment.
Prevention or reduction in the severity or length of exacerbations of COPD is a major goal of management. Influenza vaccination is recommended since it reduces hospitalization for pneumonia in elderly patients with COPD during epidemics. Vaccination against streptococcal pneumonia is available and is effective in preventing the complications of the infection.
There is now evidence that a range of drugs including long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting anticholinergic agents can reduce the frequency of exacerbations. The combination of a LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid is more effective in reducing exacerbations than either agent individually.
The use of mucolytic agents in COPD has been evaluated in a number of studies. The effects on the frequency of exacerbations have been mixed. There is, however, some evidence that, in patients with COPD who have not been treated with an inhaled corticosteroid, mucolytics may reduce exacerbations.
The aims of management in exacerbations of COPD are to relieve airway obstruction, correct hypoxemia, address any comorbid disorder that may contribute to respiratory deterioration and treat any precipitating causes such as infection.
Management at home. Most exacerbations of COPD are treated in primary care; only a minority of patients are admitted to hospital.
Bronchodilators. The dose and the frequency of use of bronchodilators are increased in home management of exacerbations of COPD. If not already used, therapy with multiple bronchodilator classes may be added if symptoms are not improving. In the most severe cases, high-dose nebulized bronchodilators can be given on a regular or as-required basis for several days. However, there is evidence that the use of multiple doses of bronchodilators by metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device has an effect similar to that of nebulized bronchodilators in exacerbations of COPD. When a nebulizer is used, it is probably safer to use air as the driving gas, rather than oxygen, and to continue oxygen therapy via nasal prongs. The long-term use of nebulized therapy after acute exacerbations of COPD is not routinely recommended.
Antibiotics. The use of antibiotics in exacerbations of COPD is still controversial. In mild-to-moderate exacerbations, sputum culture is not usually necessary. Patients with purulent sputum and at least one of increased breathlessness or increased sputum production show greater improvement with antibiotics than with placebo during exacerbations of COPD. Simple antibiotics, modified according to local bacterial resistance patterns, should be used. Amoxicillin can be given in most cases as first-line treatment, or co-amoxiclav in those who fail to respond or who are known or suspected to have beta-lactamase-producing organisms in their sputum. Clarithromycin or doxycycline is an alternative in patients who are hypersensitive to penicillins.
Glucocorticosteroids. The use of corticosteroids in exacerbations of COPD is now well established. Several controlled trials have shown that systemic corticosteroids achieve a greater improvement in spirometry, shorten recovery time, reduce length of stay in hospital, reduce the risk of early relapse and have fewer treatment failures than placebo. The exact dose of corticosteroids that should be given has not yet been established, but present evidence suggests that 40 mg/day for 5 days is appropriate.
Hospital treatment. Provisional guidelines provide indications for hospital admission for acute exacerbations of COPD (Table 8.5).
Blood gases should be measured in all severe exacerbations of COPD. A partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO) below 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg), a partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO) above 9.3 kPa (70 mmHg) or a pH below 7.3 suggests a life-threatening episode that needs close monitoring or management in an intensive care unit (ICU).
The presence of a pulmonary embolism, which can mimic an exacerbation of COPD, can be very difficult to diagnose, particularly in patients with COPD. Chest radiographs are useful in diagnosis. A low diastolic blood pressure and an inability to increase the PaO to more than 8 kPa (60 mmHg) despite oxygen therapy also suggest pulmonary embolism. Spiral computed tomography pulmonary angiography is the best tool available for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Ventilation/perfusion scanning is of no value in patients with COPD.
The first actions when treating patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of COPD are to provide controlled oxygen therapy and to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening, in which case admission to an ICU is indicated. Management of other acute exacerbations of COPD is summarized in Table 8.6.
Oxygen therapy aims to maintain adequate oxygenation (PaO > 8 kPa [60 mmHg] or percentage oxygen saturation of arterial blood [SaO ] of 88-92%) without worsening the hypercapnia. Many patients who have chronic hypoxemia will tolerate a lower PaO (> 6.7 kPa [50 mmHg]) after administration of oxygen. Oxygen is given in inspired concentrations of 24-28% by Venturi mask or 1-2 liters/minute by nasal prongs. Arterial blood gases should be remeasured after 30-60 minutes to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without additional retention of carbon dioxide and consequent acidosis. Oxygen masks provide a more accurate inspired oxygen concentration, but nasal prongs are better tolerated.
Bronchodilator therapy can mitigate the effects of increased airway obstruction, namely increased respiratory work of breathing (hyperinflation, respiratory muscle mechanical disadvantage and impaired ventilation/perfusion matching), causing hypoxemia in patients with exacerbations of COPD. Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) are preferred as initial bronchodilators in acute exacerbations. Although they are usually given in nebulized form, there is evidence that administration of beta-agonists via metered-dose inhaler and spacer device is equally efficacious.
Nebulizers should be powered by compressed air rather than oxygen if the PaCO is raised, to prevent worsening hypercapnia and acidosis. Oxygen administration via nasal prongs can continue at 1-2 liters/minute during nebulization.
If the response to a beta-agonist is not prompt, or if the patient has a very severe exacerbation, the anticholinergic drug ipratropium bromide can be added.
The role of intravenous aminophylline in the treatment of COPD exacerbations is controversial. Studies have shown minor improvements in lung volumes following administration of aminophylline, but also worsening gas exchange. Monitoring of serum theophylline levels is recommended to avoid the side effects of these drugs.
Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve lung function effectively in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Currently, systemic corticosteroid, 40 mg/day for 5 days, is recommended for all patients with an acute exacerbation in the absence of significant contraindications. Oral corticosteroids are preferable. Nebulized budesonide is an alternative to oral corticosteroid treatment in exacerbations without respiratory failure and is associated with a reduction in complications, such as hyperglycemia. Corticosteroids should be discontinued after the acute episode; clinical improvement with corticosteroids during the exacerbation does not indicate the need for long-term treatment with oral or inhaled corticosteroids.
Antibiotic therapy in exacerbations of COPD was the subject of a meta-analysis of nine randomized placebo-controlled trials. This analysis established a small but significant benefit, which was most evident in patients with the most symptoms. When two of the three cardinal symptoms (increasing breathlessness, increasing sputum volume and increasing sputum purulence) were present, with one of these being increased sputum purulence, there was a significant improvement following treatment with antibiotics compared with placebo.
In most cases, sputum Gram-stain or culture is unnecessary. Oral rather than intravenous antibiotics should be given. Failure to respond to simple antibiotics (as described above), the known presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in sputum or severe exacerbations are all indications for a broader spectrum antibiotic, such as co-amoxiclav, a second- or third-generation cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone, or a newer macrolide.
Sputum clearance. Airway inflammation in exacerbations of COPD promotes mucus hypersecretion. There are no convincing data to support the use of pharmacological agents to improve mucokinetics during exacerbations. The use of mechanical techniques such as physiotherapy have no proven value in acute exacerbations, unless a large amount of sputum (> 25 mL) is produced daily or there is mucus plugging with lobar atelectasis. Physiotherapy is not recommended in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.
Diuretics are indicated in the presence of edema and raised jugular venous pressure.
Anticoagulants, specifically prophylactic subcutaneous heparin, should be administered to patients with severe exacerbations, particularly those who are immobile and those with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.
Ventilatory support
The objectives of mechanical ventilatory support in patients with exacerbations of COPD are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and relieve symptoms. Ventilatory support includes both non-invasive ventilation using negative or positive pressure devices and invasive mechanical ventilation by endotracheal intubation.
Non-invasive intermittent ventilation has been shown in several randomized control trials in acute respiratory failure in COPD to reduce respiratory acidosis, the severity of breathlessness, the length of stay in hospital, the need for intubation and mortality. However, non-invasive ventilation is not appropriate for all patients (Table 8.7).
Invasive mechanical ventilation. The indications for initiating invasive mechanical ventilation during exacerbations of COPD are shown in Table 8.8. Use of invasive ventilation in patients with end-stage COPD is influenced by the patient's wishes and the likelihood of reversing the precipitating events. A clear statement of the patient's own treatment wishes - an advance directive - may make these decisions easier.
Hospital discharge and follow-up
There are no data indicating the optimal duration of hospitalization for acute exacerbations of COPD, but suggested discharge criteria are listed in Table 8.9. Follow-up assessment 4-6 weeks after discharge from hospital is recommended (Table 8.10). To ensure that any abnormalities seen on chest radiograph have completely resolved, another radiograph should be taken at 6 weeks' follow up. Recommendations for re-imaging nodules incidentally detected on CT scan should be based on smoking history.
The presence of hypoxemia during an exacerbation of COPD should prompt rechecking of blood gases at discharge. If the patient remains hypoxemic, the need for long-term outpatient oxygen therapy should be assessed when the patient attains a stable state.
Randomized controlled trials have shown that 20-30% of patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of COPD can be safely allowed home with support without adverse consequences.","<BULL> Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and place a huge burden on healthcare resources. <BULL> The main etiologic factors in acute exacerbations are bacterial infection, respiratory viruses and air pollution. <BULL> Treatment includes oxygen, increased use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and short-term oral glucocorticosteroids. <BULL> Exacerbations can be prevented by inhaled corticosteroids and vaccination against influenza. <BULL> Most exacerbations of COPD are managed at home, but those with suspected respiratory failure should be admitted to hospital. <BULL> Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.","As), inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting anticholinergic agents can reduce the frequency of exacerbations of COPD are shown in Table 8.8.

9781910797105,ch06,"Neuroanatomy and structural imaging
Our knowledge of the neuroanatomy of schizophrenia is derived from four major sources:
structural imaging
neuropsychology and functional imaging
postmortem neurochemical and structural investigations.
Of the above, structural imaging has been most extensively used to examine the brains of people with schizophrenia.
Early imaging studies
Pneumoencephalography. The first structural imaging studies were performed using pneumoencephalography (PEG), a technique based on the X-ray contrast of air injected into the lumbar subarachnoid space, bone and brain tissue. PEG studies documented a number of abnormalities in people with schizophrenia, including ventricular system enlargement. However, the invasive nature of the procedure limited its application and eventually led to the abandonment of its use.
Computed tomography (CT), an in vivo X-ray-based imaging technique for visualizing the brain, enabled investigators to confirm the observation of ventricular enlargement. This finding has been reproduced many times and represents one of the most commonly observed biological findings in schizophrenia. The other major abnormality revealed by CT scanning is a widening of the cortical sulci, which separate the different cerebral gyri.
These observations greatly influenced our understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. They provided strong evidence that a substantial proportion of people with schizophrenia have structural abnormalities of the brain. In addition, they reawakened interest in schizophrenia as a brain disease and counteracted the prevailing view at that time of schizophrenia being caused by psychosocial factors.
There are, however, two major limitations to CT scanning. First, CT scans do not permit sufficient resolution of cortical and subcortical gray matter (id est nerve cells) and white matter (id est fiber tracts connecting different nerve cells). The lack of resolution precludes the morphological assessment of specific cortical and subcortical structures. Second, although ventricular enlargement and cortical sulcal widening suggest that people with schizophrenia may have relatively less brain tissue than normal controls, they are non-specific measures and cannot tell us where in the brain the tissue loss occurs, or whether the decrease in tissue is due to a developmental failure or to neurodegenerative processes.
There are a number of structures anatomically related to the ventricular system, including basal ganglia nuclei, limbic system structures (id est the amygdala and hippocampus), thalamus and cortical white matter. Ventricular enlargement could be due to morphological abnormalities in any one or combination of these structures. Similarly, sulcal widening could be due to changes in cortical gray and/or white matter. Only the direct measurement of these two cortical tissue types would allow the cause of sulcal widening to be determined.
Magnetic resonance imaging
The advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enabled investigators to overcome the limitations of CT scanning. MRI produces high-quality images, based on the use of magnetic energy and the water content of different tissue types. MRI scans can be segmented into the three different tissue types or compartments:
gray matter, both cortical and subcortical
white matter
cerebrospinal fluid.
As these three compartments can each be measured, MRI enabled investigators to examine whether the brains of people with schizophrenia were characterized by specific morphological abnormalities. MRI scans can also be obtained in a three-dimensional (3D) format from which 3D representations of the brain can be constructed, thus facilitating the morphological assessment of specific cortical gyri. MRI can also be used to examine cortical thickness and cortical surface area, an indirect measure of the extent of cortical gyrification. These latter measures are thought to have differential developmental/genetic determinants.
Morphological findings. MRI studies confirmed the previous findings of enlarged ventricles, with patients exhibiting about a one-third increase in ventricular volume compared with controls (Figure 6.1), and increased sulcal widening (Figure 6.2). MRI studies demonstrated for the first time the involvement of cortical and subcortical gray matter structures. Specifically, people with schizophrenia were shown to exhibit decreased volume of the neocortex, by about 5%, with specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. These brain regions are the neuroanatomic substrate for the complex cognitive behaviors that are disrupted in schizophrenia. In addition to volume reductions in these areas, several studies have found that people with schizophrenia have a reversal or loss of the normal asymmetry of these structures.
MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of limbic system structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampus (Figure 6.3). These structures are involved in the regulation of emotions and various forms of memory. The magnitude of these changes is relatively small (Table 6.1), but the observations have been shown to be highly reliable, especially for the hippocampus. MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of specific thalamic nuclei and total volume of the thalamus. Thalamic nuclei play a central role in gating the flow of information to the cerebral cortex and in regulating the activation of specific cortical brain areas in response to external or internal stimuli or signals. These MRI results are consistent with postmortem study reports documenting decreased volume of the medial dorsal and pulvinar thalamic nuclei.
Finally, a series of studies has shown that the brains of people with schizophrenia are characterized by widespread abnormal thinning of the cerebral cortex, with marked changes in the frontal, temporal and cingulated cortical regions. The reductions in cortical thickness have been related to cognition, course of illness, symptoms and specific genetic polymorphisms.
Other MRI findings. In addition to locating the areas of the brain affected by schizophrenia, MRI studies have also been useful for examining:
pathophysiological models of schizophrenia
neuroanatomy of cognitive abnormalities and symptoms
morphological consequences of exposure to environmental risk factors
etiologic theories of schizophrenia.
Progression of brain changes. A series of longitudinal studies involving multiple MRI has evaluated whether schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with fixed morphological abnormalities, or a neurodegenerative disorder, with progressive changes in brain structure. These studies, conducted in childhood-onset, first-episode and chronic patient populations, have consistently demonstrated 2-10% decreases in cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes and 5-10% increases in ventricular volume. The extent to which these results apply to a subgroup or to the total schizophrenia population is unknown. The possible progression of brain changes would be consistent with increased functional disability and cognitive decrements observed in a proportion of people with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown consistently that superior and medial frontal structural changes occur in young people at clinical high risk if they make the transition to full psychosis compared with those who do not.
Morphological changes associated with specific symptoms. Several studies have observed an association between decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) gray matter and hallucinations and delusions or positive formal thought disorder. Hallucinations and delusions are more frequently associated with decreased volume of the anterior STG, and positive formal thought disorder with decreased volume of the posterior STG. MRI has also been used to show that people with schizophrenia have a loss of the normal asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres, especially of the planum temporale, a region of the brain involved in audition and language. These observations have led to the development of etiologic hypotheses concerning abnormalities in the normal process of brain lateralization.
Effect of antipsychotic agents on brain structure. There is relatively consistent MRI evidence that first-generation antipsychotic treatment may lead to increased basal ganglia volume, which is reversed with clozapine and, possibly, with treatment with other second-generation antipsychotics. Emerging data also suggest that greater antipsychotic exposure may be related to increased loss of gray and white matter. These findings are consistent with the effects of long-term antipsychotic exposure in rodents and non-human primates.
Diffusion tensor imaging
The observation of multiple morphological abnormalities in cortical and subcortical gray matter raises the question of whether there is a disturbance in the white matter fiber tracts that connect these regions. There have been reports of decreased white matter volume, but such changes have not been observed consistently. Moreover, traditional MRI structural scans are not able to differentiate specific fiber tracts.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on the diffusion of water through different brain tissues and allows for the evaluation of white matter integrity. In addition, DTI may be used to identify and measure specific white matter fiber tracts (Figure 6.4). DTI studies have documented widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy (a measure of white matter integrity) in the white matter of people with schizophrenia, but the localization of the abnormalities has differed across studies. In addition, multiple fiber tracts have been shown to be characterized by reduced fractional anisotropy. Several studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia with persistent negative symptoms have decreased fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts associated with social cognition.
In combination with functional imaging, genetic and postmortem studies, DTI studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a dysconnection syndrome, characterized by abnormal connectivity among the different cortical and subcortical brain regions.
Summary of brain pathology
The reduced cerebral cortical volume and thickness observed with MRI appears to result from a loss of the supportive glial cells, such as astrocytes, leading to an increased packing of neurons (Table 6.2). Glial cells, particularly astrocytes, promote synaptic function. The reduced synaptic and dendritic complexity that has been observed might result from early developmental abnormalities, abnormal fiber tract connections, an increase in the synaptic pruning that normally occurs in adolescence or a later progressive process.","<BULL> People with schizophrenia exhibit gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. <BULL> People with schizophrenia have decreased volume of subcortical structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus and thalamus. <BULL> A subgroup of patients may exhibit progressive changes in brain structure over the course of their illness. <BULL> Men with schizophrenia have been found to have greater volume reductions in the temporal lobes than women. <BULL> Hallucinations, delusions and positive formal thought disorder are associated with decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus. <BULL> Diffusion tensor imaging studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormal connections among cortical and subcortical structures.","Neuroanatomy and structural imaging.

9783318068207,hh-5,"The recent improvements in terms of available technologies and bioinformatics tools have allowed a better understanding of the pathobiology of different tumor types and the identification of several genomic alterations that may be targetable. CGP offers a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor for both prognostic and predictive purposes, helping oncologists make decisions about cancer treatment.
The adoption of broad NGS gene panels (Table 3.1) may support the administration of immunotherapy drugs in patients harboring high TMB (see page 45). Another potentially valuable approach is hybrid capture-based CGP, an ultra-sensitive assay that can be used to detect variants even in specimens with low tumor purity (a low proportion of tumor cells). The implementation of CGP in clinical practice is, however, limited by issues such as costs, turnaround time, sensitivity, specificity and bioinformatics pipelines. Despite increasing knowledge of the cancer molecular landscape, the clinical and pathological significance of several molecular variants, including SNVs, CNVs and indels, remains unknown and unexplored.
As far as variants are concerned and, in particular, when rare or unknown mutations are reported, it is fundamentally important to define the association with the risk of cancer development and progression. In this setting, it is pivotal to predict the structure and the potential functional impact of the proteins generated to:
define the frequency of appearance in the healthy population
identify the inheritance within a family when the same pathological condition is evidenced
assess the statistical significance of the association with cancer when the same alteration is identified in independent cancer patients.
Single nucleotide variants in coding and intronic regions can significantly alter the functions of cancer-related genes. An interesting field of investigation regarding SNVs involves mutations that affect non-coding regions. Mutations in these sequences in 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) are frequently implicated in cancer-related oncogenes.
Copy number variants represent an important mechanism of activation and inactivation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, respectively. However, the detection of CNVs is limited by exon-capturing methods that do not cover many recurrent CNV regions and by other computational biases. To overcome these biases, it is possible to define a CNV by the ratio of copies in cancer and normal DNA.
Indels present several issues: in particular, they are not always easy to compare using different variant callers (separating real variants from artifacts), because there are several correct ways of reporting them; this factor may significantly limit reproducibility among laboratories.
Microsatellite instability
Microsatellites are repetitive, highly preserved DNA sequences that occur throughout the genome. Their nature makes them particularly prone to DNA-mismatching errors (MSI) that can occur during DNA replication.
Four genes are involved in the process of mismatch repair (MMR), which is the cell's method of overcoming these errors: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. These genes encode four proteins, mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) and post-meiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2), that form heterodimers: MLH1-PMS2 and MSH2-MSH6. These heterodimers work with other proteins to nick the strand around the mutation and repair the sequence. The inactivation of this system leads to a deficient MMR (dMMR) mechanism (Figure 3.1).
Interestingly, only MLH1 and MSH2 are necessary partners in the heterodimers: MSH6 and PMS2 can be replaced by other proteins (such as MSH3, MLH3 and PMS1). To determine the MMR status, both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR-based techniques can be adopted.
Immunohistochemistry uses tagged antibodies to detect specific proteins - MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 in this instance - in tissue slices or samples. The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends IHC as the first-line test to assess MMR status in sporadic cancer belonging to the spectrum of Lynch syndrome (colorectal, endometrial, small intestine, urothelial, central nervous system and sebaceous gland; Table 3.2).
As discussed above, MLH1 mutations are related to loss on IHC of both MLH1 and PMS2; in the same way, mutations in MSH2 relate to the loss of both MSH2 and MSH6 on IHC. Overall, it is necessary to adopt all four IHC antibodies to define MMR status. However, IHC can be affected by several issues - for example, false-negative results may relate to problems with tissue fixation. Where there are fixation issues, it is important to focus on positive internal controls (for example, immune cells).
PCR-based techniques involve comparing the profiles of microsatellite loci generated by amplification from neoplastic samples and corresponding normal tissue material obtained from the same patient. If a locus reports a discordance between neoplastic and normal tissue samples, MSI is reported. Two different reference panels are used: one that considers two mononucleotide (BAT-25 and BAT-26) and three dinucleotide (D5S346, D2S123 and D17S250) repeats (an example is shown in Figure 3.2), and the other adopting five polyA mononucleotide repeats (BAT-25, BAT-26, NR-21, NR-24, NR-27)., This latter panel is associated with a higher sensitivity and specificity. MSI status is defined when two or more of five microsatellite loci are unstable.
In indeterminate IHC cases, PCR may be a reliable and highly specific and sensitive tool to define MSI status. ESMO guidance suggests that MSI-low (only one unstable locus) should be considered microsatellite stable (MSS).
NGS may represent a valid alternative for MMR status assessment.
MSI as a predictive biomarker. Because of the development of several mutations, MSI-high (MSI-H) status is a predictive biomarker of response to immunotherapy., In May 2017, the FDA approved the use of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in advanced stage solid tumors with MSI-H (evaluated by PCR or NGS) or dMMR (evaluated by IHC) status. Other immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, are now also being used to treat some MSI-H cancers.
Tumor mutational burden
TMB is the number of somatic, non-synonymous, coding base mutations that occur in a defined region of a tumor genome. The accumulation of a high number of mutations is able to generate several neoantigens that can potentially elicit a severe immune response against the tumor. In this setting, CGP may usefully detect advanced stage cancers with high TMB. Rizvi et al. have highlighted the responsiveness of patients with advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high TMB to the anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody pembrolizumab. They emphasized that durable clinical benefit and progression-free survival (PFS) were higher in the cohort of patients with more than 200 mutations compared with patients with low TMB (< 200 mutations).
Snyder et al. found similar results using a WES approach in patients with melanoma. The responsiveness and overall survival of patients treated with the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab was higher in the high TMB cohort. However, as WES is currently unfeasible in routine clinical practice, with its high costs and long turnaround time, several different approaches are now employed, based on wide NGS panels.
In the CheckMate 227 and 568 clinical trials, TMB was evaluated using the FoundationOne CDx assay to support the administration of an immunotherapy combination (ipilimumab plus nivolumab) in advanced stage NSCLC. Patients were defined as having a high TMB when the tumor DNA harbored at least ten mutations per megabase.
Different gene panels are available to evaluate TMB status (see Table 3.1). For example, Rizvi et al. adopted three different versions of the MSK-IMPACT panel, covering 341, 410 and 468 genes, to assess TMB.
Data interpretation potentially limits the usefulness of TMB analysis, regardless of the approach adopted (WES versus wide gene panels) and gene panel employed. In terms of prediction of suitability for immunotherapeutic regimens, it is important to analyze not only the total number but also the type of the detected mutations. While Rizvi et al. underlined the positive predictive value for immunotherapy when mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and replication are identified, Skoulidis et al. demonstrated that mutations in STK11 (also known as LKB1) were associated with resistance to immunotherapeutic drugs.
Fusions and splice variants. RNA-based molecular approaches, such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), NGS and multiplex digital color-coded barcode technology, play a key role in identifying targetable gene fusions (Figure 3.3). These are chimeric genes generated from the fusion of two different genes belonging to the same or different chromosomes.
According to international guidelines, a person with advanced stage NSCLC is potentially eligible for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy if they have a gene fusion involving ALK or ROS1. Other gene fusions have also been identified and are now the basis of therapeutic indications and/or are being explored in clinical trials (see Chapter 5).
As well as a predictive role, the identification of gene fusions may also have a key diagnostic function for assessing risk of malignancy, such as in thyroid nodules with undetermined cytological diagnosis. In particular, PAX8 / PPARG and RET / CCDC6 gene fusions are more frequently associated with thyroid malignancies.
Another important field of application for RNA-based molecular approaches is the identification of splice variants. The variation occurs at the splice site between an exon and an intron. It leads to alternative RNA splicing, resulting from the loss of exons or the inclusion of introns, and the generation of a novel protein (Figure 3.4).
As for gene fusions, the presence of a splice variant may have a predictive role for therapy. In advanced stage NSCLC, MET exon 14 skipping is associated with responsiveness to crizotinib and cabozantinib.
However, several issues affect RNA analysis. In particular, RNA is less stable than DNA, and for this reason careful attention must be paid to pre-analytic factors that could interfere with RNA stability. In particular, fixation procedures may significantly influence RNA integrity and stability. An alcohol-based fixative gives better results in terms of RNA quality and quantity than a formalin-based fixative.
When RT-PCR is used, careful attention should be paid to the design of primers. In particular, to minimize the risk of false-positive results or overestimation of gene expression, primers should be designed to lie on exon/exon junctions. As far as the complementary DNA (cDNA) input is concerned, the concentration should be between 10 pg and 1 μg.
An important limitation is that the RT-PCR method can only identify known alterations. This limitation can be overcome by NGS, which allows the identification of known and unknown gene alterations for different patients simultaneously. However, NGS suffers from several limitations related to high costs and, in particular, data interpretation (see Chapter 6). Strengthening automated data analysis with ad hoc information from the bioinformatics pipeline may reduce this issue.
The nCounter Analysis System is another approach. This is a multiplex digital color-coded barcode technology that can identify gene fusions and splice variants simultaneously. Only a small amount of RNA input is needed (25-250 ng) and the method has a short turnaround time for testing (about 3 working days). In addition, the nCounter technology is able to identify several gene fusions and splice variants, even when RNA is of low quality and target capture amplification fails.
The nCounter workflow is characterized by four main steps:
pairs of probes (reporter probe and capture probe), designed to be adjacent to one another along the target sequence of a transcript, are hybridized with mRNAs
excess probes are removed and the hybridized complex is bound to the surface of the sample cartridge
the probe/target complexes are aligned on the cartridge by an electric current and immobilized for data collection
the sample cartridge is scanned by a digital analyzer, and each color code is counted and tabulated.
The nCounter system has a number of limitations, however. In particular, results generated by reading the color-coded barcodes are not directly usable for clinical purposes. Thus, additional data processing is required. Furthermore, careful attention needs to be paid to the design of the probe to avoid false-positive results.","<BULL> Comprehensive genomic profiles offer a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor.

9781910797105,ch04,"The biggest single clue we have about the cause of schizophrenia is that it often runs in families. Although this observation was first made in the opening years of the 20th century, until relatively recently it was disputed whether or not this family clustering was truly a genetic effect. Like most disorders, schizophrenia results from an interaction of genes and environment, with likely gene-gene interactions (known as epistasis).
Classic studies
The most straightforward studies in population genetics are family studies. Usually, a series of individuals with schizophrenia, known as probands or index cases, is selected and rates of schizophrenia are assessed in their biological families. These rates are compared with rates in the families of control probands, usually healthy volunteers. To express the results as rates, the number of affected relatives is divided by the total number and is age-corrected for relatives who are too young to have the disorder or are not yet through the age range at highest risk.
The risk of schizophrenia in relatives depends first on how close the relative is to the proband (Figure 4.1). Spouses are at slightly increased risk because of assortative mating (id est selection of similar partners). Relatives of female probands have higher rates of schizophrenia than relatives of male probands.
Family studies can never give conclusive proof of genetic effects, as familiality could be due to a shared environmental factor. Nevertheless, family studies have shown that if there is a genetic effect, it does not follow a recognized Mendelian pattern of autosomal dominance, like Huntington's disease, or recessiveness, like cystic fibrosis.
Studies in twins and adopted children
Studies in twins involve probands with schizophrenia who are either identical (monozygotic: MZ) or non-identical (dizygotic: DZ). MZ twins share 100% of their genes and DZ twins share about 50%. Concordance rates in the two types of twins are compared by looking at the rate at which co-twins also have schizophrenia. The consensus from population-based studies is that concordance rates are about 45% for MZ co-twins and 15% for DZ co-twins. The fact that concordance is less than 100% in MZ twins suggests that non-genetic, environmental factors are also involved. However, the offspring of the unaffected MZ co-twins in discordant pairs are at increased risk of schizophrenia, suggesting that the co-twins still carry a genetic predisposition for the disease.
Adoption studies offer the most robust evidence for genetic effects, as family environment is taken out of the equation. Both follow-up and follow-back studies (see below) have shown that it is biological parentage rather than adoptive parentage that predisposes to schizophrenia.
Follow-up studies trace the biological children of mothers with schizophrenia, who were adopted into healthy families at birth, and compare the number of offspring who develop schizophrenia with control adoptees of healthy non-schizophrenic mothers.
Follow-back studies start with a group of adults with schizophrenia who were known to be adopted at birth. The biological parents are traced and their rates of illness compared with those in the biological parents of control adoptees.
The extended phenotype
The results from family, twin and adoption studies subjected to modern diagnostic criteria support the notion that a proportion of biological relatives of probands with schizophrenia, while not having frank schizophrenia, have an unusual cluster of traits, such as schizotypal personality disorder or schizotypy. A number of other schizophrenia spectrum disorders are found in the families of probands with schizophrenia (Table 4.1).
Measurement of cognitive abnormalities provides an alternative approach for defining the phenotype. Impairments in attention, evoked potentials such as the P50 wave, working memory, and smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements are often seen in patients and their families. These cognitive abnormalities may be more sensitive than diagnostic categories for indicating the presence of genes for schizophrenia. They can supplement the use of diagnostic categories in genetic studies, enhancing the likelihood of detecting these genes.
How to look for genes
Clinically, schizophrenia varies widely in its symptoms and course. This has often been taken as evidence for etiologic heterogeneity, either with several different mutations yielding slightly different clinical pictures, or with familial and non-familial forms. However, there are several mechanisms that may alter the extent to which a gene is expressed. Partial penetrance or variable expressivity can produce a range of effects from the same gene; for example, in neurofibromatosis the gene that produces an 'elephant man' effect in one person produces only a few skin speckles in another. Interaction between genes (epistasis) also occurs.
People differ genetically in three main ways.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common variations in just one nucleotide. There are over 2 million known SNPs and while most are silent, a few have subtle effects.
Genetic mutations are rare and can be harmful.
Copy number variants (CNVs) are a more recent discovery and involve duplications or deletions of sections of DNA. They can be harmful or silent.
The search for genes in schizophrenia is difficult for several reasons (Table 4.2). Until recently, the search for risk genes was directed by genetic linkage studies that revealed the location of particular risk loci on the chromosome, candidate gene studies, or the discovery of chromosomal abnormalities that increased risk. For example, the rare velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is caused by a deletion on chromosome 22; 25% of people with VCFS develop schizophrenia.
Nowadays, the whole genome can be studied simultaneously in genome-wide association studies in which over 500000 SNPs spread across the genome are tested for association with schizophrenia.
Risk genes for schizophrenia
It is emerging that there are multiple susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. These divide into common genetic variants (SNPs), each of which confers a small (less than twofold) increased risk, and rare variants such as CNVs that can confer increased risk of 20-fold or more.
Of the common variants, the evidence is strongest for the genes for zinc finger protein (ZNF804A; chromosome 2q32), neuregulin (NRG1; 8p12), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 6p22) and DISC1 (1q42) (Table 4.3). The DISC1 linkage followed from the finding of a Scottish pedigree with a balanced 1;11 chromosomal translocation that co-segregated with schizophrenia. The catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene is central to dopamine metabolism and has been studied because it is located close to the VCFS region at 22q11. A missense mutation in the COMT gene gives a valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 158, which produces an unstable enzyme, with reduced breakdown of dopamine. Individuals with this polymorphism have altered activity of the prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks, and in schizophrenia it has been shown to predict the degree of improvement in working memory and negative symptoms in schizophrenia treated with olanzapine.
To date, the definitive genome-wide association studies in 37 000 adults with schizophrenia and 113 000 controls have shown 108 different genetic associations, including dopamine and glutamate receptor genes and calcium channel genes.
Most of the genes found by genome-wide association studies to be implicated in schizophrenia do seem plausible in that they are known to exert effects on neuronal systems and particularly synaptic function. It appears too that different genes give different symptom profiles; for example, ZNF804A is associated with better cognition, NRG1 with preserved affect and the dysbindin gene (DTNBP1) with IQ. Examples are being uncovered of synergistic gene-gene interactions, and of how specific genes interact with specific environmental risk factors (Table 4.4). Studies looking at patterns of gene expression in the postmortem brain suggest changes in particular functional gene groups in schizophrenia, such as those related to oligodendrocyte and myelin development and synaptic transmission.
Copy number variants
It is only since 2008 that the significance of CNVs for neuropsychiatry has been realized. They are usually, but not always, sporadic (arising de novo) duplications or deletions of stretches of DNA several thousand to a million base pairs long. They exist in everyone, at all locations in the genome, and may or may not be passed on. Rates of CNVs have been shown to be higher in schizophrenia as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (Table 4.5). It is thought that approximately 2% of people with schizophrenia have CNVs. Some CNVs for schizophrenia are associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders; for example, duplications at 15q13.3 are also the region for the commonest duplications in autism and Prader-Willi syndrome.
It is known that older paternal age is a risk factor for schizophrenia, and this is probably mediated by the increase in de novo mutations in the germ cell line in older fathers. Clinical genetic testing using genome-wide microarrays should now be recommended for people with schizophrenia plus a learning disability or congenital anomaly.
The overlap with bipolar disorder
As genes predisposing to schizophrenia are now being discovered, there is renewed interest in the association between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It has long been known that neither disorder 'breeds true'. The children of mothers with schizophrenia have a sixfold increased risk of bipolar disorder, as well as higher rates of schizophrenia. Estimates suggest that perhaps 60% of the genetic variance for the two disorders is shared. Some genes, such as DISC1 and NRG1, appear to predispose to both disorders and perhaps have their strongest effect in schizoaffective disorders.
However, the neurodevelopmental risk factors that particularly appear to characterize schizophrenia, such as delayed milestones and obstetric complications, are not found in individuals who later develop bipolar disorder. Raised rates of CNVs are seen in schizophrenia, but not bipolar disorder.","<BULL> Having a close relative with schizophrenia increases one's own risk 15-fold. <BULL> Identical twins show a 45% concordance rate. <BULL> Individual vulnerability genes exist, which are each of small effect and interact with other genes and with environmental factors. <BULL> A growing number of susceptibility genes have been identified, some of which also predispose to bipolar disorder. <BULL> Copy number variants are rare major genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.","The biggest single clue we have about the cause of schizophrenia is that it often runs in families.

The risk of schizophrenia in male probands is higher than that of female probands.Of the common variants, the evidence is strongest for the genes for zinc finger protein (ZNF804A; chromosome 2q32), neuregulin (NRG1; 8p12), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 6p22) and DISC1 (1q42) (Table 4.3). The DISC1 linkage followed from the finding of a Scottish pedigree with a balanced 1;11 chromosomal translocation that co-segregated with schizophrenia. The catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene is central to dopamine metabolism and has been studied because it is located close to the VCFS region at 22q11. Studies looking at patterns of gene expression in the postmortem brain suggest that there may be a genetic effect on schizophrenia. There is no evidence that there is a genetic effect in schizophrenia.There is no evidence"

The characteristic symptom of COPD is breathlessness on exertion, sometimes accompanied by wheeze and cough, which is often, but not invariably, productive. Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly` causes the patient to seek medical attention, and it is usually the most disabling. Patients often date the onset of their illness from an episode of worsening cough with sputum production, which leaves them with a degree of chronic breathlessness. However, close questioning will often reveal the presence of a 'smoker's cough' over a period of years, along with the production of small amounts (usually < 60 mL/day) of mucoid sputum, usually predominantly in the morning.
Most patients (80%) with COPD will have a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years (1 pack-year is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes [1 pack] per day for 1 year or 10 a day for 2 years) before symptoms are recognized, commonly in the fifth decade. However, COPD may occur in the non-smoker and is more frequently missed in this setting.
It is characteristic of patients with COPD to progress through the clinical stages of mild, moderate and severe disease. Symptoms and signs therefore vary in any individual depending on the stage of the disease. Considerable loss of lung function can occur before symptoms become apparent, and many patients may seek medical attention when the disease is at an advanced stage, since COPD is a slowly progressive disorder and patients gradually adapt their lives to their disability. Most smokers accept cough and shortness of breath, so they often dismiss these symptoms of progressive airflow limitation as a normal consequence of their smoking habit and the aging process.
Breathlessness is the symptom that causes most disability and is associated with loss of lung function over time. In good health, the body meets the increased oxygen demand produced by exercise by using some of the inspiratory reserve volume of the lungs to increase tidal volume and by increasing respiratory rate (Figure 3.1). In COPD, because the expiratory airflow is reduced, the lungs empty slowly. As a result, the lungs become overinflated with air trapped in the alveoli, particularly when the respiratory rate increases. This hyperinflation compromises the use of the inspiratory reserve volume and breathlessness worsens. As the diaphragm flattens when the lungs are overinflated, the accessory muscles of respiration become increasingly important. The loss of alveolar/capillary surface in COPD, particularly in emphysema, increases the ventilation required to excrete the carbon dioxide that is generated during exercise, and this further increases the sensation of breathlessness.
Although breathlessness in COPD increases with exertion, it is nearly constant with time. Some patients do report variation, however; particularly that breathlessness is worse in the morning. Episodes of marked worsening, termed exacerbations, may be precipitated by acute infections. Exacerbations are distinct events and exceed the minimal day to day variation in symptoms.
Breathlessness is usually first noted while climbing hills or stairs, carrying heavy loads or hurrying on level ground. The appearance of breathlessness heralds moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. By the time the patient seeks medical advice, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) has usually fallen to around 1-1.5 liters in an average man (30-45% of the expected value). Patients with COPD may adapt their breathing pattern and their behavior to minimize the sensation of breathlessness. Generally, this takes the form of greatly restricted activity.
The perception of breathlessness varies greatly between individuals with the same degree of ventilatory capacity. Breathlessness can be assessed using the modified Borg Scale (Table 3.1), a visual analog scale, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale (Table 3.2), or the Dyspnea-12 scale. Mood is an important determinant of the perception of breathlessness in patients with COPD. When the FEV has fallen to 30% or less of the predicted value (equivalent in an average man to an FEV of around 1 liter), breathlessness is usually present on minimal exertion. Severe breathlessness is often affected by changes in temperature and by exposure to dust and fumes. Position has a variable effect on breathlessness. Some patients have severe orthopnea, relieved by leaning forward, whereas others find the greatest ease when lying flat.
Cough and sputum production. Up to 50% of cigarette smokers have a productive cough. It may either precede or appear simultaneously with the onset of breathlessness, and occurs in association with breathlessness in 75% of patients with COPD. The mMRC symptom questionnaire, which is used in epidemiological studies, employs cough as a defining symptom of chronic bronchitis, meaning a cough that produces sputum on most days for 3 consecutive months over 2 consecutive years.
Cessation of cigarette smoking produces resolution of the cough in over 90% of smokers; however, the airflow limitation often persists. Cough is often worse in the morning and, in contrast to asthma, nocturnal cough does not appear to be increased in stable COPD. In the presence of severe airway obstruction, the generation of high intrathoracic pressures may produce syncope during paroxysms of cough and 'cough fractures' of the ribs. Cough may also be exacerbated by gastroesophageal reflux.
Sputum production is a common, though not universal, feature of COPD. Sputum is usually white or gray in color, but may become mucopurulent and green or yellow in color during exacerbations. However, some patients with COPD have persistently purulent sputum; this may relate to bacterial colonization in the airway. Indeed, it is now recognized that a number of such patients have underlying bronchiectasis. Excessive sputum production (more than 60 mL/day) should raise the possibility of bronchiectasis.
Hemoptysis can occur in exacerbations of COPD in association with infection, but should always be treated seriously, since the incidence of bronchial carcinoma is high in patients with COPD. The production of copious amounts of frothy sputum, particularly in association with orthopnea or hypertension and/or ischemic heart disease, raises the possibility of left ventricular failure and pulmonary edema.
Wheeze is common in COPD, but is not universally present and is a non-specific symptom. It is not easy to evaluate because of its intermittent nature and the difficulties patients experience in understanding this symptom. Wheeze is due to turbulent airflow through the larger airways as a result of various causes including bronchial smooth muscle contraction, structural airway narrowing and the presence of excess airway secretions. Wheeze does not usually wake patients with COPD at night as it does those with asthma. The absence of signs of wheeze on auscultation of the chest does not exclude a diagnosis of COPD.
Other symptoms. Chest pain is common in patients with COPD, but is often unrelated to the disease itself, and may be due to underlying ischemic heart disease or gastroesophageal reflux. Patients with COPD often complain of chest tightness during exacerbations of breathlessness, particularly during exercise, and this is sometimes difficult to distinguish from ischemic cardiac pain. Pleuritic chest pain may suggest an intercurrent pneumothorax, pneumonia or pulmonary infarction.
Weight loss is a feature of severe COPD and is thought to result from anorexia, decreased calorie intake and increased metabolism.
Psychiatric morbidity, particularly depression, is common in patients with severe COPD, which is likely to reflect the social isolation and the chronicity of the disease. Sleep quality is impaired in advanced COPD, which may contribute to the impaired neuropsychiatric performance.
A detailed history is important in COPD and should include:
full smoking history
exposure to other risk factors, particularly gases or dusts, and an occupational history
medical history including asthma, allergy, sinusitis, nasal polyps, respiratory infection in childhood and other respiratory diseases
family history of COPD or other chronic respiratory disease
symptom development
exacerbations or previous hospitalizations for respiratory disorders
presence of comorbidity
appropriateness of current medical treatment
effect of the disease on the patient's life, including limitation of activity, work days lost and economic impact, effect on family and feelings of depression or anxiety
social and family support available to the patient.
As well as comorbidities commonly associated with COPD that should be addressed in their own right, the patient may have comorbidities such as heart disease that may further contribute to the restriction of activity (Table 3.3).
COPD is most common among smokers and after the age of 40. The presence of symptoms or signs in non-smokers or in younger individuals does not exclude COPD, but should raise suspicion of another condition and lead to a review of the other possible diagnoses or increased genetic susceptibility to COPD, such as alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (see page 28). Importantly, there is, in general, a dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked and the FEV; however, huge individual variations (see Figure 2.1) reflect the varying susceptibility to cigarette smoke.
Occupational exposure to dusts has an additive effect on the decline in lung function. This has particularly been shown in coal miners in whom both smoking and years of dust exposure contribute to the decline in FEV. Similar additive effects have been observed with air pollution. The contribution of smoking, however, is three times as great as that of dust exposure in miners.
Physical signs
The physical signs seen in patients with COPD are not specific to the disease. They depend on the degree of airflow limitation and pulmonary overinflation, and may be virtually absent in patients with mild-to-moderate disease, so their sensitivity in detecting or excluding COPD is poor. Physical signs of airflow limitation are rarely present until lung function is significantly impaired. Detection of early COPD is possible only by spirometry or by imaging techniques, such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to detect emphysema.
Breathing pattern. Patients with COPD often have a characteristic breathing pattern with a prolonged expiratory phase, although this is usually present only when disease is severe. Some patients adopt purse-lipped breathing on expiration, which may reduce expiratory airway collapse. The use of the accessory muscles of respiration, particularly the sternomastoids, is often seen in advanced disease; these patients often lean forward, supporting themselves with their arms to fix the shoulder girdle, thus allowing the use of the pectorals and the latissimus dorsi to increase chest wall movement.
Signs of overinflation include:
increased anterior/posterior diameter of the chest, which when greater than the lateral diameter is described as a 'barrel-shaped chest'
horizontal ribs with prominent sternal angle and wide subcostal angle
reduced distance between the suprasternal notch and the cricoid cartilage (normally three finger-breadths)
inspiratory tracheal tug
Hoover's sign, which is when the horizontal position of the diaphragm acts to pull in the lower ribs during inspiration
increased intrathoracic pressure swings, which may result in indrawing of the suprasternal and supraclavicular fossae and the intercostal muscles
decreased hepatic and cardiac dullness on percussion of the chest; the absence of a dull percussion note, normally due to the underlying heart, over the lower end of the sternum, is a useful sign of gross overinflation.
Breath sounds may have a prolonged expiratory phase, or may be uniformly diminished, particularly in the advanced stages of the disease. Wheeze may be heard by the unaided ear, at the patient's mouth if necessary, and may be variably present on auscultation both on inspiration and expiration. Crackles may be present, particularly at the lung bases, but are usually scanty, vary with coughing and cannot be distinguished from the coarse crackles of bronchiectasis or the fine respiratory crackles of fibrosis or left ventricular failure.
Different degrees of tachypnea may be present in patients with severe COPD, and prolonged forced expiratory time (> 5 seconds) can be a useful indicator of airway obstruction.
Physical appearance. In advanced disease, cyanosis may be present, indicating hypoxemia, but may be influenced by the background lighting or accentuated by polycythemia, and therefore is a fairly subjective sign. The flapping tremor associated with hypercapnia is neither sensitive nor specific, and the often reported papilledema associated with severe hypercapnia is in fact rarely seen.
Weight loss may be apparent in advanced disease, as well as a reduction in muscle mass.
Finger clubbing is not a manifestation of COPD and should suggest the possibility of complicating bronchial neoplasm, bronchiectasis or lung fibrosis.
Cardiovascular signs. Overinflation of the chest makes it difficult to locate the apex beat and reduces the cardiac dullness. The characteristic signs indicative of the presence or consequences of pulmonary arterial hypertension may be difficult to detect in advanced disease. The heave of right ventricular hypertrophy may be palpable at the lower left sternal edge or in the subcostal angle. Heart sounds are generally soft, though the second heart sound may be exaggerated in the second left intercostal space in the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Splitting of the second heart sound with an increased pulmonary component may be present. There may be a right-sided gallop rhythm, with a third sound audible in the fourth intercostal space to the left of the sternum or in the epigastrium.
The jugular venous pressure can be difficult to assess in patients with COPD as it varies widely with respiration and is difficult to discern because of the prominent accessory muscle activity. When the fluid retention of cor pulmonale occurs, there may be evidence of functional tricuspid incompetence, producing a pansystolic murmur at the left sternal edge.
Peripheral vasodilation accompanies hypercapnia, producing warm peripheries with a high-volume pulse. Pitting peripheral edema may be present as a result of fluid retention. However, other causes of edema, such as venous stasis, low serum albumin and deep venous thrombosis, should be considered.
Hepatic signs. The liver may be tender and pulsatile, and a prominent 'v' wave may be visible in the jugular venous pulse. The liver may also be palpable below the right costal margin as a result of the low diaphragm due to overinflation of the lungs.
Skin signs. Wrinkling of the skin has been associated with the presence of emphysema.
Clinical presentation
Many smokers accept the development of exertional dyspnea and cough with sputum production as an inevitable consequence of the smoking habit, and therefore often present to their doctor when the disease is at a fairly advanced stage. Relatively few patients are diagnosed early in the course of the disease. All smokers should quit. However, repeated spirometry over the course of several years will identify smokers with a rapid decline in FEV whose function may still be normal, who could be targeted for smoking cessation and early therapeutic intervention.
Some patients present initially to hospital or to their primary care provider during an exacerbation of the disease and claim that they had no significant symptoms until that time. However, close questioning often reveals the presence of progressive symptoms.
Two clinical patterns have been described, both of which represent severe disease - the so-called 'pink puffers' and 'blue bloaters'. The pink and puffing patient is thin and breathless with blood gas values that are preserved until late in the course of the disease, and therefore does not develop pulmonary hypertension until the disease is very advanced. By contrast, the blue and bloated patient develops hypoxemia and hypercapnia earlier, and thus also the complications of edema and secondary polycythemia. These 'phenotypes' are not indicative of emphysema or bronchitis, as was once thought, but clearly indicate the varied systemic manifestations of COPD. These subtypes of COPD, however, only partially capture the heterogeneity of the diseases. Most patients lie between these two extremes, and many patients fit neither pattern.
Systemic effects and comorbidities
Traditionally, COPD is regarded as a disease of the lungs characterized by progressive symptoms and a decline in lung function. Therapeutic strategies such as bronchodilators and inhaled glucocorticosteroids have therefore been used for relieving symptoms in association with improving airflow limitation. However, COPD is also associated with a number of systemic effects and common comorbidities (see Table 3.3), which may be present at any stage of the disease. Some of these comorbidities arise independent of COPD, whereas others appear to be causally related, either as a result of shared risk factors or the influence of COPD on the development of another condition. Systemic inflammation in COPD may be the link between COPD and some of its comorbidities.
Comorbid conditions have an important effect on morbidity and mortality, and should be comprehensively assessed and managed in all patients with COPD. In general, comorbidities should be treated in the same way as in patients without COPD.
Skeletal muscle dysfunction. Exercise limitation is a common complaint in COPD and is usually explained on the basis of the increased work of breathing caused by airflow limitation. However, almost 50% of patients with COPD stop exercising because of leg fatigue, not because of breathlessness. This suggests that skeletal muscle dysfunction is an important factor in the symptom complex. Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a good predictor of poor exercise performance, correlating more strongly than either lung function or blood gas measurements. This dysfunction is not entirely caused by a sedentary lifestyle, but the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood; limited oxygen delivery or cellular changes in the skeletal muscle due to the inflammatory processes underlying COPD may be implicated.
Weight loss is experienced by many patients with COPD during the course of their disease (see Figure 2.4). This phenomenon is of prognostic value, and is independent of the more traditional prognostic factors related to FEV and the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO).
The mechanisms underlying the weight loss are unclear, but may be related to the increased metabolic rate, tissue hypoxia and systemic inflammation.
Cardiovascular disease is the most common and probably the most important comorbidity in patients with COPD. General population studies and studies in patients with COPD suggest that COPD is an important risk factor for ischemic heart disease and sudden cardiac death. Indeed, the FEV is an established predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction are underdiagnosed and consequently are often undertreated in patients with COPD. The mechanism responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with COPD is unknown, but hypotheses include the effect of systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction.
Heart failure occurs in around 30% of patients with stable COPD and is an important differential diagnosis in exacerbations of COPD. Compromise of ventricular filling, in part due to hyperinflation, and compromise of the pulmonary circulation may contribute to diastolic dysfunction.
Hypertension is the most frequent comorbidity in COPD and has an adverse effect on prognosis.
Osteoporosis is more common in patients with COPD than in the general population. This may be due, in part, to concurrent smoking and to the use of corticosteroids. COPD itself appears to be associated with bone mineral loss and there is a particular association with emphysema and a low body mass index.
Psychiatric problems, particularly depression and anxiety, are common among patients with COPD and are associated with a poor prognosis. Studies suggest that both prevalent and incident depression is more common among patients with COPD than among similarly aged individuals with other diseases of similar morbidity. Anxiety and depression in patients with COPD are associated with younger age, female sex, greater airflow limitation, reduced health-related quality of life and a history of cardiovascular disease.
Diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are more common in patients with COPD than the general population and the presence of diabetes has an adverse effect on prognosis.
Lung cancer. COPD, in particular emphysema, also increases the risk of lung cancer, which is the commonest cause of death in patients with mild airflow limitation. The mechanism is again unclear, but may result from common risk factors such as smoking, the involvement of susceptibility genes or failure to clear carcinogens.
Other respiratory conditions. With the increased use of CT scanning, bronchiectasis is increasingly recognized in patients with COPD and is associated with longer exacerbations and a poor prognosis.
A significant proportion of patients with chronic airflow limitation have features suggestive of both COPD and asthma. The term 'asthma COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS)' has been used to describe these patients. The prevalence of this syndrome is estimated to be between 15% and 50% of patients depending on the defining criteria. There are no recognized defining features for ACOS, but patients with features of both COPD and asthma have poor health-related quality of life, frequent exacerbations, a more rapid decline in lung function and a higher mortality.
Systemic inflammation. COPD is characterized by an excessive inflammatory process in the lung parenchyma in response to inhaled particles or gases. Evidence of inflammation has also been detected in the systemic circulation, such as markers of oxidative stress, elevated levels of cytokines and activation of circulating leukocytes. Systemic inflammation has been associated with some COPD comorbidities and a poor prognosis.
Spectrum of disease
Many national and international guidelines for COPD have used a simple classification of disease severity based on spirometry. However, because FEV only partially captures the severity of COPD, recent recommendations suggest assessing additional measures. The most recent classification from the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) takes into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation (Figure 3.2). First, the patient's symptoms are assessed using the COPD assessment test (CAT) or the modified MRC score (mMRC) for dyspnea (see Table 3.2). The CAT is the preferred test as it provides a comprehensive assessment of symptoms (www.catestonline.org). A CAT score of 10 or more indicates a high level of symptoms. Exacerbation risk is then assessed in three ways: by the severity of airflow limitation as indicated by spirometry grade, with a GOLD classification of 3 or 4 indicating high risk (see Table 4.1); by the patient's history of exacerbations, with two or more exacerbations in the preceding year indicating high risk; and by the patient's history of hospitalization in the preceding year. The highest risk parameter should be recorded for the purposes of this assessment. Alternatively, the COPD Foundation Guide recommends assessing seven independent domains of severity (Table 3.4).","<BULL> COPD occurs, though less commonly, in those who do not smoke. <BULL> Usually (in 80% of patients) there is a significant smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. For those with lesser smoking histories or for younger individuals, consider an alternative diagnosis or a genetic predisposition (exempli gratia alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency). <BULL> The most common symptom in COPD is breathlessness on exertion. <BULL> Dyspnea may be discounted by patients until disease is severe, as breathlessness can be avoided by restricting activity. <BULL> Physical signs often present only at an advanced stage of the disease. <BULL> Clinical indicators include signs of overinflation, prominent use of accessory muscles of respiration, weight loss, expiratory wheeze, cyanosis, peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure.

9781908541406,ch_6,"Platelet disorders
Platelet function defects
Inherited disorders. Although uncommon, congenital platelet disorders have been described involving platelet membrane glycoproteins, storage granules and dense bodies (Table 4.1). Some disorders give rise to relatively mild bleeding symptoms, often with normal platelet counts, and the diagnosis may not be made until the patient is well into adult life, usually following excessive bleeding after surgery (exempli gratia dental extraction) or trauma. Some congenital platelet disorders are also associated with morphologically abnormal platelets and thrombocytopenia.
Mutations in membrane glycoproteins. Bernard-Soulier syndrome is due to mutations in membrane glycoprotein Ib-IX-V. The disorder is characterized by thrombocytopenia, large platelets and impaired binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Patients with this syndrome have prolonged bleeding time, defective platelet adhesion and impaired platelet aggregation in response to ristocetin. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with a history of bleeding and a reduced platelet count, and confirmed by reviewing platelet morphology and observing reduced ristocetin-induced aggregation, but normally functioning VWF.
Glanzmann thrombasthenia is due to qualitative or quantitative deficiencies in the platelet membrane fibrinogen receptor alphaIIbbeta3, an integrin encoded by the ITGA2B and ITGB3 genes. It is characterized by excessive menstrual blood loss, bleeding from mucous membranes and major hemorrhage following trauma and surgery. Patients have a normal platelet count, but greatly impaired clot retraction, and agents such as adenosine diphosphate (ADP), epinephrine (adrenaline) and collagen fail to induce platelet aggregation.
Defects in platelet storage organelles or granules. One form of platelet storage pool disease is due to the absence of dense bodies, which are organelles containing ADP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), calcium and serotonin. Patients exhibit excessive bruising and bleeding after surgery or trauma as the platelets may fail to exhibit a secondary wave of aggregation in response to a variety of aggregating agents. The absence of dense bodies in the platelets can be demonstrated by electron microscopy or by measuring the intraplatelet levels of ADP and ATP. In some patients, this form of storage pool disease is inherited together with tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism and ceroid pigment deposition in various organs, including the kidney. This constellation is termed the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and is due to mutations in HPS1-8, genes affecting organelle biosynthesis and protein trafficking. Another form of storage pool disease, the gray platelet syndrome, is characterized by a lack of platelet alpha-granules and absence of platelet fibrinogen, fibronectin and thrombospondin.
Dysfunction of cytosolic enzymes and other platelet constituents. Cyclooxygenase defects result in impaired platelet aggregation and release of ADP from dense granules in response to ADP and collagen, and are associated with a mild bleeding tendency. As acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) inhibits cyclooxygenase and gives rise to similar clinical and laboratory features, cyclooxygenase deficiency is sometimes known as an 'aspirin-like defect'. A variety of other forms of inherited platelet dysfunction have been described; examples are platelet-type von Willebrand disease, collagen receptor deficiency and the Chediak-Higashi and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes.
Diagnosis. Inspection of the blood film will reveal whether the platelet count is normal (as in many mild platelet function disorders) or decreased, and if the appearance of the platelets or white cells is abnormal, exempli gratia large platelets and leukocyte Döhle bodies in the May-Hegglin anomaly (see Figure 2.3). Table 4.2 shows how thrombocytopenia due to congenital disorders is differentiated from acquired causes.
Management. Patients with inherited platelet function defects should avoid ASA (aspirin) and other drugs that alter platelet function. In addition, chronic blood loss may necessitate iron supplementation. Women usually require hormonal therapy to control menorrhagia. Patients should carry documentation describing the nature of their bleeding defect with them at all times. Some of the inherited platelet disorders, such as the gray platelet syndrome, may respond temporarily to treatment with desmopressin. If platelet transfusions are needed, single-donor platelets are usually preferred. Patients with Glanzmann syndrome often become refractory to platelets because they develop anti-alphaIIbbeta3 and also anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. Registries indicate that hemostasis has been secured in some of these patients with recombinant human factor (F)VIIa.
Acquired disorders. Defective platelet function can be caused by alcohol, drugs, uremia and myeloproliferative disorders. Alcohol alone does not appear to affect platelet function, though it may reduce the platelet count; it does, however, strongly potentiate the inhibitory effects of ASA (aspirin). Antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, can alter the platelet membrane and prolong the skin bleeding time. Minoxidil inhibits the synthesis of platelet prostaglandins. Valproic acid lowers the platelet count, prolongs the bleeding time and impairs platelet aggregation. The black tree fungus, used in Szechuan cooking, inhibits platelet aggregation. The effects of drugs used therapeutically (exempli gratia ASA [aspirin], clopidogrel) and uremic bleeding are discussed in Chapters 13 and, respectively.
Primary (essential) thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative disorder that results from a clonal proliferation of stem cells. JAK2 mutations are observed in 50-60% of patients. Megakaryocytes proliferate, resulting in an increased number of circulating platelets, which may have defective function. It is predominantly a disease of the elderly, but 20% of patients are under 40 years of age, and more women than men are affected. Thrombotic events are more common than bleeding, which occurs in about 4% of patients. Bruises, bleeding gums and major gastrointestinal hemorrhage occur. The spleen may be enlarged, and the peripheral blood smear often shows giant agranular or hypogranular platelets. A variety of platelet function defects involving the platelet membrane, granules and enzymatic pathways have been described. Treatment in symptomatic patients is directed toward reducing the platelet count using agents such as hydroxyurea, alpha-interferon and anagrelide.
The normal platelet count ranges from 150-350 x 10 /L; thrombocytopenia is defined as a count of less than 150 x 10 /L and may be mild, moderate or severe (Table 4.3). Bleeding seldom occurs with platelet counts greater than 50 x 10 /L, and is usually minor with counts exceeding 10 x 10 /L. Spontaneous bleeding and bleeding requiring medical attention usually indicate that the platelet count is less than 10 x 10 /L. However, clinical bleeding often does not correlate with the platelet count because other factors, such as the integrity of the endothelium and the function of the residual platelets, affect hemostasis.
Diagnosis. Careful scrutiny of a freshly prepared blood film is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of thrombocytopenia. The first step is to confirm that the platelet count is truly decreased and then to detect whether other blood abnormalities are present. Pseudothrombocytopenia occurs when platelets undergo agglutination on exposure to cold, form satellites around leukocytes or clump in the presence of anticoagulants, such as ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) or heparin. Under these conditions, automated counters do not recognize platelets and record a spuriously low platelet count. However, clumps of platelets may be seen on the feather-edge of blood films, indicating a higher platelet count than that reported. In these circumstances, repeating the count using freshly drawn blood or using citrate anticoagulant may provide a more accurate estimate of platelet numbers.
Examination of the blood smear will also provide information about platelet size. Large platelets are present in congenital thrombocytopenias, such as Bernard-Soulier syndrome and May-Hegglin anomaly (see Figure 2.3), or may indicate an increase in platelet turnover as in the immune thrombocytopenias and consumption syndromes. Small platelets occur in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The red cells and white cells should also be examined: fragmented red cells may suggest a thrombotic microangiopathy and hypogranular neutrophils suggest myelodysplasia.
Once a diagnosis of thrombocytopenia has been established, it is imperative to ascertain an exact etiology. Determining the time of onset of the condition by asking whether the patient ever had a normal platelet count helps to exclude congenital thrombocytopenias. A careful history to determine recent exposure to alcohol, herbal medications or other tonics, quinine water or unusual foods and other drugs may implicate a culprit agent. Viral infections, such as HIV or cytomegalovirus, are often associated with thrombocytopenia.
Postoperative thrombocytopenias are usually dilutional, because replacement fluids lack platelets, and often resolve within a few days. On the other hand, thrombocytopenias may be persistent in patients who have had cardiac surgery involving the use of aortic balloon pump devices or in patients with leaky heart valves, and may not improve until the pump is removed or the valve repaired. Severe thrombocytopenia may result from the use of platelet glycoprotein inhibitors during coronary angioplasty and stenting.
If such features are absent from the history, an immune thrombocytopenia is most likely. Most often this is an autoimmune disorder, such as primary immune thrombocytopenia (formerly called immune or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), but other possibilities such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and post-transfusion purpura should be considered.
In evaluating a patient with thrombocytopenia, it is useful to consider the clinical setting (Table 4.4). For example, a young woman presenting with new onset of bleeding from the nose and mouth, vaginal bleeding and petechiae probably has primary immune thrombocytopenia, whereas an asymptomatic pregnant woman with a platelet count of 100 x 10 /L probably has benign incidental thrombocytopenia. An acute decline in platelet count in a patient undergoing treatment for cardiac, rheumatologic or infectious disease suggests that a drug may be responsible. Thrombocytopenia in association with an acute illness, such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome, usually indicates platelet consumption, and may be accompanied by signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Thrombocytopenia accompanied by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (with fragmented red cells visible on the blood film) and evidence of thrombosis warrant a consideration of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or hemolytic-uremic syndrome. On the other hand, a previously healthy person who presents with pancytopenia may have aplastic anemia or leukemia; enlargement of the spleen may suggest liver disease, myelofibrosis or a storage disorder such as Gaucher disease.
Primary immune thrombocytopenia was previously thought to affect mostly young women but, with the aging of the population, it is increasingly being recognized in the elderly, with men and women equally affected. The overall incidence is 2.5 per 100 000, but in those over 60 incidence increases to 4.5 per 100 000.
Diagnosis. In many patients, thrombocytopenia is discovered when a complete blood count is performed as part of a periodic health examination; however, others may notice a petechial rash or oral bleeding and consult their physician. A complete history should be obtained, focusing on symptoms such as fever, pain or weight loss, recent respiratory infections or HIV risk factors, and consumption of alcohol or quinine, either as a treatment for muscle cramps or in tonic water. Detailed inquiry should be made about recent exposure to drugs or herbal medicines. On physical examination, signs of bleeding such as petechiae (Figure 4.1), subconjunctival hemorrhage (Figure 4.2), ecchymoses and hemorrhagic bullae in the oral cavity should be sought. Evidence of systemic disorders, such as signs of recent weight loss, hypothyroidism, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, should also be noted. A complete blood count indicates the severity of the thrombocytopenia; a concomitant hypochromic microcytic anemia may be present if bleeding has been chronic, but the leukocyte count is generally normal. As noted previously, examination of the blood film is mandatory to confirm the thrombocytopenia and exclude other hematologic disorders.
The American Society of Hematology's 2011 evidence-based guidelines do not recommend a bone marrow examination in patients newly diagnosed with primary immune thrombocytopenia, provided the history and physical examination are unremarkable and the blood count shows only thrombocytopenia and/or findings of iron deficiency. However, all patients should be tested for hepatitis C and HIV.
Treatment. If the platelet count is greater than 50 x 10 /L, no treatment is required and patients may simply be observed at regular intervals. In children, primary immune thrombocytopenia is usually an acute self-limiting condition and, provided there is no frank or persistent bleeding, drug therapy may not be necessary. In adults, however, the thrombocytopenia may be more prolonged and specific treatment may be required. Table 4.5 shows some of the agents used for the management of symptomatic primary immune thrombocytopenia.
Steroids. If the platelet count is less than 30 x 10 /L or there is bleeding, prednisone (prednisolone), 1 mg/kg, is given. Patients with platelet counts of less than 20 x 10 /L are generally hospitalized; if there is considerable bleeding, methylprednisolone may be given intravenously. Once the platelet count has increased to over 30 x 10 /L, the dose of corticosteroid is tapered slowly to avoid a rapid relapse. The goal is to prevent recurrence of bleeding by maintaining the platelet count above 20 x 10 /L. If the dose of corticosteroid required to accomplish this is greater than 10-20 mg/day, other interventions, such as those listed below, may be required. Although a rise in the platelet count with oral steroids may not be observed for 5-7 days, bleeding often subsides within a day or two. Some physicians prescribe intravenous immunoglobulin, in addition to corticosteroids, to increase the platelet count more rapidly if there is significant or high potential for serious bleeding.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) G. For severely symptomatic children, a single dose of IVIgG, 0.8-1 g/kg, is often used in the USA, whereas treatment with steroids is usually initiated in the UK. Adult patients are given IVIg, 1 g/kg/day for 2 days or 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days; however, IVIg should always be given slowly, over 4-6 hours, to avoid anaphylactic reactions. Renal function should be monitored as renal failure induced by IVIg has been reported; this might have been a result of the high sucrose content of early preparations. A lower incidence has been reported for more recent preparations manufactured without the addition of sucrose. Responses to IVIg usually occur within 24-48 hours, but the effect usually is short lived and relapses are common.
Splenectomy. Second-line therapies include splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and rituximab; however, splenectomy is more definitive and is given a grade 1B (strength of evidence) recommendation, indicating a high degree of confidence that the intervention will result in a desirable outcome. As early as possible before surgery, patients are immunized against pneumococcal infection and Haemophilus influenza, and some centers also administer meningococcal vaccines. Preoperatively, the platelet count is raised by administering high doses of corticosteroid. Methylprednisolone, up to 30 mg/kg, may be given by slow intravenous infusion daily for 1-2 days; the platelet count will often increase to more than 50 x 10 /L within 48 hours. Alternatively, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist can be given to increase platelet counts to levels sufficient for surgical hemostasis.
Thrombopoietin receptor agonists such as romiplostim and eltrombopag are recommended for patients at risk of bleeding who relapse after splenectomy, have a contraindication for splenectomy or for whom at least one other therapy has failed. Romiplostim is given weekly by subcutaneous injection in doses based on bodyweight, and eltrombopag is given in a daily oral dose. Platelet numbers can fluctuate widely until a dose is achieved that produces counts within the desired range (Figure 4.3). Adverse effects include ischemic events if there is a sustained increase in the platelet count above normal levels; conversely, the count can decline swiftly if treatment is abruptly discontinued.
Rituximab. This chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody depletes B cells; it provides 40-70% overall response rates and nearly 40% sustained remissions. In previously untreated patients this can be increased to 60% by combining rituximab with dexamethasone, 40 mg daily for 4 days. Adverse effects occur in about 10% of patients, but are usually not severe.
Thrombotic microangiopathies include thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, hemolytic anemia with elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome in pregnancy and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. They are not bleeding disorders, but are accompanied by thrombocytopenia. The clinical picture reflects ischemic injury to one or more organs or tissues: the brain, heart and kidney in thrombocytopenic purpura; the kidney in hemolytic-uremic syndrome; the liver in HELLP; and limb or bowel gangrene in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.
Laboratory evaluation reveals microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with red cell fragmentation and reticulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and raised levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Thrombocytopenic purpura is treated by plasma exchange, hemolytic-uremic syndrome by withdrawal of drugs (ciclosporin) or removal of Shiga toxins, HELLP by delivery of the fetus and placenta, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia by cessation of heparin and administration of alternative antithrombotic agents. Novel agents, such as rituximab for thrombocytopenic purpura and eculizumab for hemolytic-uremic syndrome and HELLP, should also be considered.
Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy (see Chapter 10). Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100-150 x 10 /L) is observed in 6-10% of pregnancies. It is usually a benign incidental finding, but it may be associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a manifestation of primary immune thrombocytopenia or a pseudothrombocytopenia due to platelet clumping in vitro. Pseudothrombocytopenia can be excluded by examining the peripheral smear for platelet clumps. The true platelet count can be assessed by platelet quantitation immediately after the blood is drawn, as the platelets may agglutinate while the blood is standing at room temperature. Occasionally, drawing the blood into citrate anticoagulant, rather than EDTA, will provide a more accurate platelet count.
Once it has been established that the patient has a true thrombocytopenia, the benign gestational thrombocytopenias that account for 75% of cases must be differentiated from the uncommon primary immune thrombocytopenia that accounts for 4% of cases (Table 4.6).
Benign gestational thrombocytopenia does not require treatment; observation alone is adequate. However, primary immune thrombocytopenia during pregnancy may become more severe as pregnancy progresses. Monthly infusions of IVIg, with or without corticosteroids, may be needed to prevent bleeding, and if epidural anesthesia is required for delivery the platelet count should be increased to 75 000/µL or higher for safe placement of the epidural catheter. A platelet count should be obtained from the infant, preferably from the cord blood, immediately after delivery, and repeated daily for the first week. If the infant has a platelet count of less than 20 x 10 /L or is bleeding, IVIg infusions should be given. The thrombocytopenia usually resolves within 1-2 weeks. Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is discussed in Chapter 10.
Thrombocytopenia associated with hepatitis C virus and HIV. Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or HIV infection, but spontaneous bleeding is rare, even if the platelet count is severely depressed. Several mechanisms for the thrombocytopenia have been established, including splenic sequestration, formation of immune complexes and viral infection of megakaryocytes. In the later stages of HIV infection, atrophy of the marrow may occur, with pancytopenia. Platelet counts will often increase gradually when effective antiretroviral therapy is given. A more rapid increase in platelet count occurs with infusions of anti-D or IVIg. Eltrombopag increases platelet counts in some patients with HCV infection, enabling them to receive a full course of interferon therapy.
Iatrogenic causes of thrombocytopenia
Drug causes are uncommon, with an estimated population incidence of 1-2 cases per 100 000 per year. Drugs implicated in thrombocytopenia either decrease platelet production or induce platelet-directed antibodies. Heparin is probably the most frequent cause of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, but heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with thrombosis rather than bleeding. Other drugs strongly implicated in the development of thrombocytopenia are listed in Table 4.7. In addition, disparate agents such as alemtuzumab, pulped sesame seeds and Chinese herbal medicines have provoked acute thrombocytopenia.
A variety of mechanisms underlie drug-induced thrombocytopenia, including binding to the platelet membrane glycoproteins and stimulating the production of hapten-dependent antibodies that recognize drug-protein targets. Heparin induces a conformational change in platelet factor 4, exposing neoantigens, which elicit antibodies. Other drugs, such as quinidine and sulfonamides, induce antibodies that bind to platelet glycoproteins in the presence of the drug or one of its metabolites; some of these antibodies bind to megakaryocytes and inhibit proplatelet production.
Abciximab, a 'humanized' mouse monoclonal antibody directed against glycoprotein alphaIIbbeta3, may stimulate antibodies that react with abciximab-coated platelets and are specific for murine protein. Finally, small molecule inhibitors of platelet glycoprotein alphaIIbbeta3 elicit antibodies that recognize multiple epitopes on the glycoprotein when it is complexed with the inhibitor; these antibodies may be directed against the ligand-binding site.
Non-drug causes. Post-transfusion purpura occurs when individuals lacking the platelet PL AI antigen, an antigen present in over 97% of the population, are transfused with blood products containing this antigen. In a strong antibody response the antibodies cross-react with the patient's own platelets and produce a severe thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia has even occurred when organs from a PL AI -antigen-negative individual are transplanted into a PL AI -antigen-positive recipient; the antibody response is presumably mediated by donor lymphocytes carried within the organs.
Management of thrombocytopenia. All new medications or tonics should be discontinued and serial platelet counts obtained. If the patient is not bleeding, watchful waiting is appropriate. However, major or life-threatening hemorrhage necessitates platelet infusion. Important exceptions are thrombocytopenia associated with heparin and thrombocytopenic purpura; in these disorders, infused platelets worsen the thromboses and are contraindicated.
Platelet transfusions are indicated to:
control bleeding due to decreased platelet numbers or impaired platelet function
correct dilutional thrombocytopenia resulting from multi-unit transfusion of packed red cells in conjunction with surgery or trauma
prevent bleeding in individuals with thrombocytopenia undergoing invasive procedures or with recent bleeding into vital structures
prevent bleeding when invasive procedures are required in persons under treatment with potent inhibitors of platelet function (clopidogrel, prasugrel or drug combinations)
prevent bleeding in patients with platelet counts of less than 10 x 10 /L and impaired platelet production due to:
marrow replacement by malignancies
marrow depletion by chemotherapy or radiation
marrow impairment associated with hematopoietic cell transplantation.
Platelets may be obtained by plateletpheresis (single-donor platelets) or retrieved from donated whole blood (random-donor platelets). One apheresis unit is equivalent to six random-donor units in terms of platelet numbers. Each random-donor unit generally increases the platelet count by 5 x 10 /L, so that one apheresis unit or six random-donor units should provide a satisfactory increase in platelet count; this must be verified by performing a platelet count 1 hour and 24 hours after the infusion. This will also give some indication of the recovery and survival of the infused platelets.
Infusion of platelets can be associated with allergic reactions, which can be minimized by depleting the platelets of accompanying white cells. Transmission of infectious agents may also occur; careful donor assessment and screening for viruses in the donation will substantially reduce this risk. Platelet products must also be screened for bacterial contamination. Platelet sensitization is uncommon, even with random-donor platelets; if platelet alloimmunization develops, platelet cross-matching and giving HLA-matched platelets can be helpful.","<BULL> Thrombocytopenia may occur with some inherited disorders of platelet function, such as the Bernard-Soulier, gray platelet and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes. <BULL> Inhibitors of platelet function, such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), should be avoided in individuals with disorders of platelet function and those with thrombocytopenia. <BULL> In immune thrombocytopenia, bleeding is uncommon if the platelet count exceeds 10 x 10 /L and aggressive interventions (exempli gratia high-dose corticosteroids, splenectomy) are not usually indicated. <BULL> Gestational thrombocytopenia is common and requires no treatment, but it must be distinguished from primary immune thrombocytopenia. <BULL> Platelet transfusion has limited indications and should be used sparingly, because it may transmit infection or sensitize the recipient to platelet antigens.","Platelet disorders may be caused by a number of factors, such as the presence of platelet glycoproteins in the blood, and the presence of platelets in the platelet membrane. Some of these factors may be caused by the presence of a platelet glycoprotein in the blood. Some of the factors that may be caused by platelet glyoproteins, such as thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, and platelet aggregation may be caused by anaphylaxis. Some of these conditions may occur in patients who have had cardiac surgery involving the use of aortic balloon pump devices or in patients with leaky heart valves, and may not improve until the pump is removed or the valve repaired. Some congenital platelet disorders are also associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Some of these disorders may occur in patients with a variety of conditions, such as hemolytic-cytopenia, hemolytic-leukocytopenia and platelet aggregation. Others may occur in patients without a history of bleeding. Some of the conditions may be caused by thrombocytic-leukocyte aggregation.

9781908541277,ch_6,"The diagnosis of epilepsy relies on the correct classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndromes (see Chapter 2), with consequent implications for prognosis and choice of therapy.
Epilepsy is not a single disease but an extensive collection of conditions with a wide range of underlying etiologies and pathologies, all sharing the common and fundamental characteristic of recurrent, usually unprovoked, seizures. Figure 3.1 shows some common etiologies in relation to age.
The diagnostic procedure aims to answer three key questions.
Is the episode an epileptic seizure?
What is (are) the seizure type(s)?
What is the epilepsy syndrome?
Differential diagnosis
A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures and must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 3.1). For example, syncopal attacks, sometimes with clonic movements and incontinence, are commonly misdiagnosed as epileptic seizures. Furthermore, non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (also called pseudoseizures) are estimated to occur in up to 45% of patients referred to specialist centers with apparently refractory epilepsy. This misidentification of non-epileptic conditions as epilepsy can lead to unnecessary treatments that are potentially harmful, and can delay the start of appropriate therapy. The temptation to attach a label of 'epilepsy' should be resisted if there is any doubt about the diagnosis despite a thorough evaluation. Both the physician and patient must simply await the passage of time before coming to a firm conclusion. Further challenges of diagnosis and management may arise in patients in whom non-epileptic events coexist with epileptic seizures or develop as a substitute for epileptic seizures once the epilepsy is controlled.
Acute symptomatic seizures (also called provoked seizures) must be distinguished from unprovoked (epileptic) seizures. Acute symptomatic seizures occur in close temporal relationship (often arbitrarily defined as within 1 week) with an acute insult of the central nervous system (CNS), which may be metabolic, toxic, structural, traumatic, infectious or inflammatory. Common examples include seizures during an acute stroke, encephalitis or electrolyte disturbance. It has been estimated that up to 50% of all seizures may be considered to be acute symptomatic. There should be an adequate effort to search for any underlying acute CNS insult which may require urgent treatment. Unlike epileptic seizures, acute symptomatic seizures are not necessarily characterized by a tendency for recurrence. Therefore, as a general rule, long-term therapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is not indicated for most individuals, although it may be warranted on a short-term basis until the acute condition is resolved.
Clinical evaluation
Despite advances in investigational technologies, the diagnosis of epilepsy remains essentially clinical, and is based on a detailed description of the events experienced by the patient before, during and after a seizure. A witness's account of one or more of the episodes is an essential component of a confident diagnosis (Table 3.2).In addition to a full medical and social history, the patient should be asked about factors that may precipitate seizures by lowering the threshold for such an event (Table 3.3).
Physical examination is often unremarkable, although there may be focal neurological signs that correspond to an underlying structural abnormality in the brain. Investigations aiming to unearth anything that acutely provokes seizures should be guided by the clinical scenario. Routine blood tests should include full blood count and electrolytes, and an electrocardiogram should be performed to detect cardiac arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities, particularly prolonged QT syndromes. Drug screening may be carried out when the history suggests drug abuse. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid examination should be reserved for those suspected of having an acute CNS infection.
Investigational technologies
Electroencephalography can support the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and help with the classification of partial-onset or generalized seizures. It is important to give the electroencephalographer detailed information concerning the patient's age, seizure behavior and response to AEDs.
Routine EEGs are often insensitive - more than 50% of patients with epilepsy will have a normal trace. Activation techniques, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation (Figure 3.2),are helpful in uncovering abnormalities. Diagnostic yield can also be increased by repeat recordings. If the initial EEG is unremarkable and the diagnosis remains in doubt, a sleep-deprivation study is recommended.
Routine EEGs have a limited role in determining whether AED(s) can be safely tapered after a prolonged seizure-free interval. In a patient with suspected non-convulsive status epilepticus (see Chapter 7), an EEG can be diagnostic. An EEG can also immediately differentiate between epileptic and psychogenic convulsive status epilepticus.
Prolonged ambulatory recording. In cases of a negative routine EEG, better detection of interictal and ictal events may be achieved with a prolonged EEG recording using portable equipment. On the plus side, this allows recording to take place in the patient's usual environment, but technical faults are more likely and accurate correlation with simultaneous behaviors on video is available only with certain recording systems.
Video-EEG telemetry. Behavioral correlation can be achieved in inpatients by video monitoring during the EEG. This investigation is mandatory as part of the evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and may be the only way to distinguish epileptic from non-epileptic seizures.
Magnetoencephalography, in which the magnetic fields associated with the intracellular current flows within neurons are measured between seizures, has been the subject of recent research. In some situations, it usefully identifies candidates for surgery among patients with normal neuroimaging results.
EEG with functional MRI (fMRI). Advances in technology have allowed combined recording of EEG during fMRI, so that interictal EEG changes can be spatially localized. As a result, simultaneous EEG and fMRI provides the opportunity to better understand the spatiotemporal mechanisms of the generation of epileptiform activity in the brain. Its role in the clinical management of epilepsy, particularly in selection of surgical candidacy in the case of drug resistance, is an area of active research.
Brain imaging
Structural imaging. Imaging studies of the brain to look for underlying structural abnormalities are essential for the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of most patients with epilepsy, particularly those presenting with partial-onset seizures. The imaging modality of choice is MRI. It has higher sensitivity and specificity than CT for identifying structural lesions such as malformations of cortical development (Figure 3.3a), hippocampal sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangioma (Figure 3.3b) and low-grade gliomas (Figure 3.3c). CT should be performed if MRI is unavailable and in patients for whom MRI is contraindicated (exempli gratia those with cardiac pacemakers, non-compatible aneurysm clips or severe claustrophobia).
Typical pathological findings vary with age. In children, MRI is particularly useful in identifying congenital abnormalities, such as neuronal migration disorders and arteriovenous malformations. In young adults, frequently detected conditions are hippocampal sclerosis, sequelae of head trauma, congenital anomalies, brain tumors and vascular lesions. For patients in mid-life and beyond, scans are helpful in evaluating stroke and cerebral degeneration, and in identifying primary and secondary neoplasia.
Any patient with refractory epilepsy in whom the initial MRI scan is normal should have a high-resolution scan to exclude hippocampal atrophy and focal cortical dysplasia. The scan should be repeated periodically if there is one of the following:
suspicion of a tumor
worsening in the patient's neurological or cognitive function
increase in the frequency or severity of the seizures.
Functional imaging can identify focal abnormalities in cerebral physiology even when structural imaging results are normal. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate increased blood flow in brain regions in association with seizure activity. Epileptogenic areas can be detected as hypometabolic regions interictally by positron emission tomography (Figure 3.4). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure changes in chemical compounds in the brain associated with neuronal loss in certain epileptogenic pathologies.

9781910797815,chp3,"Diagnosis and disease burden
Accurate diagnosis and regular monitoring during treatment are key to the effective management of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Risk stratification is essential to guide treatment decisions, given that patients with these conditions have a variable risk of vascular complications (thrombosis and hemorrhage) and progression to myelofibrosis, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or, to a lesser extent, myelodysplasia.
Clinical presentation
The MPNs vary markedly in morphologic and clinical features (Table 3.1). Thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis are major diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV), respectively. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has a more variable presentation, which may include all the features of PV and ET; however, anemia is a common finding and work-up requires the differential diagnosis of anemia. Furthermore, PMF is generally associated with the most severe symptom burden among the MPNs, although patients with PV or ET often also have significant disease-related symptoms (see Table 3.1).
The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for MPNs (Tables 3.2 - 3.4) are based on peripheral blood counts, molecular abnormalities and alterations in bone marrow morphology, reflecting the central role of erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis in the pathophysiology of these conditions. The 2016 updated WHO criteria differ from the 2008 criteria in the following ways.
'True' ET and prefibrotic PMF are differentiated, reflecting the differences in outcome between these two conditions; bone marrow biopsy, raised lactate dehydrogenase, splenomegaly and blood film are critical in making this differentiation.
Hemoglobin and hematocrit thresholds for PV have been lowered and bone marrow morphology upgraded to a major criterion, in order to differentiate between so-called masked PV and JAK2 -mutant ET.
Prefibrotic and overt PMF are differentiated as distinct entities.
As noted in Chapter 2, some cases of familial MPN have been reported, and it may therefore be useful to interview patients to identify any family history, and to perform complete blood counts in apparently healthy relatives in families with such a history.
Diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia
Thrombocytosis is a major criterion for the diagnosis of ET (Table 3.2) but can also be present in other MPNs; the diagnostic approach to ET therefore generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. As shown in Figure 3.1, a patient with elevated platelet count (>= 450 x 10 /L) should undergo further blood testing, including a complete blood count, blood film/smear and determination of iron and C-reactive protein status, together with testing for MPN driver mutations and BCR-ABL1. The presence of a driver mutation might suggest a diagnosis of ET but bone marrow biopsy is required to preclude other MPNs such as PV, PMF or myelodysplastic syndrome.
Diagnosis of polycythemia vera
In contrast to ET, PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and PMF. The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PV are shown in Table 3.3 and an algorithm for the differential diagnosis in Figure 3.2.
Diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis
As noted above, the presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include:
symptomatic splenomegaly
constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus
thrombosis or bleeding
extramedullary hematopoiesis
bone pain.
Anemia is among the most common features of PMF, and hence the diagnosis is largely based on a differential diagnosis of anemia. Patients in whom PMF is suspected on the basis of clinical or laboratory findings should undergo genetic testing for driver mutations, followed by bone marrow biopsy to establish the diagnosis. The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PMF are shown in Table 3.4, and an algorithm for the differential diagnosis in Figure 3.3.
Disease burden
In addition to the risks of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to AML, the MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life. For example, an internet-based survey found that almost all of 1179 patients with myeloproliferative disorders reported some constitutional symptoms (Figure 3.4). The most common was fatigue, reported by 81% of patients, followed by pruritus (52%) and night sweats (49%). Furthermore, many patients reported decreased functioning, and 14% reported being disabled. With the exception of spleen pain, each of these symptoms was significantly more common in patients with PV or PMF than in those with ET.
Constitutional symptoms in patients with MPNs have a number of causes, including:
cytopenias, which lead to fatigue and decreased physical activity (which may further worsen fatigue)
dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, leading to an overall catabolic state characterized by night sweats, fevers and weight loss
splenomegaly, leading to abdominal discomfort and early satiety.
Importantly, novel therapies such as Janus kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) are effective in relieving the symptom burden in MPNs, in addition to reducing cytopenias and spleen size. Assessment of symptoms is therefore an essential aspect of treatment monitoring.
Risk stratification
Patients with MPNs are at risk of vascular complications such as hemorrhage and venous or arterial thrombosis. Moreover, PV (and ET to a lesser extent) has a risk of progression to secondary myelofibrosis, while PMF may progress to an AML-like blast phase, which may be preceded by a myelodysplastic phase. The extent to which an individual patient is at risk of vascular complications and disease progression is determined by multiple clinical and molecular risk factors (Table 3.5). Since the level of risk influences treatment decisions, risk stratification is essential in the management of MPNs.
ET is usually considered to have the best prognosis among the MPNs. Risk stratification focuses on the likelihood of thrombotic complications, and is based on the two main risk factors for thrombosis: age 60 years or older, and a previous thrombotic event. To date, two prognostic scoring systems have been developed for use in patients with ET:
the European LeukemiaNet system, which stratifies patients according to age, previous thrombosis and platelet count
the International Prognostic Score for ET (IPSET)-thrombosis, which also includes the presence of JAK2 V617F and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use to estimate the risk of thrombosis.
The characteristics of these scoring systems are summarized in Table 3.6. The IPSET model has also been used to estimate the likelihood of survival in patients with ET although this has not been validated prospectively.
In addition to age and history of thrombosis, JAK2 mutation status has been shown to be an independent predictor of thrombosis-free survival in patients with ET (see Chapter 4) but this is not currently included in risk stratification algorithms. A recent modification of IPSET-thrombosis proposes the addition of a very-low-risk group.
PV. Prognostic models for PV are summarized in Table 3.7. In addition to the risk factors included in these models, the clinical course of PV is also affected by the JAK2 V617F allele burden, which varies markedly between patients. In a prospective study of 338 patients, a JAK2 V617F allele burden of more than 50% was found to be an independent risk factor for progression to myelofibrosis. However, stratification by genetic risk is not currently widely used in clinical practice.
For both ET and PV, mutation status and other molecular markers are likely to become increasingly important in risk stratification. For example, in patients with ET, elevated JAK allele burden has been shown to predict survival, and may provide a surrogate marker of leukocytosis, while markers of bone marrow reticulin fibrosis have been reported to predict fibrotic progression in PV.
PMF. Three principal scoring systems are currently used for PMF (Table 3.8), all based on age, blood counts and the presence of constitutional symptoms:
the International Prognostic Scoring system (IPSS) is used to estimate survival at the time of diagnosis
the Dynamic IPSS (DIPSS) can be applied at any time during the course of the disease
the DIPPS-plus is a modified version of the DIPSS that incorporates three additional risk factors: unfavorable karyotype, low platelet count and need for transfusion.
Further versions of the IPSS have also been developed to incorporate genetic risk (the Mutation-Enhanced IPSS [MIPSS70]) and cytogenetic risk (MIPSS70-Plus).
As with ET and PV, it is likely that future risk stratification models in myelofibrosis will incorporate genetic and molecular markers in addition to the risk factors currently included in the IPSS and DIPPS. For example, the Myelofibrosis Secondary to PV and ET-Prognostic Model (MYSEC-PM) has recently been used to stratify risk in patients with secondary myelofibrosis (id est post-ET or -PV)., This model allocates points according to various molecular risk factors, and stratifies risk into four categories (Table 3.9).","<BULL> The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are based on abnormalities of peripheral blood counts and alterations in bone marrow morphology. <BULL> The diagnostic approach to essential thrombocythemia (ET) generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. <BULL> In contrast to ET, polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and in primary myelofibrosis (PMF). <BULL> The presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include symptomatic splenomegaly, anemia, constitutional symptoms (exempli gratia fatigue, pruritus), thrombosis and bleeding. <BULL> In addition to the risk of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life. <BULL> An individual patient's risk of vascular complications and disease progression depends on multiple clinical and molecular risk factors.

Risk stratification models have been developed for all three MPNs.","% reported being disabled. With the exception of spleen pain, each of these symptoms was significantly more common in patients with PV or PMF than in those with ET. [1]Constitutional symptoms in patients with MPNs have a number of causes, including:increased blood counts, increased platelet count, decreased platelet count, increased blood pressure, increased blood pressure and decreased blood pressure.increased platelet count and decreased blood pressure, which lead to fatigue and decreased physical activity (which may further worsen fatigue)increased platelet counts, decreased blood pressure, decreased blood pressure and increased blood pressure.dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, leading to an overall catabolic state characterized by night sweats, fevers and weight loss.increased blood pressure and increased platelet count.increased platelets and decreased blood pressureThe MPNs vary markedly in morphologic and clinical features (Table 3.1). Thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis are major diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV), respectively. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has a more variable presentation, which may include all the features of PV and ET; however, anemia is a common finding and work-up requires the differential diagnosis of anemia. Furthermore, PMF is generally associated with the most severe symptom burden among the MPNs, although patients with PV or ET often also have significant disease-related symptoms (see Table 3.1).Decreased platelet countDecreased blood pressureDecreased platelet countsDecreased blood pressureThe World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for MPNs (Tables 3.2 - 3.4) are based on peripheral blood counts, molecular abnormalities and alterations in bone marrow morphology, reflecting the central role of erythrocyte, venous or arterial thrombosis in the pathophysiology of these conditions.

TNM classification (IASLC, eighth edition)
As stage is one of the most important prognostic factors at diagnosis and is essential when making treatment decisions, it is important that it is as accurate as possible. At present, the extent of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) disease is staged according to the 2009 tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification (seventh edition). The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has proposed several changes to be implemented in the forthcoming eighth edition, which reflect global experience in the management of NSCLC.
Tumor size (T) is the primary descriptive and most significant prognostic factor for operable lung cancer. Table 3.1 shows the proposed changes to the current T classification. Subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare the survival benefit of sublobar resections (id est wedge resection or segmentectomy) and lobectomy (see pages 24 -). Surgical advances have enabled 'distance from the carina' to be removed from the new TNM classification. However, the poor prognosis associated with pleural invasion has been confirmed, and therefore it remains a contraindication to surgery.
Nodal status (N). A fundamental prerequisite in selecting patients for surgical treatment is reliable nodal staging (Table 3.2). The current N classification of nodal staging adequately predicts prognosis, so no change to the N descriptors has been recommended in the eighth edition. Division of the N1 stage into N1a (N1 at a single station) and N1b (N1 at multiple stations), and division of the N2 stage into N2a1 (N2 at a single station without N1 involvement; 'skip' metastasis), N2a2 (N2 at a single station with N1 involvement) and N2b (N2 at multiple stations) is descriptive only, as the survival curves for N1b and N2a2 overlap. Although N2a1 was associated with a better prognosis than N1b, the difference was not significant.
Metastasis (M). When patients were assessed according to the number of metastases, there were no significant differences in prognosis in patients with M1a staging (metastases within the chest cavity); however, patients with M1b tumors (distant metastases outside the chest cavity) with a single metastasis in a single organ had a significantly better prognosis than those with multiple metastases in one or several organs. This will now be the definition of M1b and will serve as a first step in providing rational selection criteria for surgical treatment of oligometastatic disease in clinical trials. There will also be a new M1c classification (Table 3.3) - multiple metastases in a single organ or in multiple organs.
Surgical resection of early-stage NSCLC
Surgery is the gold standard treatment for early-stage (I and II) lung cancer (Table 3.4).
Surgical procedures continue to evolve along a 'less is more' trajectory, with an increasing trend toward minimally invasive techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS] or robotics) and the removal of as little lung parenchyma as possible (lobectomy > segmentectomy > wedge resection; Figure 3.1).
Minimally invasive surgery versus open surgery. Minimally invasive procedures for early-stage NSCLC have become standard and an alternative to open surgery in centers with the appropriate experience. In a recent meta-analysis, patients who underwent VATS lobectomy had a significantly lower incidence of postoperative prolonged air leak, pneumonia, atrial arrhythmias and renal failure, and a shorter duration of hospital stay than those who had a thoracotomy. Furthermore, patients who underwent VATS had significantly higher adherence to adjuvant chemotherapy (earlier onset and higher completion rate) than those who underwent thoracotomy. However, there was no difference in oncologic results or lung function recovery during the late postoperative period.
Interest in robotic lung surgery for NSCLC is rising even though it has not demonstrated superiority over VATS with respect to the length of hospital stay. Further studies may help to determine the role of robotic surgery in NSCLC in the future.
Wedge resection versus segmentectomy versus lobectomy. The type of resection (see Figure 3.1) selected for the treatment of T1aN0M0 tumors depends on the patient's age, cardiopulmonary reserve, tumor size and histology.
A review of 45 prospective and retrospective studies conducted over the last 25 years showed that segmentectomies are superior to wedge resections in terms of local recurrences and cancer-related mortality rates. Whether the long-term results of lung-sparing segmentectomies and lobectomies are equivalent has yet to be determined. Lobectomies had better results than segmentectomies for tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter (T2bN0M0) in terms of disease-free and overall 5-year survival., In general, recent studies have failed to show any difference in survival outcomes between lobectomies, segmentectomies and wedge resections for small tumors less than 2 cm, although patients with invasive adenocarcinoma less than 2 cm may have improved survival outcomes after segmentectomy. The results of randomized clinical trials are awaited to determine if segmentectomies may be the preferred surgical treatment for the new classifications of T1a and T1b N0M0 tumors. Segmentectomies may also be considered in high-risk patients, or in the case of pure bronchoalveolar carcinomas for lung-sparing purposes.
Regardless of their extent, lung resections must comply with the principles of oncologic surgery in terms of disease-free margins and adequate systematic lymphadenectomy.
Ground glass opacity (GGO) is a pulmonary shadow visualized using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), comprised of hazy increased attenuation with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins. Adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of GGO, therefore careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy must be considered when GGO is identified.
Patients with multiple tumors and a prominent ground glass component on imaging or lepidic component on microscopy are being seen with increasing frequency. These tumors are associated with good survival after resection and have a lower propensity for nodal and extrathoracic spread than other types of NSCLC; however, they frequently relapse. Sublobar resection with the goal of sparing lung parenchyma is the gold standard for treatment of small GGO. The main difficulty is localizing the tumor within the lung during minimally invasive surgery. Different means of tracking the GGO and guiding the resection have been studied, including ink injection, coil insertion, and indocianide green injection.
Diffuse pneumonic-type involvement has a worse prognosis; it can lead to severe hypoxemia and end-stage respiratory distress. In this setting, a lobectomy is preferable to sublobar resection. In cases of bilateral pneumonic-type involvement with deep hypoxemia, lung transplantation has been studied in specifically selected patients with a high-risk of recurrence, with limited results.
For multifocal ground glass/lepidic tumors, the IASLC proposes that T staging should be defined by the largest T lesion, with either the number of tumors or 'm' in parentheses to denote the multifocal nature of the condition, and a single N and M category defining all the lesions collectively; for example, T1a(3)N0M0 or T1a(m)N0M0. For diffuse pneumonic-type lung cancer, T staging is designated by the tumor size if it is within one lobe, or as T4 if it involves an ipsilateral different lobe, or M1a if it is contralateral. A single N and M category is used for all pulmonary areas of involvement.
Surgical resection of locally advanced NSCLC
Most lung cancers are detected at an advanced stage and are treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgical resection has proved valuable in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC without nodal involvement or distant metastasis, resulting in long-term survival with a lower risk of postoperative mortality. Surgery also has a relevant role in the treatment of locally advanced tumors invading neighboring structures.
Patients with locally advanced NSCLC (T3 and T4 tumors) should be treated with multimodality therapy. Advances in perioperative management and postoperative care along with careful patient selection, are likely to make the operative mortality and morbidity less prohibitive. The prognosis after operations for T4 tumors mainly depends on the N stage and completeness of the resection. Patients with N0 or minimal N1 disease and complete resection do significantly better after radical resection than patients with N2 disease. The European and US guidelines for treatment of N2 disease are shown in Table 3.5.
Improvement of surgical techniques and anesthesiology has led to extended resection procedures such as carinal resections, chest wall resection with reconstruction, Pancoast tumor resections, vascular resections and reconstruction and spine resection, with low postoperative mortality and long-term survival of up to 50% at 5 years. In the present staging system, T4N0-1M0 lesions are categorized as stage IIIA disease (see Table 3.4), and T4 tumors without mediastinal nodal metastasis are now considered to be potentially curable if complete resection is possible.
For patients with resectable stage III NSCLC, the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear. Further clinical trials are needed to clarify the timing of surgery as part of multimodal treatment for resectable stage IIIA NSCLC.","<BULL> Better subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare wedge resection and segmentectomy. <BULL> New M1c staging for multiple metastases in one or several organs and the use of the term M1b for oligometastatic disease has the potential to provide rational selection criteria for clinical treatment trials. <BULL> Ground glass opacity (GGO) visualized on high-resolution computed tomography should trigger careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy. <BULL> Some locally advanced lung cancers benefit from multimodality therapy, which can include surgery.","Staging and surgery for metastatic NSCLC is the gold standard treatment for early-stage NSCLC (Table 3.4).Surgical resection is the gold standard for early-stage lung cancer.Surgical resections are the gold standard for surgical resection.Surgical resection of early stage NSCLC has been the gold standard for late-stage lung cancer ( Table 3.4).For patients with resectable stage III NSCLC, the optimal treatment strategy remains unclear.

9781910797426,ch12,"Unusual tumors of the pancreas and ampulla of Vater
A variety of tumors arise in close proximity to or within the pancreas that require special consideration and need to be differentiated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Table 12.1).
Ampullary, bile duct and duodenal tumors
Etiology and pathogenesis. Cancers of the ampulla of Vater, the intrapancreatic bile duct and duodenum are all adenocarcinomas and often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer. Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors. All of these tumors progress from a small benign adenoma through to invasive adenocarcinoma, although most are only detected at the cancerous stage. Ampullary tumors arise from the common channel of the ampulla of Vater as benign adenomas and progress as tubulovillous adenomas before becoming adenocarcinomas. Two pathological types of ampullary cancer have been described (intestinal versus pancreaticobiliary), with important consequences for patients' prognosis. Duodenal tumors also commence as adenomas before progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma. The long-term survival of patients with these cancers is better than that for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Figure 12.1).
Epidemiology and risk factors. Ampullary tumors are relatively common (around 1 per 100 000 in the general population), whereas bile duct cancer is much less common and duodenal cancer is rare.
The incidence of duodenal tumors is increased in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and also Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
Symptoms and signs. These tumors often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer, with obstructive jaundice and weight loss. Patients with an ampullary tumor may also present with intermittent jaundice or acute pancreatitis. Patients with duodenal cancer present with iron-deficiency anemia secondary to occult upper gastrointestinal blood loss.
Clinical presentation. All three tumor types may mimic pancreatic cancer and vice versa.
Pancreatic cancer may invade into or ulcerate the ampulla, giving the appearance of an ampullary cancer. Ampullary cancer will invade the duodenum and pancreatic parenchyma, mimicking pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic cancer may invade and ulcerate the duodenum, giving the appearance of a duodenal cancer. Invasion of the pancreas is typical of a duodenal cancer.
Bile duct cancer may invade the main pancreatic duct, giving rise to the classic double-duct sign of pancreatic cancer; the converse applies to 95% of pancreatic cancers arising in the head or uncinate process of the pancreas.
Imaging and biopsy. Ampullary and duodenal tumors may be visualized by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Brush cytology of the bile duct may also be undertaken for bile duct strictures using ERCP. Invasive adenocarcinomas usually arise deep within an ampullary tumor. For this reason, endoscopic sphincterotomy through the ampullary tumor needs to be performed and biopsies taken from deep within the tumor.
Treatment. Ampullary adenomas can be treated by local ampullectomy using a transduodenal approach or by endoscopic excision. Endoscopic snare papillectomy should be accompanied by pancreatic and bile duct stent placement in order to reduce procedure-related complications. A pancreas-preserving total duodenectomy can be used to treat dysplastic duodenal polyps or benign adenomas, especially in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.
For cancers of the ampulla, bile duct or duodenum, the treatment of choice is a Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy. The 5-year survival rates for completely resected tumors are about 50%, 30% and 25% for cancers of the ampulla, bile duct and duodenum, respectively. Unlike pancreatic cancer, long-term cure is possible in a large proportion of patients with these cancers (see Figure 12.1).
Ampullary tumors tend to be slow growing, so endoscopic stenting can provide good medium-to-long-term palliation in advanced patients. The role of chemoradiation or chemotherapy for these cancers in either the adjuvant or advanced setting is not established.
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
Etiology and pathogenesis. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) arise from cells in the islet of Langerhans or enterochromaffin-like cells. In contrast to most other tumors of the pancreas, these tumors tend to be highly vascular, a feature that is important in making a radiological diagnosis.
The tumors may be functioning (Table 12.2), with the ability to secrete peptides and neuroamines (some of which cause specific clinical syndromes), or they may be non-functioning. They may be sporadic in nature (non-inherited) or be part of an inherited neuroendocrine neoplasia syndrome.
Epidemiology and risk factors. The prevalence is around 2-4 per 100 000 in the general population. Nevertheless, this is a heterogeneous group of tumors and the incidence varies according to each specific pNET. Non-functional pNETs are the most frequent entity, being twice as frequent as insulinomas. Insulinomas have an incidence of 1-4 per 1 million people. These are followed by gastrinomas, glucagonomas, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide tumors (VIPomas), somatostatinomas, etc.
Several autosomal dominant diseases are associated with pNETs, including multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type-1, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, von Recklinghausen disease (neurofibromatosis 1) and, rarely, tuberous sclerosis. MEN type-1 is seen in less than 5% of patients with pNETs.
Symptoms and signs. Both functioning and non-functioning pNETs secrete various substances that do not determine specific hormonal syndromes, such as chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase, neurotensin, ghrelin and subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin. Patients with a suspected pNET require a full hormone screen, which should include chromogranin A and B levels, which are frequently elevated in non-functioning NETs. Specific hormone immunohistochemistry of a resected specimen will confirm the type of functioning NET and distinguish this from a non-functioning NET.
Insulinoma. The classic presentation is Whipple's triad:
signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia with neuroglycopenic changes (confusion, altered consciousness)
low blood glucose level at the time signs and symptoms occur
disappearance of the signs and symptoms when blood glucose levels are raised.
Typically, faintness, fatigue or even coma occurs with fasting (or vigorous exercise) and is relieved rapidly by eating a snack or drinking a liquid rich in glucose. The diagnosis is based on a very low blood sugar (< 2 mmol/L) and a high level of insulin and C-peptide (indicative of endogenous insulin). The main differential diagnosis is self-administration of insulin.
Gastrinoma causes very high gastric acid secretion, resulting in refractory multiple peptic ulcers, often of a severe nature (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and sometimes diarrhea. There is commonly a history of gastric or duodenal perforation or hemorrhage, necessitating emergency surgery on one or more occasion. The diagnosis is based on finding high serum gastrin levels (> 1000 pg/mL, or > 200 pg/mL after secretin stimulation) in a patient who is not acholhydric and is producing acid. Gastrin levels may also be elevated by histamine H2-receptor blockers, proton-pump inhibitors or Helicobacter pylori infection, but are rarely above 400 pg/ml in these situations.
Glucagonoma causes a characteristic necrolytic migratory erythema of the skin, often starting in the groin and perineum, and may also affect the oral mucosa. Other features may include attacks of hyperglycemia, stomatitis, vulvitis, anemia, rash, weight loss, diarrhea and psychiatric disturbances. High plasma glucagon levels are invariably found.
Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide tumor. A VIPoma causes watery diarrhea and hypokalemia (Verner-Morrison syndrome). This results in massive intestinal loss of sodium and bicarbonate, leading to hypovolemia, hypokalemia and achlorhydria or metabolic acidosis. There may be impaired glucose tolerance (VIP causes mild insulin resistance) and hypercalcemia. The diagnosis is clinched by high plasma levels of VIP.
Carcinoid tumors only cause symptoms if there are large-volume hepatic metastases. They are distinct clinical, histological and biological tumors secreting serotonin, demonstrated by the presence of high levels of its derivative (5-hidroxy indol acetic acid) in urine.
Somatostatinoma and pancreatic polypeptide tumor do not cause distinct clinical syndromes and should be distinguished from non-functioning NETs.
Non-functioning pNETs are usually large when diagnosed, frequently with liver metastases. Consequently, the symptoms are non-specific and include abdominal pain, weight loss and jaundice.
Localization of tumors. High vascularity and the presence of somatostatin receptors characterize pNETs. Most gastrinomas, but only half of insulinomas, have somatostatin receptors. These features are important in localizing tumors, which can often be very small. Localization is straightforward in 90% of cases but can be very difficult in the remainder, requiring a range of investigations (Figure 12.2), EUS (Figure 12.3) and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.
Imaging. Most pNETs are hypervascular on imaging, thus they are easily differentiated using contrast studies with transabdominal ultrasound, CT, MRI or angiography. Nevertheless, small tumors (insulinomas, gastrinomas, carcinoids) less than 10 mm in size are frequently missed by these imaging studies, being evident only on EUS combined with EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA), which has an accuracy exceeding 90% for intrapancreatic NETs. EUS is also helpful for patients with MEN type-1 or VHL syndrome.
Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is useful to localize various small pNETs, since they express somatostatin receptors which bind somatostatin analogs (octreotide, lanreotide). Radiolabeled somatostatin analogs such as 111In -diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide are therefore used to localize pNETs (octreotide scanning). The method can be combined with CT or single photon emission computed tomography, which allows the detection of the primary tumor as well as liver metastases. Positron emission tomography, for example with gallium-labeled somatostatin analogs, might be used more in the future.
Screening is usually based on MRI plus EUS and is indicated in patients with inherited pNETs (see page 138). It is used to identify pancreatic and extrapancreatic tumors in order to permit timely medical and surgical intervention.
Biopsy. The distinction between benign and malignant pNETs is difficult on histological grounds, but a high mitotic index is suggestive of malignancy. The risk of malignancy increases with tumor size (more than 2-3 cm). In principle, insulinomas tend to be benign, whereas all other pNETs have an increased propensity to malignancy.
A Ki-67 proliferative index may be performed in the biopsies of pNETs to assess aggressiveness, potential malignant behavior and to decide treatment.
Management. Patients with pNETs need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes specialist endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists and pancreatic surgeons.
Medical treatment. The syndromes associated with all of these tumors, except for insulinoma, can be managed medically during the wait for surgery or, if there is metastatic disease, with a long-acting somatostatin receptor antagonist (octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide slow release). Although antitumor efficacy of somatostatin analogs is rather weak, there is disease stabilization in more than 50% of patients. Surgical tumor debulking is commonly undertaken, since the symptoms may still be difficult to control with somatostatin receptor antagonists.
Proton-pump inhibitors will effectively reduce gastric acid secretion from gastrinomas but will not prevent tumor growth and metastases.
Radionuclide therapy. Metastatic tumors that can be imaged by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy can be treated by radionuclide tagged to the somatostatin analog. An alternative is the use of radiolabeled meta-iodobenzylguanide (MIBG), a catecholamine analog. Active amine precursor uptake-1 mechanisms that can internalize MIBG are expressed by pNETs, resulting in the incorporation of MIBG into cytoplasmic neurosecretory granules.
Surgery. In general, pNETs have a good prognosis, provided complete resection of the primary tumor, lymph node and even hepatic metastases is undertaken. Most small insulinomas and gastrinomas are benign but cannot be managed well by medical measures and require removal. They can be resected by simple enucleation, while larger tumors can be subjected to more extensive pancreatic resections, for example Whipple pancreatoduodenectomy.
Radical resection is required for pNETs other than insulinomas as they tend to be malignant. Malignancy in insulinoma is indicated by the presence of lymph-node metastases, and a formal pancreatic resection is therefore also required. Gastrinomas are often multiple and are commonly found in the duodenal wall. Surgical resection is the only procedure that will provide a cure with a normal life expectancy.
Non-functioning pNETs have an unpredictable prognosis, even with surgical resection. However, surgical resection should be undertaken, when it is possible.
Chemotherapy. The response of pNETs to chemotherapy is disappointing. However, chemotherapy may be useful for patients with poorly differentiated NETs with a high proliferation index. Advanced pNETs may benefit from different chemotherapy regimens, including temozolomide- or streptozocine-based therapies. Newer agents are available, such as mTOR inhibitors (everolimus), alone or in combination with somatostatin analogs (octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide slow release). Other antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib also have significant antitumor effects in pNETs.
Inherited pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
There are four known syndromes and all are inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. A patient with one of these syndromes requires genetic counseling and appropriate genetic testing.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 is caused by the MEN1 gene and is characterized by tumors in the parathyroid and enteropancreatic endocrine tissues, and the anterior pituitary (mainly prolactinomas). The typical age at diagnosis is 20-40 years, and penetrance is nearly 100% at 50 years of age. Multiple facial angiofibromas occur in 85% of patients. The spectrum of pancreatic islet tumors comprises:
gastrinomas in 25-67%
insulinomas in 10-34%
non-functioning tumors, including pancreatic polypeptide tumors (PPomas), in 10-50%
glucagonomas in 3-8%
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide tumors (VIPomas) in 1-5%
somatostatinomas in less than 1%.
The major feature is diffuse microadenomatosis, with a tumor diameter ranging from 300 μm to 5 mm, usually associated with one or more larger tumors. Patients with MEN-1 type-1 are at increased risk of premature death at a median age of 46-48 years.
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a rare disease caused by mutation in the VHL gene. Hypervascular neurological (central nervous hemangioblastomas and retinal angiomas), renal (clear cell carcinomas) and adrenal (pheochromocytomas) tumors are the commonly presenting lesions. Multiple pancreatic cysts are common and are invariably benign. In 12% of cases the pancreas may be the only organ affected.
The mean age at detection of pancreatic lesions is 38 years. Endolymphatic sac tumors and multiple pancreatic cysts, both of which are rare in the general population, suggest carrier status. The mean age at death without intervention is 41 years, with the most common cause of death being metastatic renal cell carcinoma or neurological complications from cerebellar hemangioblastomas.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is a common inherited autosomal dominant disorder. It affects about 1 in 3000-4000 live births and is caused by the NF-1 gene. In around 20% of patients the gastrointestinal tract is involved, with hyperplasia of submucosal or myenteric nerve plexuses, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, periampullary carcinoids, pheochromocytomas, periampullary paragangliomas, gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and, rarely, pNETs, most frequently duodenal somatostatinomas.
Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The major feature is the formation of hamartomas and neoplasms in multiple organs (brain, heart, kidney, skin) and, rarely, pNETs.
Other tumor types
Cystic pancreatic tumors. Cystic neoplasms need to be distinguished from pseudocysts secondary to acute or chronic pancreatitis. These tumors include serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and other rare cystic lesions (cystic neuroendocrine tumors, etc.). Diagnosis is made by CT (Figure 12.4) or MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography sequences (Figure 12.5), usually followed by EUS-guided FNA and analysis of the cystic fluid (Figure 12.6).
Serous cystadenomas are almost invariably benign, usually occur in women and are often left-sided. These tumors are harmless and may be observed serially using CT or EUS.
Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas by definition contain mucin. Mucinous cystadenomas are premalignant and, along with cystadenocarcinomas, warrant radical excision.
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are being increasingly recognized. Pathognomonic features include an irregularly dilated main pancreatic duct containing thick mucus that is readily observed being extruded from the ampulla on endoscopy and/or one or more pancreatic cysts. The cysts develop either from the main pancreatic duct or from side branches. Intraductal papillary neoplasms with main pancreatic duct cysts are more likely to be malignant or progress to malignancy than neoplasms with side-branch cysts. Partial radical resection or total pancreatectomy is necessary in appropriate patients.
Multiple benign cysts may be a feature of polycystic kidney or renal syndrome, part of the VHL syndrome, or may indicate carrier status of the VHL gene.
Other malignant cystic lesions. A variety of pancreatic malignancies may contain cystic elements, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors.
Pancreatic lymphoma. By definition pancreatic lymphoma is restricted to the pancreas and draining lymph nodes. Resection should be undertaken where possible. If this is not feasible chemotherapy should be tried, although pancreatic lymphomas respond poorly.
Metastases to the pancreas. The pancreas is a site for the spread of metastases from cancers originating in the abdomen, breast, bronchus or skin (melanoma). Sometimes these metastases are isolated, in which case radical resection is the treatment of choice.
Future trends
Improved preoperative classification to permit more accurate decision making regarding clinical management.
Molecular profiling to enable accurate distinction between tumor types.

Although half of all primary and metastatic brain tumors occur in patients over the age of 65 (Figure 12.1), geriatric neuro-oncology is an area that has received limited attention. Population studies suggest that increasing age is often associated with decreasing treatment. While this may be appropriate for some elderly patients, other patients over the age of 65 remain in excellent health with a good quality of life and the potential to respond to appropriate treatment. The area deserves particular attention as the elderly represent the fastest growing segment of the population.
Many intracranial tumors present with subacute cognitive decline over several weeks to months. In an elderly patient the differential diagnosis for this clinical presentation is lengthy, ranging from dementia and depression to cerebrovascular disease. Employing excellent neuroimaging early in the diagnostic evaluation usually allows diagnosis of an intracranial mass lesion. As each tumor requires a specific approach to management it is critical to obtain tissue for a pathological diagnosis to avoid administering incorrect and toxic therapies.
Recent advances in the management of brain tumors raise a number of issues for older patients. First, older patients are often underrepresented in those clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of a new therapy and thus it is not known if the same benefit can be expected in the geriatric population. Further, the acute toxicity profile associated with a new therapy may be different in the elderly. Finally, the assessment of long-term toxicity associated with new therapies is often limited at the time of initial development and may present differently in older patients.
Patient assessment
Several specific issues arise in the assessment of older brain tumor patients (Table 12.1). Communication is critical as memory declines with age and neurological symptoms may further impair language and memory. Technical and medical terminology may not be easily comprehended or retained. It's also crucial to define the goals of care (exempli gratia extending survival or minimizing symptoms and side effects) and to involve family members when decisions are being made.
The likelihood of having multiple chronic medical conditions increases with age. Approximately 80% of persons over 65 years old have at least one chronic medical condition and 65% have several. The most common medical conditions among older people are hypertension, heart failure, vision problems, endocrine or metabolic conditions, dementia, atrial fibrillation, anemia and musculoskeletal diseases. A related concern is polypharmacy. The number of patients taking multiple (five or more) medications is highest among those aged 65 and older. Nutritional status is often poor in the elderly and may merit assessment. Social considerations such as marital status, income and housing are equally important and have been shown to influence treatment decisions in older cancer patients.
Glioblastoma occurs most often in people 65-84 years of age. Several studies have shown that the likelihood of receiving surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy decreases with age; however, older patients with glioblastoma can benefit from combination therapy.
Surgical resection of glioblastoma may extend survival and improve quality of life in older patients who are in good health. Improvements in neurosurgical techniques (neuronavigation, awake surgery and intraoperative MRI) and anesthesia options allow for more aggressive intervention among older patients with comorbid conditions.
Radiotherapy extends survival over best supportive care in older patients with glioblastoma. This benefit is greatest when used in conjunction with debulking surgery. It may be reasonable to use a modified radiotherapy regimen in some older patients. Several studies suggest that a shortened course of radiotherapy delivered over 2-3 weeks has efficacy similar to that of the standard 6-week regimen and this may have practical benefits for some patients.
Chemotherapy. Temozolomide is currently approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma and is started during radiotherapy. The trial leading to approval of temozolomide excluded patients over the age of 70. However, several studies have now shown that temozolomide is effective in older patients both in terms of tumor response and extended survival. However, there may be an increase in acute toxicity in older patients. Also, older patients receiving temozolomide during radiotherapy may have treatment-induced neurological decline.
Bevacizumab was recently approved in the USA for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. Several studies suggest that this drug may be particularly effective in older glioblastoma patients and merits further study.
Primary central nervous system lymphoma
The current recommended standard of care for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimen followed by consolidative whole-body radiotherapy in select patients (see Chapter 10).
However, in the elderly patient, concern is often raised about the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate. Delayed neurotoxicity has been described as a consequence of whole-body radiotherapy following high-dose methotrexate, particularly in older patients, which raises a concern about appropriate use in the elderly.
The major limiting toxicity of high-dose methotrexate is renal toxicity. Assessment of renal function using creatinine clearance is a standard recommendation in geriatric oncology to guide chemotherapy dosing. Therefore, the best recommendation is to assess renal function using creatinine clearance (> 50 mL/h) to determine and modify the recommended methotrexate dose (> 3 g/m) in PCNSL. Several studies have specifically looked at delivering high-dose methotrexate to elderly patients with PCNSL (Table 12.2). Radiographic response rates of 90% or higher have been described and one study showed no difference in acute toxicity associated with methotrexate in older patients.
Elderly patients with PCNSL treated with whole-body radiotherapy as consolidation following methotrexate have a significant risk of delayed neurotoxicity - estimated to be as high as 90%. This syndrome is characterized by progressive cognitive decline that begins within months of completing whole-body radiotherapy. Associated symptoms include gait decline and urinary incontinence. Most patients require assistance with activities of daily living and have a poor quality of life. There is no effective therapy for this syndrome.
Recognition of the safety and effectiveness of high-dose methotrexate and treatment-related neurotoxicity has led to the recommendation that whole-body radiotherapy should be avoided for elderly patients, and that methotrexate-based chemotherapy alone should be used as standard treatment.
Other tumors
Results from specific studies of the elderly are not available to guide treatment for most other brain tumors. However, it is reasonable to follow the general guidelines outlined for geriatric oncology to determine the best approach. Older patients who are healthy with limited comorbidities and full function should be offered the standard of care. Those patients with moderate comorbidities and/or limited independence should be considered for standard treatment with possible modifications to limit side effects. Those elderly patients who are truly frail (multiple comorbidities, complete dependence or a severe geriatric syndrome such as dementia) are most appropriately offered best supportive care.",<BULL> Pathological diagnosis is critical to select appropriate therapy. <BULL> Aggressive therapy may improve outcome in elderly patients. <BULL> It may or may not be necessary to modify specific therapies for the elderly because of the risk of toxicity. <BULL> Neurocognitive outcome is of particular concern in elderly patients with brain tumors. <BULL> Clinical trials are needed to address issues specific to elderly patients with brain tumors.,"Geriatric neuro-oncology is an area that has received limited attention.Although half of all primary and metastatic brain tumors occur in patients over the age of 65 (Figure 12.1). Assessment of renal function using creatinine clearance is a standard recommendation in geriatric oncology to guide chemotherapy dosing. Therefore, the best recommendation is to assess renal function using creatine phosphodiesterase (CPP) to determine and modify the recommended methotrexate dose. This may be appropriate for older patients with PCNSL (Table 12.1). However, other patients with CPP are most likely to benefit from this treatment. However, other patients are more likely to benefit from the treatment. Patients with CPP may benefit from this treatment as well. Patients with PCNSL may benefit from the treatment of CPP as well as from the treatment of other brain tumors (Table 12.2).Many intracranial tumors present with subacute cognitive decline over several weeks to months.

The expanded genetic characterization of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis is a critical advance in the last 5 years and is influencing both treatment and patient selection for standard therapy and clinical trials in AML. While the karyotype remains key in prognostication, molecular profiling represents a paradigm shift for both research and the clinical management of AML. Molecular testing is destined to become an essential part of the initial characterization of patients with AML.
Drugs in late-stage development
As described in Chapter 3, four new treatments for AML were recently approved, three of which are molecularly targeted products, marking a turning point in the treatment of AML. Several targeted agents are currently in the late stages of clinical development, as described below, and many more approaches are being explored (see Table 6.1). Many of these products in development have been awarded breakthrough status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recognizing the lack of effective treatments for patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and those with relapsed or refractory disease, for whom the prognosis is poor.
FLT3 inhibitors. In addition to midostaurin, several other FLT3 inhibitors are currently in trials.
Crenolanib inhibits FLT3 internal tandem repeat (FLT3 -ITD) and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3 -TKD) mutations in the active conformation but has little activity against cKIT; this is expected to avoid the myelosuppression seen with other FLT3 inhibitors that have been shown to inhibit KIT. The addition of crenolanib to standard 3 + 7 induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML resulted in 88% complete response rate (CR), with no unexpected toxicities.
Quizartinib (AC220). A non-randomized Phase II study reported a remission rate of 44% and median overall survival (OS) of 23 weeks in patients with FLT3 -ITD-mutated AML that had relapsed or was refractory to second-line treatment or relapsed following HCT in a non-randomized Phase II study. Quizartinib is being investigated across multiple lines of treatment, including induction and consolidation chemotherapy, as a maintenance therapy for patients in first remission after chemotherapy, and for salvage therapy.
Gilteritinib is also being evaluated across multiple lines of treatment in patients with FLT3-positive AML, including for maintenance treatment following chemotherapy or HCT, first-line treatment, and in comparison with salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed disease. Gilteritinib is thought to be more potent than midostaurin, as it also targets the kinase AXL, which is thought to contribute to the resistance seen with other FLT3 inhibitors.
Sorafenib (which is already used to treat renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma) has shown promising results in various lines of treatment. A Phase II single-arm study in which sorafenib was added to standard induction/consolidation and continued as maintenance in elderly patients (> 60 years) with FLT3 -ITD or FLT3 -TKD mutations reported CR or CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) in 69% of patients and 1-year OS of 62% (FLT3 -ITD) and 71% (FLT3 -TKD) at a median follow-up of 28.3 months. Median OS was 12.5 and 9.0 months, respectively, and disease-free survival was 15.0 and 16.2 months, respectively. Sorafenib has also been explored as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed FLT3 -mutated AML, before or after transplant, with profound and sustained remissions being observed in some patients.
Hypomethylating agents in development include guadecitabine and oral azacitidine. Decitabine and subcutaneous azacitidine are already used for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. Guadecitabine is a dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine, which protects decitabine from degradation in the intracellular compartment. Phase II studies have reported increases in response rates compared with historical data, and promising median OS in responders. Oral azacitidine is currently being evaluated as maintenance therapy for patients with AML who are not eligible for HCT, and as maintenance therapy in the post-transplant setting for patients with advanced myeloid malignancies.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors. Pracinostat is an oral histone deacetylase inhibitor that is being evaluated in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in older patients (>= 75 years) who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy (because of age or comorbidities). A Phase II study in this population showed a median OS of 19.1 months and a CR rate of 42% (21 of 50 patients), compared with OS of 10.4 months and CR of 19.5 with for azacitidine alone in a Phase III study.
The bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax is already licensed for use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is now being evaluated in AML. Activity was limited as monotherapy in AML but much better response rates were seen in combination with hypomethylating agents (decitabine or azactidine) in older patients (>= 65 years) who were not eligible for induction chemotherapy: 70-75% of patients achieved CR or CRi. Venetoclax is also being evaluated in combination with low-dose cytarabine in a non-randomized open-label Phase I/II study in elderly patients (>= 65 years) with treatment-naïve AML who not eligible for intensive chemotherapy.
E-selectin inhibitors. GMI-1271 is a novel antagonist of E-selectin, an adhesion molecule expressed in AML cells that has been shown to enhance responses to chemotherapy. A Phase II study of GMI-1271 in combination with cytarabine plus mitoxantrone and etoposide in patients (aged > 60 years) reported a CR/CRi rate of 75% in those with treatment-naïve AML and 67% in those with secondary AML.
Novel immunotherapies
The FDA has recently approved two novel immunologic therapies for malignancies of B-lymphocytes: chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell products that target CD19 (by Novartis for acute lymphoblastic leukemia; by KITE for non-Hodgkin lymphoma). In both cases, autologous B-cells are collected from the patient by apheresis, genetically engineered to target CD19, then infused back into the patient. High response rates and durable remissions have been reported in patients with highly refractory disease. Whether the method of CAR targeting can be successfully applied to other hematologic cancers such as AML remains to be seen. Clearly, there are unique features of the target in B-lymphocytes (CD19; in particular, its lack of expression in other tissues beyond B-cells). A number of other CAR immune cells targeting other molecules are in development, including in AML.
The challenges in drug development in this area are highlighted by recent reports from Cellectis on its 'off the shelf' CD123-CAR T-cell trial for AML and the related disorder of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). CD123 is highly expressed in BPDCN and in early myeloid cells. Treatment of two patients with the CD123-CAR T-cell product (UCART123) resulted in cytokine release syndrome and one death.
Nevertheless, studies of cellular therapies, including CAR-T and natural killer (NK) cells, and antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 and other markers, are of interest. New approaches to treatment include antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and novel antibody-based approaches using bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) and dual-affinity re-targeting (DART) molecules, which bind to CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts, thereby directing activated immune cells to malignant cells. Studies with cellular therapies and other antibody-based therapies are of great interest and promise in AML, including with CAR-T or NK cells, and likewise with antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 or other markers of interest. Included among these are new ADCs and novel antibody-based approaches using BiTEs or DARTs designed to direct activated immune cells to malignant cells (id est dual affinity for CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts).
A new era for clinical trials in AML?
Recent experience with enasidenib, approved on the basis of data from patients specifically with IDH2 mutations, challenges the dogma that large randomized controlled trials showing survival benefit in a general AML population are required for approval. The approval of enasidenib was based on data from a single-arm phase 1/2 monotherapy trial involving only 199 patients; historical data were used for the control. This approval reflects the regulatory agencies' recognition of the challenges of evaluating new treatments in relatively rare subtypes of a disease; similar approvals have been seen across a range of oncology (hematologic and solid tumors) in recent years. Trials of new targeted agents are also likely to be in small, clearly identified patient populations.
Beat AML is a new approach to clinical trials, begun in late 2016 and sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The aim is to quickly and comprehensively genetically characterize older patients (> 60 years) with previously untreated AML and to treat with novel targeted therapy on the basis of the genetic result. Within a week of diagnosis, patients will be assigned to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations (Table 6.2). Each group is treated with unique therapy designed for that molecular aberration. Patients who have more favorable clinical outcomes with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with core binding factor rearrangements or an NPM1 mutation without an FLT3 mutation) are assigned 3 + 7-based treatment in combination with an investigational agent. Patients with poor long-term outcomes and lower remission rates with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with a p53 mutation) receive less intensive therapy. Two examples of treatments in these poor-risk subsets are hypomethylating agent in combination with novel therapy, and monotherapy with an investigational agent followed by lower-intensity treatment (if no response is observed during the monotherapy window). Hopefully, such an approach will quickly identify promising agents and speed up drug approvals in AML. Subsequent iterations of the trial (exempli gratia 'version 2.0' and beyond) will include agents for other targets and possibly combinations of novel drugs.
Of critical importance to the Beat AML trial, as well as for trials of treatments, is the need to achieve disease control in order to facilitate the opportunity for alloHCT for eligible patients. Even in the era of molecular targeted treatment, alloHCT remains the best tool available for the prevention of relapse.","<BULL> A wide range of targeted agencies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently in the late stages of development, including FLT3 inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, giltertinib, sorafenib), hypomethylating agents (guadecitabine, oral azacitidine), the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat, the blc-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the E-selectin inhibitor GM-1271. <BULL> Immunologic therapies, antibody-drug conjugates and antibody-based approaches are also being explored in AML. <BULL> The approval of enasidenib based on single-arm Phase I/II data is challenging the dogma that large randomized controlled trials in a general AML population are required.

The pathophysiology of acne centers on the interplay of four main factors (Figure 2.1):
increased sebum production
follicular hyperkeratinization
the action of Propionibacterium acnes within the follicle and dermis
Increased sebum production. Acne is a hormonally mediated disease, with androgens contributing to an increase in sebum production from sebaceous glands. Increased sebum production, which presents as seborrhea, correlates well with acne severity.
Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is thought to be the main androgen responsible for sebum production, although a possible direct role of testosterone has not been excluded. However, only a minority of patients with acne have elevated serum androgen levels, and irregular menses or hirsutism has been reported only infrequently in women with acne.
Follicular hyperkeratinization involves increased keratinocyte proliferation and decreased desquamation of the cells lining the orifice of sebaceous follicles of the face, scalp, chest or back, resulting in sebum- and keratin-filled microcomedones. A microcomedone is not clinically visible but can be identified by surface follicular biopsy using cyanoacrylate glue applied to a glass microscope slide.
As hyperkeratinization progresses, a microcomedone develops into either an open comedone (blackhead) or a closed comedone (whitehead). It takes approximately 8 weeks for a microcomedone to develop into a visible acne lesion. This is one reason why the full effect of acne medications is not achieved until therapy has been administered for several weeks.
This process of follicular hyperkeratinization and possibly an increase in cell division and cohesiveness of the cells lining the follicular lumen, producing comedones, has been referred to as 'follicular plugging', although complete occlusion of the follicular lumen does not occur; sebum still flows from follicles affected with acne. The cause of follicular hyperkeratinization is not known but may relate to a local deficiency of linoleic acid or production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 within the follicle.
Colonization with Propionibacterium acnes. Once sebum production begins at adrenarche, sebaceous follicles become colonized with the commensal bacterium P. acnes. This bacterium utilizes sebaceous lipids as a nutrient source and hydrolyzes the triglycerides found in sebum into free fatty acids and glycerol. The free fatty acids are an irritant to the follicular wall and can lead to rupture of the follicle, with subsequent release of keratin-rich corneocytes and sebum into the dermis. This process intensifies the inflammation associated with acne (see below).
P. acnes is also a potent activator of the innate immune response in acne via its activation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and the inflammasome (a multiprotein cytoplasmic complex), each of which leads to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines within affected skin.
Recent evidence suggests that P. acnes may form a biofilm within follicles that may make them less susceptible to treatment with antibiotics and oxidizing agents.
Inflammation. Inflammatory lesions are thought to develop from comedones following the influx of inflammatory cells and/or rupture of the follicular wall. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of inflammatory responses even in the very earliest phases of acne lesion development. Inflammatory mediators stimulate vasodilatation and neutrophil chemotaxis into the pores, which may result in papules and pustules. Papules and pustules may evolve into tender inflammatory nodules or 'cysts' as the extent of the inflammation increases. Inflammatory acne may produce scarring. Atrophic scars (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) are caused by a loss of tissue, while hypertrophic or fibrotic scars (Figure 2.4) are due to an increase in tissue.
Modifying factors
Myths still remain about factors that might influence the disease and the appropriate facts should be shared with the patient. For example, acne is frequently worse before the menstrual period. Stress may worsen acne; in turn, acne certainly and frequently causes more stress.
The role of diet in acne is controversial. Factors that have been implicated include 'glycemic load', the intake of dairy products, skim milk, chocolate and whey, obesity, reduced intake of fish, lack of omega-3 fatty acids and others. Epidemiological studies suggest a possible link with intake of skim milk, while clinical trials in very small numbers of patients suggest that a diet with a low glycemic index may be beneficial in patients with acne, as summarized in recent systematic reviews on this topic.
Questions that patients frequently ask are summarized in Table 8.1, pages 83-4.","<BULL> Acne is a hormonally mediated disease. <BULL> Four main factors are implicated in the etiology of acne:- high sebum production- hyperkeratinization of the intrafollicular duct- colonization by Propionibacterium acnes- inflammation. <BULL> There are many myths about the factors that influence acne; patients should be made aware of the appropriate facts (see Table 8.1, pages 83-4 ).","Pathophysiology, etiology and modifying factors of acne.The pathophysiology of acne centers on the interplay of four main factors (Figure 2.1):increased sebum production,increased keratinocyte proliferation and decreased desquamation of the cells lining the orifice of sebaceous follicles of the face, scalp, chest or back.increased keratinocytes and decreased keratinocyte proliferation.follicular hyperkeratinization and increased keratinocyte proliferation (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) are caused by the action of Propionibacterium acnes within the follicle and dermis.Increased sebum production.

9781910797471,ch05,"Case history
A 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and renal impairment is referred to the cardiology outpatient department because of fatigue. He is overweight and relatively inactive, but still able to visit his country property and went hunting as recently as last year. He has experienced shortness of breath when climbing two flights of stairs at home and has difficulty in walking uphill to his house. He has no history of ischemic heart disease or other cardiac symptoms. His blood pressure is 164/96 mmHg and he has an irregular pulse of 102 beats per minute. He has no jugular venous distension or edema, and his chest is clear to auscultation; the apex beat is impalpable but there is a blowing pansystolic murmur at the apex. The chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and the ECG shows atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block.
This is a typical presentation of decompensating chronic heart failure (HF). The following questions need to be asked:
Is this really HF?
What was the functional status before this deterioration?
What is the ejection fraction?
What is the underlying etiology?
What is the precipitant of this exacerbation?
Is there coronary artery disease?
What social support is in place that will support care at home?
Are there features that may eventually require device therapy (implantable cardiac defibrillator [ICD] or cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT])?
Table 5.1 provides an overview of the factors that contribute to acute presentations.
Symptoms and signs
The onset of HF symptoms (Table 5.2) may be acute (typically with pulmonary edema, even with cardiogenic shock) or subacute. Both right and left HF may occur in the context of low output (fatigue, syncope and hypotension), and both right- and left-sided HF usually occur together. Assessment of functional class (see Table 2.1), based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic HF because it is linked to outcome - the annualized mortality in NYHA class IV HF is about 50%, which is four to five times that of class II and twice that of class III.
The signs of HF are often subtle. Jugular venous pressure is a sign of intravascular volume overload that is often overlooked (25-58% of cases) (Table 5.3).
The Framingham criteria for HF are shown in Table 5.4. However, these features are ill-suited to the recognition of HF with preserved ejection fraction, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has proposed the incorporation of imaging findings in order to facilitate the recognition of HF in patients presenting with exercise intolerance alone (see Table 5.4).
Acute heart failure
The initial clinical picture of acute HF reflects the varying degree of impairment of cardiac output and elevation in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (obtained at left and right heart catheterization, respectively).
Patients with acute HF can present with one of several distinct hemodynamic profiles, based on the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold) (Figure 5.3).
More specific for acute HF is Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention.
Arrhythmias may play a part in both acute and chronic HF. Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement. Atrial arrhythmias contribute to reduced functional capacity, as atrial systole makes an important contribution to stroke volume, especially in the context of LV filling problems and particularly with exercise. Although some patients die from progressive HF, ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF. The risk of fatal arrhythmias is greatest in the presence of low ejection fraction, but because of the higher number of patients with less severe reduction of ejection fraction, this group has the highest absolute number of sudden deaths.
Blood tests. In most patients, routine biochemistry includes blood tests for electrolytes and renal and liver function, a full blood count (to assess anemia) and evaluation of C-reactive protein levels if infection is suspected. Thyroid function tests and iron studies should be obtained at initial presentation in patients with cardiomyopathies. Type B natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels need only be assessed in the acute setting when echocardiography is not available and the diagnosis is in doubt. In such circumstances, levels of BNP lower than 100 pg/mL and NT-proBNP lower than 300 pg/mL would make the diagnosis of HF in patients with acute dyspnea highly unlikely (beware of patients with flash pulmonary edema or right ventricular [RV] dysfunction where the levels may be low).
Use of natriuretic peptide concentration in the diagnosis of HF in the non-acute setting is a novel indication and will require further validation (Figure 5.4). The proposed cut-off levels are low (NTproBNP > 125 pg/mL, BNP > 35 pg/mL). Understanding the factors that influence peptide levels (renal function, atrial fibrillation, obesity) is crucial in order to ensure its appropriate clinical application.
Electrocardiography will help to identify atrial fibrillation, evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or LV hypertrophy (LVH) and conduction delay or abnormalities (exempli gratia QT c interval).
Chest X-rays can be used to identify pulmonary congestion or chamber enlargement.
Echocardiography. An echocardiogram is appropriate at original diagnosis or if the patient deteriorates. The main goals of echocardiography are to assess LV size, systolic and diastolic LV function, disturbances of regional function (which suggest an ischemic heart disease etiology), valve regurgitation and LVH. Patients with HF who undergo echocardiography have significantly better outcomes than those who do not - presumably because of the initiation of appropriate therapy.
The introduction of 3D echocardiography has significantly improved the quantification of LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) over the 2D method. The assessment of myocardial deformation with strain has helped in early detection of myocardial dysfunction (cardiotoxicity) and disease-specific patterns of myocardial involvement (exempli gratia apical sparing in cardiac amyloidosis).
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). There are three major indications for CMR in HF:
to supplement poor quality echocardiographic images (often due to obesity or chronic lung disease)
to obtain accurate measurements when the echo results are ambiguous (exempli gratia EF < 35% has specific implications for device therapy)
to assess myocardial scar burden.
The last is used to detect and quantify transmural scarring in CAD (see assessment of viability, below) and to identify scarring in non-coronary heart disease.
CMR has greater capability for tissue characterization than echocardiography, and may be used to identify specific etiologies for HF, some of which have clear prognostic or therapeutic implications (exempli gratia amyloidosis, sarcoidosis), while others are less certain (exempli gratia myocarditis). The use of CMR in HF is extremely variable between centers.
Imaging for coronary disease and viable myocardium. The role of CAD should be considered in any patient with HF. Coronary investigation is often not indicated in young patients for whom there is a good alternative explanation for their symptoms; however, most patients with HF are elderly and in these patients coronary angiography may be considered if it is felt that the patient is a suitable candidate for a revascularization procedure. Coronary CT has been used in these circumstances, although calcification, which may preclude recognition of stenosis, should be expected in older patients.
Once coronary disease has been identified, the next question is whether this is an 'innocent bystander'. A variety of tests have been reported for the detection of viable myocardium, ranging from the simple (single-photon-emission CT, dobutamine echo) to the complex (MRI, positron emission tomography). Although the STICH trial found no relationship between the results of viability imaging and outcome, it is important to consider not only the presence of dysfunctional but viable tissue, but also its extent, id est the total burden of compromised myocardium, including ischemia.
Functional testing involves exercise testing using either a treadmill or ergometer, with or without analysis of expired gases to obtain peak oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide generation. Functional testing is of value for objective quantification of exercise capacity at any stage, but especially in patients who are being evaluated for advanced therapies, including devices and transplantation.","<BULL> Assessment of functional class, based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic heart failure (HF) as it is linked to outcome. <BULL> Also key to the diagnosis of HF is the assessment of ejection fraction, underlying etiology and precipitating factors, and the role of coronary artery disease. <BULL> The hemodynamic profile of acute HF varies according to the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold). <BULL> Atrial arrhythmias contribute to a reduction in functional capacity, while ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF. <BULL> Investigations in patients with HF include blood tests, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and other imaging techniques. <BULL> Functional testing is of particular value in patients deemed suitable candidates for devices or transplantation.","Case history of cardiac arrhythmias and pulmonary edemaA 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and renal impairment is referred to the cardiology outpatient department because of fatigue. He is overweight and relatively inactive, but still able to visit his country property and went hunting as recently as last year. He has experienced shortness of breath when climbing two flights of stairs at home and has difficulty in walking uphill to his house. He has no history of ischemic heart disease or other cardiac symptoms. His blood pressure is 164/96 mmHg and he has an irregular pulse of 102 beats per minute. He has no jugular venous distension or edema, and his chest is clear to auscultation; the apex beat is impalpable but there is a blowing pansystolic murmur at the apex. The chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and the ECG shows atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block. This is a typical presentation of decompensating chronic heart failure (HF).

9781910797105,ch08,"Neurochemical abnormalities, including changes to the activity of neurotransmitters, are the link between underlying causal factors, either genetic or environmental, and the signs and symptoms of the illness. Over the last 50 years, multiple neurotransmitter systems have been hypothesized to be involved in the neurochemistry of schizophrenia. These hypotheses have fallen in and out of vogue as our knowledge of the brain and our methods for investigating brain neurobiology have become more sophisticated. The major neurochemical pathophysiological hypotheses continue to involve the traditional neurotransmitters, although this situation is changing as novel molecular biological techniques are applied to the study of schizophrenia.
The dopamine hypothesis
Dopamine cell bodies exist in two areas: the hypothalamus and the midbrain. In the hypothalamus, dopamine controls pituitary prolactin release (tuberohypophyseal pathway). The midbrain is the source of three pathways: one from the substantia nigra to the dorsal striatum in the basal ganglia (nigrostriatal pathway), and two others projecting from the ventral tegmental area to the ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway) and to the frontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) (Figure 8.1).
In the early 1960s, the Swedish pharmacologist Arvid Carlsson (Figure 8.2) posited the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, in which he stated that schizophrenia was caused by an excess of dopaminergic activity, either an excess of dopamine release and/or hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors. The hypothesis was built on three observations. First was the recognition of a schizophrenia-like psychosis in people who misused amphetamine, a drug known to increase the release of dopamine. Second was the emergence of adverse effects of the recently discovered antipsychotic chlorpromazine, which mimicked Parkinson's disease, itself thought to be due to faulty dopamine transmission. Third was the observation that all effective antipsychotic agents were dopamine receptor antagonists. In the following 15 years, while several experiments provided compelling, but circumstantial, evidence in further support of the importance of the dopamine D receptor in schizophrenia, there remained known shortcomings in the dopamine hypothesis and a lack of direct evidence. In addition, the prediction that untreated patients should have increased numbers of dopamine receptors received no firm support from postmortem assays nor, more critically, from studies using positron emission tomography (PET), which imaged the binding of radiolabeled antipsychotic drugs to receptors.
Four developments have helped to revive the dopamine hypothesis. First, the hypothesis was reformulated to predict the existence of both hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic activity in people with schizophrenia. The reformulation states that positive symptoms are due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, whereas negative symptoms are due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway (see Figure 8.1).
Second, in the late 1980s, new biomolecular techniques found five dopamine receptor subtypes, which differ functionally and in their pattern of target neuron/brain region distribution (Table 8.1). D receptors are the most common and are always postsynaptic. D is related to the D -like family. The D family includes D, D and D. D receptors are located both presynaptically on dopamine terminals, where they act as autoreceptors regulating dopamine release, and postsynaptically. The development of more specific receptor ligands may lead to new information on the location and role of the different dopamine receptors.
Third, more informative functional imaging approaches can now assess dopamine activity in vivo. After infusion of an indirect dopamine agonist, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or PET demonstrates the extent to which radioligand occupancy of postsynaptic dopamine receptors is reduced by competition with increased endogenous dopamine. The comparison of pre- and post-infusion radioligand occupancy provides an index of dopamine release and reuptake rates. Studies using this approach have shown increased dopamine release following a bolus of a dopamine-releasing agent such as methylphenidate in drug-free patients with schizophrenia compared with controls, providing the first direct evidence for the dopamine hypothesis (Figure 8.3). The extent of dopamine release correlates with the severity of positive psychotic symptoms and also predicts how well a patient will respond to antipsychotic drug treatment.
Another approach has examined the effects of antipsychotic drugs on dopamine D receptor occupancy. Studies have shown a strong association between dopamine D receptor occupancy, antipsychotic dose, symptom remission and adverse effects.
Finally, multiple studies have demonstrated that dopamine plays a central role in reward mechanisms, especially the mesolimbic projection to the nucleus accumbens. People with schizophrenia exhibit several impairments that are consistent with altered reward system function, including anhedonia, decreased motivation and failure to use feedback to enhance goal-directed behavior.
The role of glutamate
Although the dopamine hypothesis remains central, it has been found that a substantial proportion of people with schizophrenia do not adequately respond to dopamine antagonists. This suggests that other neurotransmitters are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
The glutamate hypothesis. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and plays a central role in cortical-subcortical and thalamic-cortical excitatory projections. It acts at ionotropic receptors, which mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and at metabotropic receptors, which activate second messenger systems through the G-protein system and regulate the release of glutamate and other neurotransmitters (Table 8.2).
The N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor and other ionotropic receptors have been most extensively studied in schizophrenia. Abnormalities in NMDA receptor function have been hypothesized to disrupt glutamatergic system function in people with schizophrenia. Indirect evidence supports this hypothesis. Phencyclidine (PCP), when used as a street drug, can cause a psychosis that, unlike amphetamine psychosis, appears also to include negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. PCP exerts its effect through blocking the ion channel gated by the NMDA receptor, which would initially produce a hypoglutamatergic state. However, the PCP-induced decrease in NMDA receptor function may also result in a compensatory glutamatergic hyperactivity in cortical brain regions. In addition, long-term PCP administration results in depletion of prefrontal dopamine. One or more of these diverse effects may underlie the broad range of effects observed with NMDA receptor blockade.
Evidence to support a glutamate hypothesis is growing. Postmortem studies have documented abnormal NMDA, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptor binding in the prefrontal and temporal cortex, and abnormal NMDA and AMPA messenger RNA receptor expression in the hippocampus. Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from clinical trials that have examined the efficacy of agents that modify the activity of the NMDA receptor. Some, but not all, of these studies have shown that glycine and D-cycloserine, which bind to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, may be effective treatments for negative symptoms. They have also shown that both positive and negative symptoms may be treated by D-serine, which also binds to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, and by sarcosine, which inhibits glycine reuptake. Glycine transporter type 1 inhibitors, such as bitopertin, prevent reuptake of synaptic glycine and so enhance NMDA receptor function, but have not been shown to be effective for negative symptoms or cognitive impairments.
Treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The overall prevalence of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS, defined as non-response to two or more different antipsychotic drugs) is about 30%. Non-response to a first drug in the first episode occurs in about 15% of patients, and less than 20% of these will respond to switching to a second drug, unless it is clozapine. There is no evidence that combining two or more antipsychotic drugs is effective, and indeed doing so can be harmful as it raises the risk of side effects and high-dose prescribing.
It appears that people with TRS may have a different underlying pathology from that seen in responsive patients. In TRS, as well as evidence that the expected increase in striatal dopamine is absent, there is an increase in glutamate in the anterior cingulate cortex on magnetic resonance spectroscopy that is not seen in responsive patients. Recent genetic research has shown that copy number variants (CNVs) involving glutamate pathways are over-represented in people with TRS. These TRS studies build on other evidence for a glutamate hypothesis.
Does serotonin play a role?
Serotonergic neurons project from the Raphé nucleus in the brainstem to the basal ganglia and the limbic, thalamic and cortical regions throughout the brain (Figure 8.4). As with dopamine, several families of serotonin (5-HT) receptors have now been identified (Table 8.3). 5-HT was proposed as an important transmitter in schizophrenia before the dopamine hypothesis, mainly because of the psychotomimetic properties of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), which releases 5-HT. However, no direct supporting evidence has been found. It is only recently, in the light of the potent 5-HT 2a receptor antagonism of clozapine and the other second-generation antipsychotics, that 5-HT mechanisms have been seriously considered.
Postmortem studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia have fewer 5-HT 2a receptors in the frontal and temporal cortex, and reduced 5-HT 2a gene expression in the frontal cortex than controls. However, treatment studies with selective 5-HT 2a antagonists have not been encouraging, and functional imaging studies with 5-HT ligands have not been able to consistently replicate the observation of decreased 5-HT 2a receptors in the prefrontal cortex.
The roles of other serotonergic receptors have not been extensively studied, although the 5-HT 1a, 5-HT and 5-HT receptors may be promising targets for cognitive-enhancing drugs.
What about acetylcholine?
Acetylcholine acts at muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors. These receptors are broadly distributed throughout the brain, including the neocortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia. Acetylcholine modulates the release of a number of different neurotransmitters, including dopamine and glutamate. The M muscarinic receptor and the alpha beta and alpha nicotinic receptors may be particularly important in the regulation of cognitive functions. Cholinergic mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of attention, memory, processing speed and sensory gating processes, which are all impaired in people with schizophrenia. Furthermore, acute nicotine administration has been shown to improve attention, eye-tracking and sensory gating, as measured by P50 or prepulse inhibition (see page 61), in people with schizophrenia.
The GABA system?
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are extensively located on cerebral cortical interneurons and regulate cortical glutamatergic efferents. GABA receptors are also important in processing thalamic inputs to the cerebral cortex. GABA interneurons may be decreased in people with schizophrenia, with a possible selective decrease in GABA A receptors. Decreased GABAergic function may contribute to altered cortical function and the broad array of observed cognitive impairments.
Other neurotransmitters

9781912776207,ch4,"Accurate diagnosis and subtyping of PTCL is challenging but crucial, because it determines both prognosis and choice of therapy. The neoplastic nature of a given T-cell population is informed by its morphology, aberrant T-cell phenotype and clonality based on T-cell receptor (TCR) genotype (id est alphabeta versus gammaδ; see page 11). Accumulating evidence indicates that TCR genotype and the cell of origin influence tumor biology and clinical behavior, and are becoming increasingly clinically relevant as targeted therapeutic options emerge. Distinction between the PTCL subtypes requires consideration of the clinical picture, morphology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cytogenetics and molecular biology.
The symptoms of PTCL vary widely. Often, however, the only sign is an enlarged painless lymph node in the neck, armpit or groin. Some patients also experience generalized (constitutional) symptoms, known as B symptoms, which may include unexplained recurrent fevers over weeks, severe night sweats and significant unexplained weight loss. In the COMPLETE study, 46% of patients presented with B symptoms.
Skin rash may be present, particularly in patients with PTCL-NOS or AITL. Patients with AITL may also present with hypotension, fevers, rash and vasculitis-like symptoms, due to tumor-related cytokine release.
Some patients have more subtle symptoms, such as loss of appetite and fatigue, or symptoms specific to the type of lymphoma, such as joint pains resembling arthritis (which can be migratory), difficulty breathing or persistent dry cough. The liver or spleen may be enlarged. Characteristic presentations of the different subtypes of PTCL are shown in Table 4.1.
Examination and diagnostic work-up
Table 4.2 presents an overview of clinical evaluation, based on the MD Anderson Cancer Center practice algorithm and elaborated with the authors' clinical experience. Practice is likely to vary between centers.
During physical examination, particular attention should be paid to lymph node groups, including Waldeyer's ring, and to the size of the liver and spleen. B symptoms should be evaluated and performance status determined. Cardiac evaluation is required prior to chemotherapy.
Lymph node biopsy is essential. Either a core needle biopsy or, preferably, excision of the node is recommended to allow visualization of the broad pattern of lymph node infiltration. Fine needle aspirate is not sufficient for the diagnosis of T-cell lymphomas. Multiple cores should be obtained where possible, given the heterogeneity of many T-cell lymphomas, and to obtain adequate tissue for flow cytometry.
The initial immunohistochemistry panel should include: CD20, CD10, CD3, CD30, CD4, CD8, CD7, CD2, CD56, CD21, CD23, BCL6, Ki-67, ALK, TCRB and TCRg. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization (ISH) should be considered in cases suspected to be nasal ENKTCL. Molecular analysis should include TCR gene rearrangements, and fluorescence ISH to detect genetic alterations. DUSP22 and TP63 rearrangement studies should be considered in patients with ALK − ALCL, as this may affect prognosis.
Bone marrow biopsy. Because 30% of PTCL-NOS cases show bone marrow involvement, a biopsy is recommended as part of initial staging in all patients. Bone marrow aspirate should also be sent for flow cytometry and gene rearrangement studies.
Total body imaging is required for accurate staging. Imaging at diagnosis should include cross-sectional imaging of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, conventionally by contrast-enhanced CT, but increasingly using functional fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT. PET-CT is particularly useful for imaging extranodal PTCL and types of T-cell lymphoma presenting in the skin, and is recommended at staging and restaging; however, residual FDG-avid lesions lack specificity, and biopsy confirmation is recommended.
Histopathological analysis by an experienced hematopathologist is key to correct diagnosis and classification. Table 4.3 presents an overview of pathological diagnosis based on the MD Anderson Cancer Center practice algorithm and elaborated with the authors' clinical experience. Practice is likely to vary between centers.
Interpretation. The immunophenotypes of PTCL, TCR rearrangement and putative cell of origin are shown in Table 2.2 (page 19). Specific markers may be relevant to the classification of particular T-cell lymphomas.
The presence of at least three of the following markers indicates follicular T-helper cell origin: CD10, BCL-6, CXCL13, PD1, SAP, ICOS and CCR5; however, morphology should also be evaluated before diagnosing AITL.
CD21 and/or CD23 are useful in revealing follicular dendritic cells in AITL.
CD56 is helpful in differentiating between EATL and MEITL (CD8 + /CD56 − vs CD8 − /CD56 +); MEITL typically expresses a gammaδ-TCR phenotype and is not associated with celiac disease.
CD30 is always positive in ALCL, which is invariably PAX5 − and often EMA +, and one-third of cases are CD45 −. ALCL is further categorized as ALK + or ALK − depending on the presence or absence of the t(2;5) translocation (or one of its variants).
CD30 is variably positive in selected patients with other types of T-cell lymphoma, including EATL, AITL and PTCL-NOS.
CD20 and PAX5 allow the identification of B-cell components and can help in distinguishing ALK − ALCL from morphologically aggressive classic Hodgkin lymphoma (PAX5 +) with anaplastic features.
CD68 visualizes the histiocytic component, which may outnumber the neoplastic cell population (exempli gratia lymphoepithelioid PTCL-NOS, Lennert's variant and the lymphohistiocytic variant of ALCL).
Cytotoxic markers (TIA-1, granzyme B and perforin) are expressed in NK and gammaδ T-cell lymphomas and may indicate more aggressive clinical behavior.
EBV may be detected in a subset of patients with PTCL-NOS, AITL and in all cases of ENKTCL.
Diagnostic pitfalls
TCR clonality alone should be used with caution to establish or refute a diagnosis of PTCL. TCR clonality is negative in 20% of AITL cases, likely to be because of low tumor burden and contamination by non-malignant stromal cells. Conversely, TCR clonality can be positive in reactive entities, including autoimmune conditions and viral infections.
ALK + ALCL with small cell morphology (5-10% of cases) can be confused with CD30 + PTCL-NOS if ALK staining is not performed.
Up to 30% of AITL cases may demonstrate clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements but this does not fulfil the criteria for a composite B-cell lymphoma. Composite diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with AITL should be considered in the presence of sheet-like growth of large monoclonal B cells.
Hodgkin-like or Reed-Sternberg-like cells in AITL can mimic classic Hodgkin lymphoma. These cells are activated, usually EBV +, B cells.
Some reactive entities such as infectious mononucleosis, progressive transformation of germinal centers and Kikuchi disease can mimic PTCL.
Staging and grading
Most PTCLs are aggressive, so grading per se may not be relevant. Low-grade T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is uncommon and not well described.
The Ann Arbor staging system used to stage lymphomas (Table 4.4)is analogous to the tumor, nodes, metastases (TNM) system used for solid tumors. The clinical stage depends on where malignant tissue is identified and the presence of systemic B symptoms.
PTCL is usually aggressive, and outcomes are generally poor compared with aggressive B-cell lymphomas. For example, the International T-cell Lymphoma study reported overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival of 10% at 10-15 years in patients with PTCL-NOS. Chemokine expression and proliferative signature have been shown to have prognostic significance (Table 4.5).
Several prognostic indices have been developed, informed by studies which identified risk factors that predicted OS and progression-free survival (Table 4.6).
The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was developed in 1993 to identify factors that predict the prognosis of patients with aggressive NHL, as Ann Arbor stage alone did not adequately predict survival outcomes. The IPI has been shown to predict survival in patients with ALCL, AITL and PTCL-NOS, but not for other PTCL entities, and is the most commonly used prognostic index for T-cell lymphoma.
The Prognostic Index for T-cell Lymphomas (PIT) was developed in an attempt to produce more accurate prognostic indicators for PTCL subtypes. Retrospective univariate analysis of data from 385 PTCL-NOS cases identified factors associated with worse OS as:
age > 60 years
>= 2 extranodal sites
elevated or normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
performance status >= 2
stage III or IV disease
bone marrow involvement.
Multivariate analysis identified four independent risk factors - age, serum LDH, OS and bone marrow involvement. These were used to construct a prognostic model that stratified patients into four groups with 0, 1, 2 or more than 2 risk factors, with 5-year OS rates of 62%, 53%, 33% and 18%, respectively.
The modified Prognostic Index for T-cell Lymphoma (mPIT) replaced bone marrow involvement with expression of the proliferation-associated protein Ki-67. mPIT distinguishes good, intermediate and poor risk groups.
T cell score. The International T cell Project, established by the International Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Project in 2006, reported this new prognostic model in 2018. It is based on four of 12 explored covariates that maintained their prognostic value in multiple Cox proportional hazards regression analyses: serum albumin, performance status, stage and absolute neutrophil count. Three groups were identified: low risk (score 0; 48 patients [15%]), intermediate risk (score 1-2; 189 patients [61%]) and high risk (score 3-4; 74 patients [24%]), with 3-year OS rates of 76%, 43% and 11%, respectively.","<BULL> Many patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas present with systemic symptoms, and extranodal involvement is common. <BULL> Detailed immunophenotypic analysis is necessary to accurately diagnose PTCL subtypes. <BULL> PET scanning can be helpful to diagnose extranodal disease. <BULL> The International Prognostic Index and the PTCL-specific index are useful prognostic tools. <BULL> Epstein-Barr virus and CD30 are expressed in several subtypes of PTCL.","osing AITL. AITL-NOS is the most common type of T-cell lymphoma in the U.S. AITL is the most commonly diagnosed type of lymphoma in the United States.

The immediate, important first step in assessing a new headache is determining whether the headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical event requiring emergency evaluation and management. All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and discarded before considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition. Brain imaging, including neurovascular studies, may be needed as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurement and analysis and further evaluation by a neurologist.
Chronic headache
Assessment. As with all chronic pain, headache must be assessed systematically and classified according to its likely origin as well as its temporal pattern, aggravating and ameliorating factors and perpetuating factors and comorbidities. The headache diagnoses in Table 12.2 should be considered.
History. The history should note, as for any other pain, a general medical history, including a detailed pain history (Table 12.3). It is important to note whether the headache corresponds to any cycles (menstruation, weekends, circadian) or particular exposures (fumes, smoke, foods, etc).
As emotional factors often trigger tension or migraine headache, psychosocial assessment for the relationship of stressful events to headache onset and extant stressors or psychiatric comorbidities will be important for risk management and treatment planning. Diagnostic testing, particularly brain imaging, may be appropriate.
Pathophysiology and associated signs and symptoms
Recent literature has tended to blur what were once thought to be clear distinctions between headaches without a clear anatomic generator, such as tension headache compared with migraine headache. However, it is useful to consider migraine headache and tension headache differently for therapeutic reasons.
Migraine headache is now thought to be a condition in which there is cortical neuronal hyperexcitability and/or brainstem dysfunction which activates peripheral nociceptors of the trigeminal neurovascular system. An increase in excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and reduced intracortical inhibition are associated with meningeal inflammation and peripheral sensitization leading to dilation of cerebral vessels and pain. Further activation of the trigeminal nucleus leads to the characteristic signs of central sensitization usually associated with the clinical picture of full-blown migraine, during which almost any sensory stimulus will worsen the headache. These signs and symptoms include allodynia over the face and head, photophobia and sensitivity to noise or movement, causing patients to want to lie down in a dark, completely quiet room until the headache passes. There appears to be a genetic predisposition to migraine in some patients.
Tension headache, thought to be due to myofascial pain in the muscles of the head and neck, may be activated by stress and postural factors, or by neural stimuli from an old injury and/or cervical spine disease. These headaches can themselves activate a migraine headache in some patients.
Transform headache, often called rebound headache, is caused when the pain-suppressing effects of a short-acting sedative, anxiolytic and/or analgesic wear off so that the manifestations of the sensitized state of the central nervous system (CNS) resumes, often leading to daily headache. Hence caution against the regular, daily or almost daily use of these drugs for headache control is advised.
Sinus headache is caused by allergy- or infection-induced sinus inflammation with subsequent blockage and increased pressure.
Psychological processes. Stress is the most common trigger of both migraine ( around 75%) and tension headache, and like all persistent or recurrent pain, the headaches themselves and their effects on function and quality of life can be stressful to patients, their families and their associates. As with all pain syndromes, the cycle of pain-stress-pain-dysfunction-stress-pain etc. in headache should be identified, and treatments targeted to each of the predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors to whatever degree is possible.
Physical examination
While many common headaches can be diagnosed by history alone, to rule out dangerous causes, physical examination of the head and neck and cranial nerves as well as physiological parameters such as vital signs (exempli gratia fever) and mental status (with particular attention being paid to neurological function) is necessary. For example, palpation over the occipital nerve can precipitate the pain of occipital neuralgia and trigger points in the neck and trapezius can radiate rostrally causing headache. Palpation of a very prominent and sensitive superficial temporal artery can point to a possible diagnosis of temporal arteritis; this is a crucial diagnosis because if left untreated blindness is a likely complication.
Signs and symptoms of cervical spine pathology, such as tenderness over upper cervical facet joints may point to a need for imaging of the cervical spine and possible diagnostic medial branch blocks; this could lead to a diagnosis of 'cervicogenic headache'. As emotional factors often trigger tension or migraine headaches, psychosocial assessment for stressors or psychiatric comorbidity is important.
Diagnostic testing, particularly brain imaging, may be appropriate to rule out intracerebral causes.
Diagnostic tests
For most chronic headaches, diagnostic tests are unnecessary except when a 'red flag' on history or physical examination indicates concern for an intracerebral mass and the need for imaging, or history and physical examination indicate a need for spinal evaluation and related imaging. In occipital neuralgia, sometimes neural blockade of the occipital nerves can help with diagnosis. Administration of indometacin (indomethacin) results in complete relief of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) and this effect continues with long-term treatment. Cluster headache diagnosis may be aided by the autonomic features and at least partial response to inhaled oxygen.
Migraine. The treatment approach for migraine is best conceptualized as longitudinal chronic disease management in three parts: preventive measures, abortive treatment and symptom management. This approach is based on understanding the phenomenological pattern of each individual's headache, as in Figure 12.1.
First, preventive treatments aim to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of attacks and include daily use of medications such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, alpha -agonists, and beta-blockers (Table 12.4).
Second, once prodromal or actual migraine symptoms occur, a stepped-care approach should be taken (Table 12.5). It is important to avoid frequent regular dosing (more than twice weekly) of short-acting analgesics or sedatives such as compounds containing butalbital (a short-acting barbiturate often compounded with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or paracetamol [acetaminophen]), to reduce the incidence of transform (rebound) daily headaches.
Psychotherapies, such as support/directive and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), may help patients manage a complex interaction of factors that perpetuate headache.
Botulinum toxin injections have been reported to be successful in some case series, but the clinical trials are equivocal; a trial should be reserved for treatment-resistant patients.
For intractable migraine and occipital neuralgia, non-invasive methods of vagal neurostimulation and transcranial magnetic neurostimulation may serve as useful adjuncts to more conventional therapies. Trials of more invasive forms of neuromodulation in the form of temporary insertion of suboccipital electrodes result in about 50% of these patients proceeding to permanent implantation of electrodes with a pulse generator.
Tension headache. Management of episodic tension-type headaches starts with understanding the precipitants of the headaches. This is best accomplished by a headache diary in which the patient records all headaches and their contexts, either in a small notebook, on headache diary sheets or in a personal digital assistant (PDA). Once precipitants are identified, intervention strategies should proceed as follows.
For stress-induced headache, a stress management program, usually delivered in CBT, that trains the patient to avoid and/or manage precipitating stressors and to relax and stretch at onset of headache.
For positional headache, such as that activated by poor ergonomics at a computer terminal, positional and seating changes, stretching routines and icing can be helpful.
At the onset of headache, modulation techniques are initiated, such as stretching and icing, and relaxation techniques. Usually analgesics such as NSAIDs or paracetamol suffice, although other medications such as tramadol may be tried in more severe forms. The medical custom in some countries, such as the USA, includes use of pills, combining a barbiturate, butalbital, and caffeine with paracetamol or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin). Regular and frequent use (more than two to three times weekly) of these and other short-acting sedatives and anxiolytics as well as opioids should be avoided because of the potential for developing transform (rebound) headache, medication dependency or even addiction.
Occipital neuralgia. Pressure over occipital nerves or nerve injury due to trauma or surgery may activate headache symptoms. Nerve block may eliminate headache symptoms temporarily or for extended periods. Such blocks do not accurately predict the outcome of trial suboccipital nerve stimulation (see above).
Myofascial headache. Treatment includes awareness and avoidance of triggers, such as posture and stress. Analgesics are used with usual cautions. Trigger point injections may give short-term benefit, and physical therapy may be helpful.","<BULL> In patients without history of chronic headaches, determine whether an acute new headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition. <BULL> In chronic headache:- use a headache diary to differentiate headache type and establish pattern of triggers to enable self-management strategies- institute preventive measures such as trigger avoidance, stress control and medication- institute abortive regimen appropriate for headache type- migraine: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress control, triptans- tension/myofascial: NSAIDs, stress control, icing, stretching- avoid regular frequent analgesic use to reduce incidence of transform (rebound) headache physical dependency."," often trigger tension or migraine headaches, psychosocial assessment for stressors or psychiatric comorbidity is important.Psychosocial assessment of stressors and psychiatric comorbidities is important.Diagnostic testing, particularly brain imaging, may be appropriate to rule out intracerebral causes.Diagnostic tests, particularly brain imaging and related imaging may be appropriate.For most chronic headaches, diagnostic tests are unnecessary except when a'red flag' on history or physical examination indicates concern for an intracerebral mass and the need for imaging, or history and physical examination indicate a need for spinal evaluation and related imaging.

9781912776726,ch2,"Clinical presentation
Most patients with glioblastoma present with a clinical history of 3-6 months, although a small proportion have rapid onset of symptoms, clinically similar to a stroke. A full clinical history and physical examination, including neurological examination and assessment of performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group or Karnofsky performance status score) and cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination score), will help guide the investigations required to make a definitive diagnosis. Problems with, for example, vision, hearing, balance, reflexes, coordination and/or strength may provide an indication of the location of the tumor (see below). Treatment of the key signs and symptoms is described in Chapter 5.
Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of surrounding brain tissue and secondarily from the effects of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the tumor and edema. There is no fixed pattern of symptom progression; specific signs and symptoms will vary from person to person depending on the area of the brain that is affected (see Typical locations, Table 1.1).
Neurological deficit. Patients commonly experience focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, sensory loss or visual field defects, reflecting the location of the tumor. Patients with frontal tumors often present with cognitive deficits, a change in personality or a mood disorder and are often mistakenly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Five percent of patients present with aphasia due to a tumor in the speech-dominant hemisphere, which may be mistaken for confusion or delirium. Patients with larger tumors may also experience incontinence and difficulties with gait due to mass effect.
Seizures. Around 20-40% of patients present with seizures, which are most commonly associated with tumors of the temporal lobe. Up to 50% of patients have seizures later in the disease course. These may be simple partial seizures, where the electrical disturbance is limited to a specific area of one cerebral hemisphere and consciousness is retained, or complex partial seizures, in which consciousness is impaired or lost. Partial seizures may spread to cause a generalized seizure, classified as partial seizures secondarily generalized.
Raised intracranial pressure can occur as a result of increasing tumor size and surrounding edema. Headaches due to raised ICP occur in up to 50% of patients. They are usually unilateral, with a non-specific pattern of pain and increasing severity. Patients may also present with other symptoms of raised ICP, such as nausea, vomiting and papilledema.
Symptom prevalence
A systematic review identified symptom prevalence in patients at different stages of their glioma treatment. Glioblastoma is grade IV disease and so is not formally staged. The most common symptoms are shown in Table 2.1; other symptoms included alopecia, anorexia, anxiety/depression, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, gait disturbance, nausea/vomiting, pain, right-left confusion, sensory deficits, skin problems, urinary incontinence and visual defects.
Eight of the ten most prevalent symptoms shown in Table 2.1 (excluding confusion and dysphagia) are included in at least two of the three assessment tools for patient-reported outcome measures: the brain cancer-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BN20), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) module. These instruments are mostly used in clinical trials or research studies as a means of monitoring disease trajectory and the effect of treatments on quality of life and symptoms (Figure 2.1). They are important, as good symptom management has been shown to improve survival in other diseases such as lung cancer; however, symptoms are predominantly caused by the tumor, and to a lesser degree by the treatment.
Note: these may occur at different phases in the disease trajectory (see Figure 2.1). Adapted from data in IJzerman-Korevaar et al. 2018.
Confusion (40.3%), dysphagia (41.9%) and dyspnea (17.7%) are more prevalent at the end of life than during diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. A higher prevalence of confusion is seen at the end of life in patients with primary brain tumors than in patients with brain metastases or a general palliative care population. Aside from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life in cancer, such as anorexia and weight loss, tend to occur less often in patients with glioma than in other patients receiving palliative care. A study that compared 65 patients with glioblastoma at postsurgical baseline versus 130 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, reported that patients with glioblastoma frequently experience fatigue, suggesting that factors other than those related to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, such as depression and tumor localization, have a significant impact. Thus, patients require tailored symptom care at different times during the course of their disease.","<BULL> The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of the surrounding brain tissue and from the effects of increased intracranial pressure due to increasing tumor size and surrounding edema. <BULL> The most prevalent symptoms of glioblastoma are neurological in nature.

9781910797815,chp2,"The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are rare disorders associated with significant morbidity and, to varying extents, decreased life expectancy. Population-based epidemiology data are heterogeneous, possibly reflecting the changing classification of the disorders over time, misdiagnoses and problems with case ascertainment. However, recent meta-analyses and population-based registry studies have provided useful insights into the epidemiology of the MPNs.
Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are the most common MPNs and, together with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), account for about one-third of all newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies. The incidence and prevalence of these MPNs has been investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 studies conducted worldwide. The crude annual incidence for the MPNs combined was 2.58 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval 1.90-3.50), with individual studies yielding rates of 1.15-4.99 per 100 000 (Table 2.1). ET had the highest incidence, followed by PV and PMF.
In general, incidence was similar in men and women in the systematic review, although the incidence of ET was numerically higher in women (Table 2.1). By contrast, real-world data from the UK population-based Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) show that age-standardized incidence is similar for ET, PV and MPN, unclassifiable, whereas myelofibrosis is approximately twice as common in men as in women.
Most of the available epidemiology data are from Europe and North America; the incidence of the MPNs is similar in these two regions, as shown in Table 2.2.
The meta-analysis also showed that the MPNs are rare in children and adolescents. The pooled annual incidence in children aged <=16 years was 0.003 per 100 000 for PMF and 0.004-0.11 per 100 000 for ET; no data on pediatric PV were reported.
Studies from Europe and North America have reported prevalence rates of 11.0-42.5 per 100 000 for ET, 0.49-46.88 per 100 000 for PV, and 1.76-4.05 per 100 000 for PMF. One North American study reported an overall prevalence for all chronic MPNs in the general population of 93.3 per 100 000.
Prevalence in the UK reported by the HMRN is shown in Table 2.3. In general, the prevalence of each condition is similar in men and women.
In general, patients with ET or PV have a near-normal life expectancy with current treatment strategies, whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. The UK HMRN has reported 3-year relative survival rates of more than 90% in patients with the chronic MPNs (ET, PV, MPN, unclassifiable) compared with fewer than 70% in those with myelofibrosis (Figure 2.1). However, the emergence of new and improved treatments in recent years has markedly improved survival rates. For example, the introduction of phlebotomy as a routine treatment for PV increased median survival from less than 2 years to approximately 14 years.
Risk factors
Genetic predisposition. In addition to the presence of the driver mutations described in Chapter 1, age is a predominant risk factor for the MPNs. In the UK HMRN study, the median age at diagnosis in people with chronic MPNs was 70-74 years (Table 2.4). PV tended to be diagnosed at an earlier age in men than in women.
An estimated 7-8% of individuals with apparently sporadic MPN have a family history with at least two cases of MPN, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Such familial cases are presumed to be due to acquisition of the somatic driver mutation through a genetic predisposition. To date, familial MPN has been identified in only a small number of families; however, identification of such cases may facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate intervention.
Other risk factors for the MPNs have been proposed (Table 2.5), although in many cases the supporting evidence is limited. Two major long-term epidemiology studies have reported strong evidence that increased body mass index and smoking have significant associations with some or all of the MPNs.","<BULL> The incidence of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is approximately 2.6 per 100 000. <BULL> Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is the most common, with an incidence of approximately 1.0 per 100 000, followed by polycythemia vera (PV) (0.8) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (0.5). <BULL> Recent data from the UK suggest that the incidence of ET and PV is similar in men and women, whereas PMF is twice as common in men. <BULL> MPNs primarily affect older individuals: the median age at diagnosis is 70-74 years. <BULL> ET and PV are associated with near-normal life expectancy whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. <BULL> Risk factors that may increase the risk of MPNs include higher body mass index, smoking and some occupational exposures.","The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are rare disorders associated with significant morbidity and, to varying extents, decreased life expectancy.

9781910797433,ch05,"Surgery is the cornerstone of management for both early and advanced ovarian cancer, although the aims are different in each case.
In patients with presumed early disease, the aim of surgery is to remove the primary tumor, along with adequate peritoneal and lymphogenic staging.
In advanced disease, the aim is to achieve maximal cytoreduction and tumor reduction.
Surgery for primary ovarian cancer
Surgical management of primary ovarian cancer may involve non-fertility-sparing and fertility-sparing approaches (Figure 5.1).
Non-fertility-sparing surgery consists of cytological staging, removal of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus, peritoneal biopsies and lymph node dissection (Table 5.1). In addition, appendicectomy should be considered in patients with mucinous histology, or if the appendix appears abnormal.
Depending on the histological grade and tumor subtype, up to 30% of patients with apparently early epithelial ovarian cancer will be upstaged after comprehensive peritoneal and lymph node staging. - The only prospective randomized trial to have compared lymph node sampling alone with systematic lymph node dissection found that 13% of patients with lymph node involvement would be missed with lymph node sampling alone; this clearly has important implications for tumor staging and choice of adjuvant treatment. However, in this study, systematic lymph node dissection was not associated with a significant survival benefit compared with sampling alone, partly because of a lack of statistical power but also because of common use of chemotherapy in the sampling arm, which seemed to potentially compensate for the less radical dissection. Increasing evidence shows that the prevalence of positive lymph nodes in stage IA mucinous cancer is extremely low, and that there is no value in performing surgery that can lead to unnecessary morbidity.
Fertility-sparing surgery should be considered and discussed in younger patients and those with early-stage disease. Patients should be informed about the risks and benefits of such an approach, and the potentially higher risk of local relapse, which depends on their individual risk profile.
Patients with stage IA ovarian cancer and favorable histology (low-grade mucinous, serous, endometrioid or mixed histology) have been shown to have a lower risk after fertility-preserving surgery than patients with a higher disease stage or tumor grade. In large retrospective analyses, women with grade 3 disease or stage IC3 with clear cell histology had a higher risk of recurrence (Figure 5.2), which was mainly related to the higher incidence of extra-ovarian spread in grade 3 tumors rather than to a higher relapse rate in the preserved ovary. In retrospective studies, the risk of positive contralateral pelvic lymph nodes in women with unilateral disease despite negative ipsilateral nodes was as high as 11%., For this reason, staging of pelvic lymph nodes should be bilateral.
In advanced stages, maximal cytoreduction aimed at achieving complete tumor clearance has been shown to be associated with significant increases in both overall and progression-free survival. - A meta-analysis of 53 studies and 6885 patients, from 1989 to 1998, showed that every 10% reduction in tumor was associated with a 6.3% prolongation of median overall survival.
Resection techniques
In order to achieve total macroscopic tumor clearance in peritoneally disseminated disease, a maximal surgical effort is required, incorporating multivisceral resection techniques such as:
extensive peritoneal stripping
full thickness diaphragmatic resection
removal of bulky pelvic/para-aortic lymph nodes
bowel resection.
Extra-abdominal cytoreductive procedures are increasingly being used to achieve complete tumor clearance outside the abdominal cavity. Techniques such as cardiophrenic/paracardiac lymph node dissection, pleurectomy, and supraclavicular and axillary lymph node dissection may be applied. Surgical expertise and training, with continuous audit of surgical outcome, morbidity and survival, have been proven to be important tools in making such extensive surgery safe for the patient without unnecessarily increasing morbidity. For this reason, there is an increasing trend toward the use of such procedures only in specialized centers with adequate infrastructure, resources and training.
Pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is part of the debulking procedure in patients with bulky lymph nodes. In a randomized Phase III trial, the removal of these nodes only, compared with systematic lymph node dissection, was associated with a reduction in 5-year progression-free survival rates (21.6% versus 31.2%, respectively), with no significant difference in overall survival. Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy offers no benefit in advanced disease in the absence of bulky lymph nodes.
Timing of surgery
Cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer is generally performed at the time of diagnosis, when it is referred to as primary cytoreduction. It is also performed during primary chemotherapy, when it is referred to as interval cytoreduction, and after disease recurrence, which is called secondary or tertiary cytoreduction.
The optimal timing of surgery in relation to first-line chemotherapy is still under debate. Two prospective randomized trials, have reported lower surgical morbidity and comparable survival when neoadjuvant therapy was given, compared with upfront surgery, but whether these findings can be generalized to patients with good performance status treated in specialized centers is unclear.
Ongoing trials (TRUST, AGO OVAR OP 7) are investigating the optimal timing of surgery, and will also address issues such as the optimal management of fragile patients.
Surgery for relapsed ovarian cancer
Despite the established value of cytoreduction in the primary tumor setting, the value of tumor debulking surgery for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is not well defined. These patients have a chronic condition and hence quality of life needs to be carefully balanced with the surgical risks.
Secondary cytoreduction. The DESKTOP I trial retrospectively evaluated the survival benefit of secondary debulking in patients with ovarian cancer, sensitive to platinum chemotherapy. Complete tumor resection increased survival, compared with those with residual tumor (median 45.2 versus 19.7 months; hazard ratio [HR] 3.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.27-6.05, p < 0.0001). Using these data, the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie (AGO) determined that complete tumor resection was feasible in patients with recurrent disease provided they had:
good performance status
complete resection at primary surgery, or early FIGO stage (I/II)
absence of gross ascites at relapse.
Patients that met all three of these criteria were given a positive AGO score.
An exploratory analysis of the DESKTOP results to evaluate the role of peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer clearly showed that, even though peritoneal carcinomatosis was a negative predictor for complete resection in patients with recurrent disease, it appeared to have no independent negative impact on survival if total macroscopic clearance could be achieved.
The prospective, multicenter DESKTOP II trial, subsequently validated the AGO score, confirming its usefulness and reliability for predicting the benefit of complete tumor resection in more than two-thirds of patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed epithelial ovarian cancer. Of 516 patients screened over 19 months, 261 (51%) were classified as AGO score-positive and 129 of them with first relapse underwent secondary tumor debulking. The rate of complete resection was 76%. Interestingly, there was a poor correlation between imaging findings and intraoperative findings, both in terms of the number of lesions and localization of the tumor.
Perioperative morbidity and mortality appeared to be acceptable in the DESKTOP studies, with 0.8% mortality, 11% re-laparotomy (mainly due to bowel leakage or fistula in 7% of patients) and 2% deep vein thrombosis; 52% of patients required postoperative treatment in intensive care (median 2 days, range 1-20).
Similar findings have been reported in other patient series. A meta-analysis of data from 40 patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, spanning 24 years, showed that after controlling for all other disease-related factors, every 10% increase in the proportion of patients undergoing complete cytoreductive surgery was associated with a 3-month increase in median cohort survival time.
Tertiary cytoreduction. The largest multicenter analysis of tertiary cytoreductive surgery evaluated 406 patients (median age 55 years; range 16-80) who underwent surgery between 1997 and 2011 in 12 centers across Europe, the USA and Asia. Most of the patients had initial FIGO stage III/IV disease (69%), peritoneal carcinomatosis (51.7%) and absence of ascites (72.2%). The most frequent tumor dissemination site was the pelvis (73%). In total, 224 patients (54.1%) underwent complete tumor resection. This study confirmed that - even in the tertiary setting - complete macroscopic tumor clearance is a significant predictor of both overall and progression-free survival. Median overall survival for patients without residual tumor was 49 months (95% CI 42.5-56.4) compared with 12 months (95% CI 9.3-14.7) in patients with residual tumor (p < 0.001). By contrast, peritoneal carcinomatosis was not prognostic for survival after controlling for residual tumor status. Importantly, common clinicopathological characteristics such as tumor stage, age and histological subtype, which have been shown to be significant predictors of survival at initial presentation, did not appear to be of any prognostic significance at the tertiary stage. Multivariate analysis identified platinum resistance, residual tumor at secondary surgery and peritoneal carcinomatosis to be of predictive significance for complete tumor resection, while residual tumor at secondary and tertiary surgery, decreasing time to second relapse, ascites, upper abdominal tumor involvement and non-platinum third-line chemotherapy significantly affected overall survival.
A further clinically relevant finding was the significant impact of third-line postoperative systemic chemotherapy on overall survival, emphasizing the importance of a combination of systemic chemotherapy and surgical intervention, even in this heavily pretreated patient population. (This may reflect a selection bias, because those patients who were fit enough and able to tolerate chemotherapy following radical surgery may theoretically have had more favorable survival rates than patients who were too weak to tolerate any systemic treatment or in whom chemotherapy was contraindicated.)
Major operative morbidity and 30-day mortality rates were 25.9% and 3.2%, respectively; these are slightly higher than the equivalent data in the DESKTOP studies in the secondary treatment setting, but it should be noted that the study included both platinum-sensitive patients in whom cytoreduction was intended and symptomatic patients who underwent palliative surgery aimed at ameliorating their symptoms. The most common complication was infection/sepsis in 13% of patients; the re-laparotomy rate was 4.4%, but this was not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events (2.5%).

In addition, there may be a bias in the treatment of patients with metastatic ovarian cancer, which may be due to the high risk of recurrence.In addition, there is a bias in treatment of metastatic ovarian cancer in patients with metastatic metastatic metastatic ovarian cancer.Surgical management of primary ovarian cancer may involve non-fertility-sparing and fertility-sparing approaches (Figure 5.1).Surgical management of ovarian cancer may involve:Non-fertility-Sparing surgery consists of cytological staging, removal of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus, peritoneal biopsies and lymph node dissection (Table 5.1). In addition, appendicectomy should be considered in patients with mucinous histology, or if the appendix appears abnormal.Surgical management may involve:Depending on the histological grade and tumor subtype, up to 30% of patients with apparently early epithelial ovarian cancer will be upstaged after comprehensive peritoneal and lymph node staging. - The only prospective randomized trial to have compared lymph node sampling alone with systematic lymph node dissection found that 13% of patients with lymph node involvement would be missed with lymph node sampling alone; this clearly has important implications for tumor staging and choice of adjuvant treatment. However, in this study, systematic lymph node disSection was not associated with a significant survival benefit compared with sampling alone, partly because of a lack of statistical power but also because of common use of chemotherapy in the sampling arm, which seemed to potentially compensate for the less radical dissection. Increasing evidence shows that the prevalence of positive lymph nodes in stage IA mucinous cancer is extremely low, and that there is no value in performing surgery that can lead to unnecessary morbidity.Surgical management for metastatic ovarian cancer may include:Patients that met all three of these criteria were given a positive AGO score.Patients that met the AGO score were given a negative AGO score.An exploratory analysis of the DESKTOP results to evaluate the role of peritoneal carcinomatosis in recurrent"
9781910797617,chp1,"Epidemiology, pathophysiology and etiology
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that affects the blood and bone marrow. The build up of abnormal white blood cells interferes with the production of red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells, and indirectly leads to leukemic complications of infection, fatigue and hemorrhage. Complications also arise directly from the proliferation and accumulation of immature leukemia cells, which can affect blood flow or infiltrate other organs. The pathogenesis is described in more detail on page 9.
Incidence data specific for AML worldwide are limited, as AML is usually included within the broader category of leukemia in epidemiology registries such as GLOBOCAN. The incidence of AML in the USA is 4.2 per 100 000 per year, with an estimated 21 380 new cases in 2017. AML accounts for about 1.3% of all new cancer cases and 31% of all new leukemia cases. In the UK in 2014, there were 3072 new cases of AML (fewer than 1% of all new cancer cases); there the incidence has risen by 28% since the early 1990s. Annual incidence rates differ little between large datasets from the USA (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results), the UK (Cancer Research UK), and Sweden (Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry). Data from developing countries are sparse. AML is rare compared with other cancers, but is the most common acute leukemia in adults.
Age, sex and ethnicity. While AML affects all age groups, the incidence increases with advancing age (Figure 1.1), presenting at a median age of 67-69 years. AML is slightly more common in men than women, particularly in the older age groups. It is more commonly diagnosed in developed countries and is more common in white than in other populations.
Survival. AML is universally fatal if untreated. Even with treatment, patients seldom survive long term: according to US registry data, only 27% of patients survive 5 years from diagnosis. Survival is particularly poor in older patients, with fewer than 10% surviving 5 years. This is attributed to a marked increase in intrinsic chemoresistance with age and a greater number of comorbidities that compromise tolerance to chemotherapy. Some older patients do not receive treatment for AML because of these concerns, although data from the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry demonstrate that this population benefits from treatment instead of purely palliative care., Figure 1.2 shows overall survival estimates by age group for patients in the Swedish registry.
AML is a hematologic malignancy arising from hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cells in the bone marrow (Figure 1.3). Clonal immature myeloid progenitor cells accumulate in the blood, bone marrow and, occasionally, extramedullary tissues. While these cells can divide and proliferate, they do not differentiate (mature) into functional cells (id est neutrophils).
As noted above, patients experience complications directly from the accumulation of abnormal immature myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts) and indirectly from the reduction in functional myeloid cells and other mature hematopoietic elements. The leukemic involvement of the bone marrow often results in pancytopenia - patients may present with cytopenias in all hematopoietic cell lineages. Patients typically require transfusions of red blood cells and platelets and are at risk of life-threatening infectious complications due to neutropenia. Most patients with AML die from infection or, to a lesser extent, hemorrhage.
The role of genetics
Advances in genetics have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML. Although in-depth understanding of the relationship between a specific genetic mutation and a specific pathophysiological or clinical feature is clear in only a few cases, this is slowly changing. One such example is the association of the PML-RARA fusion gene with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of AML (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The PML-RARA fusion gene is typically detected as a chromosomal rearrangement: t(15;17)(q22;q21).
Patients with APL have a high risk for fatal hemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the consequence of a halt in myeloid differentiation that is mediated by the PML-RARA fusion gene. The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development. In normal cells, RARA encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors; PML is important in controlling proliferation and apoptosis, among other processes. The PML-RARA fusion protein suppresses gene transcription and blocks differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage, resulting in the accumulation of malignant promyelocytes seen in APL. Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage. The complex role of the PML-RARA fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood. Treatment of APL is unique and ultimately capitalizes on these unique pathophysiological findings (though clinical advances preceded genetic understanding in this case; see pages 49-50 for the treatment of APL).
Our understanding of the relationships between other genetic lesions and the pathophysiology of AML is limited but growing rapidly; it is hoped that understanding these relationships will identify new drug targets and enable novel therapies to be developed (exempli gratia midostaurin and enasidenib, see Chapter 3).
Genetic sequencing studies suggest that most cases of AML arise from a limited number of mutations that accumulate with age. For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (cancergenome.nih.gov) and other databases have shown that up to 5-6% of healthy individuals over 70 years of age have blood cells that contain potentially 'premalignant' mutations that are associated with clonal expansion (reviewed in TCGA Research Network 2013). However, the final insults that subsequently direct premalignant blood cells to become leukemic are many and remain poorly understood.
Sequencing data demonstrate the surprising finding that AML is associated with far fewer mutations than most other adult cancers: adults with AML have an average of 13 genetic mutations, in stark contrast to melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, which typically have several hundred, as illustrated in Figure 1.4.
TCGA has also shown that, on average, only five of 13 mutations found in a typical patient with AML are in genes known to be frequently mutated in AML. Despite the relatively low number of known mutations, there is tremendous heterogeneity in the types of mutation found in patients with AML. Furthermore, genetic analysis of serial samples from patients suggests that the pathogenesis of the disease is (at least in most cases) not rooted in a single mutation but in complex relationships between the accumulated (but limited number of) mutations.
Several datasets have grouped mutations into categories in an attempt to understand these relationships. For example, TCGA reported that almost all samples had at least one mutation in one of nine categories defined according to biological function and that are thought to have a role in the pathogenesis of AML (Table 1.1).
Figure 1.5 shows the frequency of mutation for the most commonly mutated genes, which include FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH2 and IDH1, in a group of 200 patients with newly diagnosed AML.
The circos plot in Figure 1.6 shows the complex relationship between mutations in patients with AML. Some mutated genes are frequently (and typically) observed in the presence of other specific gene mutations, such as NPM1 with FLT3 (red ribbon); other gene mutations are mutually exclusive, such as IDH1, IDH2 and TET2.
Even in a single patient, all AML cells are not equal. Genetic sequencing studies have shown that relevant genetic variation occurs within the bone marrow cells from an individual patient with AML. Each group of cells with a shared mutation profile is called a clone; typically patients have one dominant clone and several smaller subclones. The presence of genetically different clones and subclones of myeloid blasts helps explain why a single patient may achieve remission but then experience relapse with more-resistant disease - sensitive clones are eliminated by chemotherapy, whereas surviving clones are more resistant to further rounds of chemotherapy; this is illustrated conceptually in Figure 1.7. One clone may be eliminated over time (and following treatment), whereas another may persist or emerge with additional novel mutations. Figure 1.8 illustrates clonal evolution in an actual patient. Mutational analyses like these explain why patients with morphologically similar leukemias may experience vastly different clinical outcomes.
Sequencing studies suggest that the development of individualized therapies that target unique mutations in selected patients, rather than a 'one way fits all' chemotherapy approach (described in Chapter 3), may improve outcomes for patients with AML. Several recent successful examples of this treatment approach are discussed in detail in Chapter 3. However, it is increasingly recognized that, in most patients, several subclones (oligoclonal) rather than a single clone contribute to the leukemia. This genetic diversity, even in a single patient, may limit the effectiveness of monotherapy with targeted agents and calls for a multitargeted approaches, including combinations with conventional chemotherapy. The use of targeted therapies to improve disease control before the use of potentially curative immunologic and decidedly non-targeted therapy (exempli gratia allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, see Chapter 3) is another area of ongoing research.
Most cases of AML are idiopathic, arising in previously healthy individuals with no (or unknown) genetic predisposition. Advancing age is the main risk factor for AML, as noted above and described by TCGA, but a number of other risk factors contribute to the development of AML in some patients. These include familial risk, environmental exposure to chemicals, drugs or ionizing radiation, and antecedent hematologic disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
Familial risk. Although most cases of AML are not familial, it is now clear that myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition (exempli gratia an inherited risk) are more frequent than has been recognized previously. Myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition - that is, AML and related disorders that arise in the setting of an inherited genetic mutation which puts the patient at increased risk for developing the disease - are an important component of the forthcoming revision to the World Health Organization classification of AML (see Table 2.3). Germline mutations associated with an increased risk of developing a myeloid neoplasm occur in the CEBPA, DDX41, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6 and GATA2 genes, among others.
Myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition are a feature of several well-described clinical syndromes, including disorders of bone marrow failure (exempli gratia Fanconi anemia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, Diamond-Blackfan anemia) and telomere biology (exempli gratia dyskeratosis congenita). Likewise, several genetic syndromes with aberrations of somatic cell chromosome complement, such as Down syndrome with trisomy 21, are associated with an increased incidence of AML. Down syndrome-associated AML in young children (< 4 years) is typically of the acute megakaryocytic subtype (see Table 2.2 for the different morphologic subtypes) and is associated with a mutation in the GATA1 gene. Affected patients have favorable clinical outcomes but require lower doses of chemotherapy because of higher treatment-related toxicities. Inherited diseases with defective DNA repair (exempli gratia Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia) are also associated with AML. Each of these syndromes has unique clinical features and atypical toxicities after chemotherapy, requiring expert care.
Chemical and environmental exposure. Anticancer drugs are the leading cause of therapy-associated AML. Leukemias associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors typically occur 1-3 years after exposure; AML blasts in affected patients have a particular morphologic appearance with monocytic features. Patients who develop monocytic AML after exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors often also have a particular chromosomal abnormality that involves the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q23 rearrangements occur in AML and may be seen with many other partner chromosomes).
Alkylating agents may also cause leukemias, on average 4-6 years after exposure; affected individuals often have abnormalities in many cells lines (multilineage dysplasia) and monosomy/aberrations in chromosomes 5 and 7.
Exposure to ionizing radiation, benzene, chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone and other drugs, although rare, may result in bone marrow failure that evolves into AML.
Myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative neoplasms. Several disorders of myeloid cells are related to AML and are broadly classified as MDS and MPN, with tremendous heterogeneity within each group. Detailed description of these disorders is beyond the scope of this book, but it is important to understand that MDS or MPN may progress to AML, a condition which is referred to as secondary AML or AML arising from an antecedent hematologic disorder. The risk of progression of MDS to AML can be estimated based on the proportion of blasts in the marrow (MDS is defined as < 20% blasts), cytopenias, karyotype and other factors. MPN are further subclassified into familiar terms of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia, as well as other disorders such as mastocytosis and eosinophilic disorders associated with abnormalities of PDGFA/B or FGFR1, among others.","<BULL> Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relatively rare cancer.

It is important to note that AML is not a monoclonal disease. It is a malignant malignancy. It is not a malignancy. The malignancy is a malignancy that affects the blood and bone marrow. Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage. The complex role of the PML-RARA fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood. Treatment of APL is unique and ultimately capitalizes on these unique pathophysiological findings (though clinical advances preceded genetic understanding in this case; see pages 49-50 for the treatment of APL).The role of genetics in the development of AML is limited. The role of genetics is limited, as it is difficult to understand the relationship between AML and the pathophysiology of AML.

9781908541963,chapter3,"Alcoholic liver disease
Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In the USA, approximately 2 million people suffer from an alcohol-induced liver disorder. In the UK in 2012, ALD accounted for 63% (4425) of all alcohol-related deaths, an 18% increase on 2002. Medical costs associated with caring for these patients are enormous.
Alcohol-related liver injury presents a spectrum of disease, including asymptomatic hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), steatosis accompanied by inflammation (steatohepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis), cirrhosis with liver failure, variceal bleeding, ascites and even the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Intervention for patients presenting with the early stages of liver injury helps to prevent further permanent liver injury. Interrupting alcoholism is the key, but this is not an easy task and frustrates many primary care providers, families and patients.
Presentation. Patients may present anywhere along the spectrum of ALD. Those with isolated steatosis usually have few symptoms or signs of liver disease and are typically identified only by abnormal liver tests. Patients with alcoholic hepatitis are usually jaundiced and report fatigue, malaise and anorexia. The liver is enlarged and tender, and ascites and edema are often present. Patients with established cirrhosis usually display signs of portal hypertension, such as splenomegaly, caput medusae and ascites. In late-stage disease, the liver may be small and hard and there may be cutaneous stigmata of chronic liver disease, such as palmar erythema, spider nevi or telangiectasia (Figure 3.1). Gynecomastia and small shrunken testicles may be present in men. Diagnosis and treatment are summarized in Table 3.1.
Liver function tests. Examination of laboratory results is helpful in diagnosing ALD. The aminotransferases are elevated and have a characteristic pattern in patients with ALD: the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is almost always higher than the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and the greater the ratio the more likely that the liver disease is due to alcohol. Alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin levels may be increased, the prothrombin time (PT) prolonged and the albumin level depressed. The last two are good markers of the severity of ALD. However, it should also be noted that liver function tests may be entirely normal in the presence of cirrhosis, particularly if the patient has achieved sobriety.
Further investigations. Ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) images of the abdomen typically show parenchymal abnormalities suggestive of fatty changes in the liver (Figure 3.2), and may show a nodular outline typical of cirrhosis. Changes of portal hypertension, such as portosystemic collaterals and ascites, can also be seen on imaging studies. A liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing ALD and in documenting the severity of liver injury, but may not be required in all cases. This is particularly true when the patient's history is suggestive of ALD, there is no evidence of viral hepatitis and biopsy could be difficult (id est patients with coagulopathy or severe ascites).
Concomitant disease. It is important to rule out other forms of liver disease and to document any concomitant injurious agents. Chronic hepatitis C and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis B are common in patients with alcoholism. Although most patients who drink alcohol never develop significant liver disease, and many patients with viral hepatitis do well over long periods of time, the combination of viral hepatitis and alcoholism often accelerates the development of advanced liver injury. Thus, identification of a patient with both diseases is important.
There is an interesting parallel between ALD and the more recently recognized non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD; see Chapter 6), which is usually seen in patients with insulin resistance, obesity or diabetes. Both disorders are characterized by the deposition of fat (triglyceride) in the liver and progression through stages of inflammation to collagen deposition and fibrosis. Histologically, ALD and NAFLD appear identical, and some investigators feel that they differ only in the mechanism by which fat is originally deposited. Once fat appears in the liver, a similar progression of events occurs in some patients, resulting in irreversible scarring in the liver.
Determination of alcohol consumption. Although it seems self-evident, the diagnosis of ALD is made easier if it can be documented that the patient is drinking injurious amounts of alcohol (id est 80 g - about six drinks - per day for men and as little as 20 g per day for women). Accurate determination of alcohol consumption can be difficult, however, as patients often under-report how much alcohol they consume, and denial is common. The CAGE questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and reports from families may be helpful in identifying patients whose alcohol consumption is excessive (see Table 1.2).
It should be remembered, however, that small amounts of alcohol (1-2 drinks per day) are probably beneficial, as has been reported extensively in the medical literature and popularized by the lay press.
Small amounts of alcohol would not be expected to cause ALD in men and, if it can be confirmed that a patient consumes only a small amount of alcohol, other causes of liver disease must be considered.
The treatment of ALD essentially entails abstinence from alcohol, which is clearly the most important factor in promoting both short- and long-term survival. Achieving abstinence typically requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, professional alcoholism counselors and, often, mental health professionals. This requires a substantial commitment on the part of the patient and the patient's family. Ideally, the patient will be encouraged by the knowledge that, with cessation of alcohol intake, their liver function is likely to improve substantially.
Nutrition. Alcoholics are usually malnourished, and improving nutrition is associated with improved outcomes. This is particularly important for patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Anorexia may prevent adequate nutrition and feeding via an enteral tube is sometimes required. Most alcoholics need protein. Unfortunately, however, a few patients with advanced liver disease develop hepatic encephalopathy when given large amounts of protein. Consultation with dietitians may be beneficial.
Corticosteroids. Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammatory condition. Thus, corticosteroids are a logical treatment for ALD. However, despite many studies that have investigated the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, there is no clear consensus on their efficacy. Most hepatologists believe that patients with the most severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis - id est those with a Maddrey's discriminant function (DF) score greater than 32 - will benefit from a course of corticosteroids. The DF score is calculated with the simple formula:
4.6 x [prothrombin time - control time (seconds)] + bilirubin (mg/dL)
To calculate the DF using bilirubin in SI units (micromol/L) divide the bilirubin value by 17.
Recent data suggest that short-term survival may be enhanced by infusions of N -acetylcysteine.
Tumor necrosis factor. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been recorded in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and clinical outcome appears to correlate with TNF levels. Efforts to decrease TNF levels have shown some promise in the treatment of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. One study has documented that pentoxifylline improved survival in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, presumably by interfering with TNF.
Liver transplantation for patients with ALD remains a controversial topic. Most transplant centers will consider patients with ALD as candidates for transplantation provided they have a documented period of abstinence from alcohol of at least 6 months before transplantation is considered. Unfortunately, some patients do return to drinking following transplant, although long-term success is common.","<BULL> Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease. <BULL> Early intervention prevents permanent injury, but interrupting alcoholism can be difficult. <BULL> Patients with ALD typically have mild to moderate elevations in aminotransferases, with AST > ALT. <BULL> Patients with ALD are often malnourished; improving nutrition is an important treatment goal. <BULL> Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis may benefit from corticosteroids or pentoxifylline.","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease (ALD).

9781908541796,chapter1,"Lymphoma is a malignancy of lymphocytes and their progenitors. The term lymphoma encompasses a broad range of lymphoid malignancies, which is reflected in the complexity of the classification systems (see Appendix, page 131). Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is clinically useful, it is now recognized that many of the broader categories, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, include several distinct entities, each of which may have its own unique epidemiological and etiologic profile. Consequently, it is difficult to present an all-encompassing overview of the epidemiology of lymphoma.
Incidence and relevant factors
In the USA, Europe and Australasia the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is approximately 20 per 100 000 of the population, with a slightly higher incidence in men than in women. This makes lymphoma the sixth or seventh most common cancer worldwide.
Age. Overall, incidence increases with age, although some subtypes of lymphoma are more common in children and young adults (Table 1.1).
Sex. Although the overall incidence is 50% higher in men, the sexes are not equally affected by all lymphoma entities. For example, mantle cell lymphoma particularly affects men (> 70% of cases), whereas primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is more common in women.
Ethnicity. In the USA, the incidence of NHL is 50% higher in non-Hispanic white Americans than black Americans. However, in the UK, epidemiological data in white, Asian and black populations indicate no significant variation in incidence by ethnicity.
Geography. It has long been recognized that certain forms of lymphoma have an increased incidence in certain parts of the world (Figure 1.1). This association is particularly striking for endemic Burkitt lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; however, similar associations are also well established for other subtypes. Overall, NHL is most common in the USA, Western Europe and Australia (possibly reflecting the age demographics of these populations). However, Hodgkin lymphoma is considerably more common in the Middle East, with incidence rates almost double those of Western Europe.
Changes in incidence. Between 1973 and 1990, the annual incidence of NHL in the USA rose by 81% from 10.2 to 18.5/100 0000 (Figure 1.2); this increase was observed in all racial groups and in both sexes. This rate of increase has only been surpassed by lung cancer in women and melanoma in both sexes for which specific etiologic factors have been identified (smoking and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, respectively). Recent age-adjusted data in the USA (and UK) suggest, however, that since 1990 the incidence of NHL has plateaued. Interestingly, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma has also been stable.
Research into the reasons why the incidence of lymphoma increased so dramatically has failed to provide convincing answers. Improvements in diagnostic techniques and data registration for NHL are likely to have contributed to these trends, so interpretation of the data should be undertaken with caution.
Risk factors
Possible risk factors for lymphoma can be divided into two broad categories:
relatively uncommon risk factors that carry a high relative risk
common risk factors that carry a low relative risk.
With the exception of HIV infection (see below), none of the possible risk factors is known to have changed over time.
Relatively uncommon risk factors with high relative risk. Immuno-deficiency states are the most obvious examples of a relatively uncommon risk factor that carries a high relative risk. It has been suggested that the rising incidence of lymphoma during the 1980s and 1990s reflected an increasing incidence of immunodeficiency, most obviously due to the emergence of HIV and AIDS. Indeed, HIV/AIDS has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of lymphoma, but it accounts for less than 50% of the increase in incidence seen in the West. Furthermore, since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of AIDS-associated lymphoma has declined.
Common risk factors with low relative risk. Many environmental factors have been implicated in the development of lymphoma (see below). Most of these have been identified using case-control retrospective analyses, which have disadvantages, such as recall and selection bias, that can reduce the validity of the results. Further large prospective cohort studies are needed, some of which are ongoing. However, it must be remembered that a relatively innocuous environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk of developing lymphoma can contribute substantially to a rising incidence if a sufficiently large number of people are exposed. Nevertheless, it is not possible to test for every environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk.
Environmental causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Immunosuppression has two relatively common causes.
HIV infection increases the risk of developing NHL more than 100-fold. The lymphomas are generally aggressive: either diffuse large B-cell or Burkitt type (see Chapter 8).
Patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs following solid organ transplantation are at 30-50-fold increased risk of developing NHL; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is often a cofactor. The drugs impair T-cell control of EBV-driven polyclonal B-cell activation, resulting in polyclonal B-cell proliferation. A dominant B-cell clone can then evolve, resulting in lymphoma (see Chapter 8).
Infection (other than HIV) may be an acquired cause of lymphoma (Tables 1.2 and 1.3).
Inflammatory conditions. Certain inflammatory conditions predispose to the development of NHL and particularly extranodal marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, which are associated with organ-specific autoimmune conditions. For example, Sjögren syndrome (an autoimmune condition affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands) is associated with a 15-fold increased risk of developing salivary or lacrimal MALT lymphomas, and Hashimoto disease (an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid gland) predisposes to thyroid MALT lymphoma.
Pesticide/herbicide exposure has been implicated in the etiology of NHL in numerous studies. Agents include organophosphates, phenoxyacetic acid herbicides and triazine herbicides. However, the results are inconsistent with wide variations in the estimates of risk. Presumably this is because most investigations have been case-control studies in which the estimation of risk is fraught with difficulty. Some studies have also demonstrated an association between specific pesticides and herbicides and NHL subtypes but, again, the results are inconsistent.
Pesticide exposure is not only relevant to the small proportion of the population who work in agriculture, as studies have convincingly shown that pesticide exposure in the general population is increasing dramatically. Only a small (and therefore difficult to demonstrate) relative risk may account for a significant proportion of lymphoma cases.
Blood transfusion. Increased use of blood transfusions has coincided with the increased incidence of lymphoma. It has been postulated that the immunosuppressive action of a blood transfusion and/or the inherent risk of spreading bloodborne viruses is involved. However, results from cohort and case-control studies are conflicting.
EBV infects two types of cell
Epithelial cells, usually of the oropharynx, are thought to be the first cell type infected (primary infection). EBV actively replicates within the cell, causing it to lyse and shed virus, resulting in the familiar sore throat of glandular fever. As the cells lyse, the virus may then spread to B cells
Memory B cells are often infected. The virus becomes latent, which means that it does not undergo active replication and is hidden from the immune system. At this stage, only a few of the 100 or so viral genes are expressed. A number of latency proteins may act to cause cancer
Genetic causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Only a few inherited conditions predispose to lymphoma development. These conditions are largely primary immunodeficiency states. They are all rare and so do not contribute significantly to the overall prevalence of NHL. Examples include Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome and common variable immune deficiency. In each case, a cofactor such as EBV is needed for lymphoma development.
More subtle defects in immunoregulation are also hypothesized to increase the risk of NHL. A clear clustering of cases is seen in some families, but no genetic abnormalities have been found. These may either represent cases of a shared environmental exposure or an as yet undiscovered genetic susceptibility.","<BULL> The epidemiology of lymphoma is difficult to study owing to the existence of so many different subtypes of the disease, each with its own epidemiology and associated causative factors. <BULL> The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s but has plateaued in recent years. <BULL> An understanding of the epidemiology has, in some instances, led to an understanding of causative factors such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. <BULL> Various other subtypes of lymphoma have been linked with infection, particularly immunosuppression-related lymphomas caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas caused by various bacterial infections. <BULL> Large cohort studies are required to verify many of the potential causative factors.","Lymphoma is a malignancy of lymphocytes and their progenitors. The term lymphoma encompasses a broad range of lymphoid malignancies, which is reflected in the complexity of the classification systems (see Appendix, page 131). Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is clinically useful, it is now recognized that many of the broader categories, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, include several distinct entities, each of which may have its own unique epidemiological and etiologic profile. Consequently, it is difficult to present an all-encompassing overview of the epidemiology of lymphoma.Infection. Infection (other than HIV) may be an acquired cause of lymphoma (Tables 1.2 and 1.3).Infection is an acquired cause.Infection is a common cause of lymphoma in the USA, Europe and Australasia the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is approximately 20 per 100 000 of the population, with a slightly higher incidence in men than in women. This makes lymphoma the sixth or seventh most common cancer worldwide.Infection has been associated with a wide range of autoimmune conditions. For example, Sjögren syndrome (a autoimmune condition affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands) is associated with a 15-fold increased risk of developing salivary or lacrimal MALT lymphomas, and Hashimoto disease (an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid gland) predisposes to thyroid MALT lymphoma.Pesticide/herbicide exposure has been implicated in the etiology of NHL in numerous studies. Agents include organophosphates, phenoxyacetic acid herbicides and triazine herbicides. However, the results are inconsistent with wide variations in the estimates of risk. Presumably this is because most investigations have been case-control studies in which the estimation of risk is fraught with difficulty. It has long been recognized that certain forms of lymphoma have an increased incidence in certain parts of the world (Figure 1.1). This association is particularly striking for endemic Burkitt lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; however, similar associations are also well established for other subtypes. In the USA, the incidence of NHL is 50% higher in non-Hispanic white Americans than black Americans. However, in the UK, epidemiological data in epidemiological data in white, Asian and black populations indicate no significant variation in incidence by ethnicity.Infect"
9781908541963,chapter5,"Autoimmune liver diseases
Three liver diseases are categorized as autoimmune in etiology:
autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which targets the hepatocyte
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which affects the microscopic bile ducts
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which can involve any elements of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system.
AIH and PBC are predominantly autoimmune diseases, but the categorization is less clear-cut with PSC. The classic immunologic profiles associated with these conditions are shown in Table 5.1. Some diagnostic confusion can occur because of the existence of 'overlap syndromes' or histological progression from apparent AIH to either PBC or PSC.
Autoimmune hepatitis
AIH is a chronic inflammatory liver disease of at least 6 months' duration. The target cell for the immunologic response is the hepatocyte, and the dominant effector cells are lymphocytes and plasma cells. Two types of AIH are defined by classic autoantibody profiles:
type 1: anti-smooth-muscle antibodies with or without antinuclear factor
type 2: anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibodies.
These antibodies are associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, with a dominant elevation in the immunoglobulin (Ig) G fraction in untreated disease. Histological verification and staging of the disease is mandatory. The classic finding on liver histology is portal inflammation, with plasma cells and lymphocytes spilling over into the lobule in a pattern called interface hepatitis (Figure 5.1). Fibrosis or cirrhosis may be established by the time of presentation or may develop during follow-up despite apparently adequate therapy.
Clinical features. There is a strong gender association, with 70% of cases occurring in women. The age at presentation has a bimodal distribution, with peaks during the second decade and the fourth and fifth decades.
AIH can present as an acute hepatitis-like illness, with jaundice and a laboratory profile showing hyperbilirubinemia and a marked elevation in serum aminotransferases (transaminases). A liver biopsy will show the characteristic features, with or without fibrosis or cirrhosis. Alternatively, patients may present with established cirrhosis in the absence of any previous episode of jaundice or other symptoms alerting to the presence of chronic hepatitis. These patients may present with liver failure or complications of portal hypertension. As with all causes of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, but this risk is at the lower end of the spectrum in this condition.
Treatment. The standard treatment for AIH is immunosuppression with corticosteroids and azathioprine. Initial control is achieved with corticosteroids (exempli gratia prednisone, 30-60 mg/day). The dose is gradually reduced over 2-3 months to a target dose of 5-10 mg/day. Azathioprine is added as a steroid-sparing strategy and can be effective in maintaining remission, even after complete withdrawal of corticosteroids. Newer immunosuppressive drugs, such as mycophenolate and tacrolimus, are being used in refractory cases, but are not considered standard treatments for AIH.
The serum aminotransferases and IgG levels are used to monitor response to therapy. However, the intensity of necro-inflammatory activity may be understated by the serum aminotransferase levels, and repeat biopsy is recommended to confirm disease remission or if withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy is being considered. Flares in disease activity occur in patients on stable long-term therapy and after reductions in drug dose. These flares are treated in a similar way to newly diagnosed disease.
Liver transplantation is an effective therapy for advanced disease. AIH recurs in up to 40% of cases but is generally easily controlled by inclusion of a higher dose of corticosteroids in the maintenance immunosuppression regimen.
Primary biliary cirrhosis
PBC is a progressive disease with an asymptomatic phase that may last for 15-20 years. The asymptomatic phase is being increasingly recognized, however, with the detection of increased alkaline phosphatase levels on routine blood tests. The diagnosis is effectively established by the detection of positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), usually of the M2 subtype. The IgM fraction of the serum gammaglobulins is normally raised. The combination of elevated alkaline phosphatase, positive AMA and elevated IgM is now considered diagnostic of PBC; histological verification is no longer necessary. However, a liver biopsy may be of value in staging the severity of the disease.
Clinical features. The first symptoms are usually pruritus (itch) and lethargy (tiredness). The cause of the itch is unclear, but it responds in many cases to therapies that deplete bile salts (exempli gratia colestyramine [cholestyramine]). Antihistamines are not effective in this situation. The therapies used to treat the pruritus are listed in Table 5.2. The cause of the lethargy is also unclear, but there is increasing evidence to suggest that it is 'central' and secondary to changes within the brain. Hypothyroidism develops in up to 20% of patients with PBC, so it is important to screen regularly for this as a cause of the lethargy.
The development of jaundice indicates that the disease is entering the final stage, which lasts for 3-5 years.
The prolonged cholestasis leads to cholesterol deposition in the skin (xanthomas and xanthelasma) and osteopenia or osteoporosis (Figure 5.2). At this stage, patients may also exhibit signs of portal hypertension, with ascites and esophageal or gastric varices. Encephalopathy is less common than in other causes of end-stage chronic liver disease.
Treatment. There is no curative medical therapy for PBC. There is some evidence to support treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), as this improves the biochemical profile and possibly the histological appearance. There is, however, limited evidence that UDCA prolongs survival or delays the need for liver transplantation.
A number of other immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies have failed to demonstrate sufficient benefit to gain widespread use.
Liver transplantation is still the only effective treatment for advanced PBC. The indications for transplantation are liver failure, defined by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) as a disease severity score ranging from 4 to 40, typically above 20; severe and intractable pruritus; and hepatocellular carcinoma The results of liver transplantation for PBC are excellent. There is evidence that PBC recurs in the transplanted liver, but this phenomenon appears to be of little clinical relevance in the first 10-15 years after transplantation.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis
PSC can affect all elements of the biliary system.
Diagnosis. Cholangiography classically shows diffuse stricturing and beading involving both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. In some cases, the extrahepatic bile ducts are spared, which reduces the confidence in making the diagnosis on radiological criteria.
Liver histology may show the characteristic lesion of concentric fibrosis around the small bile ducts, termed 'onion-skin' fibrosis. The characteristic autoantibody is perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), but other autoantibodies may also be detected.
Clinical features. There is a strong association between PSC and inflammatory disease involving the large bowel - mainly ulcerative colitis but also Crohn's disease. About 75% of patients with PSC have inflammatory bowel disease and up to 7.5% of patients with ulcerative colitis have PSC. The diagnosis of PSC may be suggested by the detection of elevated cholestatic enzymes, particularly alkaline phosphatase, on routine screening of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. More advanced disease presents with jaundice and symptoms of biliary obstruction (dark urine, pale stools, itch) or low-grade cholangitis (fevers, sweats, feeling intermittently hot and cold).
Natural history. This is less predictable than that of PBC. Fluctuations in disease may:
settle spontaneously
respond to antibiotic therapy
respond to treatment with UDCA
improve after endoscopic dilation of a dominant stricture.
A rapid deterioration may indicate the development of a complicating cholangiocarcinoma. The risk of this malignant transformation is about 6-15% over the course of the disease. Screening for malignant transformation is not effective in detecting early disease, and progression to cholangiocarcinoma is generally regarded as a contraindication to liver transplantation.
Treatment. UDCA, 10-15 mg/kg/day, is recommended. This ameliorates pruritus, improves the liver biochemistry and histology and may alter the natural history of the disease. Immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies have not proved effective.
Liver transplantation is used widely for advanced disease. The indications for transplantation are less precise than they are in PBC, but persistent jaundice of more than 3 months' duration, in addition to evidence of liver failure or severe portal hypertension, are reasonable indications to proceed to liver transplantation. The results of liver transplantation are excellent in the absence of cholangiocarcinoma. PSC recurs in 8-15% of cases and is occasionally a cause of significant graft dysfunction.
Overlap syndromes
Diagnostic confusion may arise in some patients who manifest features of more than one autoimmune disease. Patients with early PBC may have florid interface hepatitis on liver biopsy, but this should not be confused with AIH. Other patients have features of AIH and a cholangiopathy, and these are considered to have an 'overlap syndrome' or autoimmune cholangiopathy. These patients are managed as if they had both diseases (id est with corticosteroids and UDCA).","<BULL> Autoimmune liver disease can target the hepatocyte or any element of the bile duct system. <BULL> Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is potentially treatable if diagnosed before the development of cirrhosis. <BULL> Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease, with a presymptomatic period of up to 20 years. <BULL> Liver transplantation is an excellent treatment for end-stage AIH and PBC. <BULL> Primary sclerosing cholangitis is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and is unpredictable; late disease can be managed effectively with liver transplantation unless complicated by cholangiocarcinoma.","iredness).

9781910797907,chp2,"Epidemiology and etiology
Despite being the best studied of the glycolytic enzyme disorders, gaps remain in our understanding of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. More than 600 cases of PK deficiency have been reported, mainly from Europe, the USA and Japan, but the disease occurs worldwide, and it is likely that many cases go unreported. This may be because affected individuals die before birth, or because cases are mild and do not require medical attention. Alternatively, some cases may not be properly recognized, or they may be misdiagnosed. Given that some cases may not present with any of the findings usually associated with the condition, there are likely to be more cases of PK deficiency than are published in the literature. Patient registries have now been developed for PK deficiency, which are helping to characterize the range of symptoms and complications arising from this disorder.
Prevalence of pyruvate kinase deficiency
PK deficiency occurs equally in men and women. A study in northern England observed a prevalence of 3.3 cases of PK deficiency per million in a mainly white population. Gene frequency studies have estimated the prevalence of PK deficiency in the general white population to be 51 cases per million. In Germany and the USA, it has been estimated that about 1% of the population are heterozygous for PK deficiency, while a study from Hong Kong found that 3% of newborn infants were heterozygous for a particular PK variant.
Because PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, individuals who are heterozygous for a single PK mutation will not show clinical signs of hemolysis or anemia. For this reason, prevalence estimates based on the observation of clinically affected patients will be substantially lower than those based on the prevalence of heterozygotes in a population.
The Amish community in Pennsylvania, USA, has a particularly high frequency of PK deficiency, associated with one specific mutation, which can be traced back to a single immigrant couple. An increased incidence has also been reported in children from a polygamist community in the western USA, again associated with a particular mutation.
Mutations associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency
As discussed in Chapter 1, mutations in the PKLR gene on chromosome 1 are responsible for PK deficiency. More than 300 different mutations have been reported; most are very rare, occurring only once. Currently, about 25% of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency appear to have a previously unrecorded mutation.
Although many of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are rare, a few are recorded more frequently (Table 2.1).
The variability in how PK deficiency manifests is thought to reflect the heterogeneity of these causative mutations, as well as the fact that most individuals with PK deficiency will be compound heterozygotes (id est they will have a different mutation in each copy of the PKLR gene).
Approximately 70% of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense (M) mutations (id est a single nucleotide change resulting in the production of a different amino acid), while the others are more disruptive non-missense (NM) mutations - either nonsense or insertional mutations, deletions (such as the deletion of exon 11 found in the Romany population), or splicing abnormalities (see pages 43 -).
Genotype-phenotype relationship. Current research is focusing on the relationship between specific mutations in the PKLR gene and the severity of hemolysis. Given the sheer number of different mutations and the predominance of compound heterozygotes, studies of the relationship between genotype and phenotype have grouped patients by type of mutation (id est two missense mutations [M/M], one missense and one non-missense mutation [M/NM], or two non-missense mutations [NM/NM]). Findings so far suggest that individuals with more disruptive (non-missense) mutations are more severely affected; they have lower levels of hemoglobin and require more frequent transfusions and a greater total transfusion volume. They also have a higher rate of splenectomy and a higher frequency of iron overload (see pages 43 -).
Acquired pyruvate kinase deficiency
While almost all cases of PK deficiency are inherited and result from mutations in the PKLR gene, an acquired form of the deficiency can very rarely occur secondarily to other blood diseases, such as acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory sideroblastic anemia. Acquired PK deficiency can also result from complications associated with chemotherapy.",<BULL> Gaps remain in our understanding of the epidemiology of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency because many cases are believed to go unreported. <BULL> About one quarter of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency will have a previously unrecorded mutation in the PKLR gene. <BULL> Approximately 70% of mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense mutations. <BULL> Some mutations are seen more frequently in specific regions and populations. <BULL> Acquired PK deficiency very rarely can occur secondarily to other blood diseases.,"Epidemiology and etiology of pyruvate kinase deficiency (PK) deficiency (Table 2.1)Despite being the best studied of the glycolytic enzyme disorders, gaps remain in our understanding of pyruvato-phosphate kinase (PK) deficiency.

9781908541666,ch_13,"Pregnancy and diabetes
Diabetic pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome for the fetus, but there is little excess mortality among diabetic women. Pregnancy may be complicated by type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and, increasingly, by type 2 diabetes. Occasionally, both types 1 and 2 may be diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy. Of all pregnancies in the USA, 3-10% are complicated by diabetes (90% are cases of GDM). Prevalence is higher in certain ethnic groups such as Asian, Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic groups. The fetal morbidity associated with diabetes is shown in Table 12.1.
There is a miscarriage rate of 9-14% among women with pre-existing diabetes. Higher rates are seen in those with very poor glycemic control. The risk of a structural anomaly in the fetus is four to eight times the rate in the normal population. The congenital malformation rate in diabetic pregnancy is 5.1-9.8%. Two-thirds of the birth defects affect the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, with neural tube defects being particularly common. The achievement of meticulous preconception glycemic control can reduce the incidence of malformation to near normal.
Diabetic pregnancy is linked with the development of large-for-gestational-age babies, but growth restriction in patients with pre-existing type 1 diabetes may also occur, particularly when the diabetes is associated with vascular complications. Fetal macrosomia (affecting 15-45% of babies born to diabetic women) is a frequent complication of diabetic pregnancy and increases the likelihood of birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus trauma. Perinatal mortality has fallen greatly in diabetic pregnancies but remains approximately twice that observed in non-diabetic pregnancies, with serious congenital malformations accounting for a large proportion of fetal loss.
Management of a diabetic pregnancy
Preconception. The management of existing diabetes must start in the preconception period. Preparation for conception must be discussed with women of childbearing age. The insulin regimen should be optimized to achieve a glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) below 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) without unacceptable hypoglycemia, although in practice this often proves difficult to achieve. Women should take folic acid, 5 mg daily, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.
After conception women should be seen as soon as possible in a combined diabetic/obstetric clinic with access to a dedicated diabetes physician, obstetrician, diabetes specialist nurse, dietitian and midwife. Blood glucose levels should be checked in the fasting state and 1 hour after each meal. Frequent visits are necessary to achieve target blood glucose values of 5.0-5.5 mmol/L (90-99 mg/dL) fasting and below 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) postprandially (fasting glucose targets recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence are 3.5-5.9 mmol/L [63-106 mg/dL). Dietary therapy should avoid single large meals and meals/food with a large percentage of simple carbohydrates.
Metformin can be continued throughout the pregnancy by a woman with type 2 diabetes, though most women will require additional insulin. Women with type 1 diabetes should be advised of an increased risk of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemic unawareness in the first trimester. The effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump therapy), particularly for those women who cannot achieve acceptable glucose control or experience troublesome hypoglycemia, is well established.
Cardiac anomaly scans should be offered at 20 weeks' gestation and scans to assess fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume at 28 weeks, 32 weeks and 36 weeks. Planning of the optimal timing and mode of delivery should be made prospectively.
Insulin-treated women are best managed by an insulin pump regimen during labor or Cesarean section.
Effect on complications. Pregnancy may be hazardous to women with pre-existing complications of diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy may deteriorate and women with diabetic nephropathy may experience a decline in renal function and an increase in proteinuria. A successful outcome of pregnancy is unlikely when the serum creatinine exceeds 250 µmol/L. Close monitoring is mandatory, with retinal assessment at 16 weeks in those with type 1 diabetes and signs of retinopathy at the first antenatal appointment. Hypertension and pre-eclampsia are more common in diabetic mothers.
Gestational diabetes mellitus
GDM is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Previously there were no uniformly accepted international standards for the diagnosis of GDM. New evidence has emerged to change practice. The large multinational Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study has demonstrated a linear relationship between maternal hyperglycemia and birth weight, with no apparent threshold effect between maternal glycemia and pregnancy outcome. The Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study in Pregnant Women (ACHOIS) has established that treatment of GDM with insulin improves pregnancy outcomes (such as birth weight, macrosomia and shoulder dystocia). The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has attempted to achieve an international consensus on screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes. It recommends a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all women who are not known to be diabetic at 24-28 weeks. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed when one or more threshold values are exceeded (fasting >= 5.1 mmol/L [92 mg/dL), 1-hour >= 10.0 mmol/L [180 mg/dL], 2-hour >= 8.5 mmol/L [153 mg/dL]). Other guidelines (for example, those from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN]) advocate a more selective approach to screening on the basis of risk factors (for example, obesity, a first-degree relative with diabetes, ethnicity, advanced maternal age, previous GDM and a previous macrosomic baby).
Women should be screened for risk factors at booking. In the USA, a two-step approach has been recommended: a 50 g 1-hour glucose challenge being performed at 26-28 weeks followed by a 100 g 3-hour OGTT for those with an abnormal result in the first test. For high-risk women, a one-step approach could be used by proceeding directly to the 100 g 3-hour OGTT. However, at present, the American Diabetes Association is planning to consider adoption of the IADPSG diagnostic criteria. Those with previous GDM should start early self-monitoring of blood glucose or have a 2-hour 75 g OGTT at 16-18 weeks followed by a repeat OGTT at 28 weeks if the first test is normal. In the presence of other risk factors, an OGTT should be undertaken at 24-28 weeks. GDM usually appears after the middle of the second trimester and much of the perinatal morbidity in GDM is associated with the delivery of a large-for-gestational-age baby. The risks associated with GDM are listed in Table 12.2.
Management. Scans to determine fetal growth and abdominal circumference help inform decisions about the need for intensive blood glucose control in GDM. The diagnosis of GDM confers the need to detect maternal hyperglycemia by intensive self-monitoring of blood glucose, preferably by postprandial testing.
All women should receive dietary advice from a dietitian and be encouraged to take physical exercise. Weight loss is recommended for women with a body mass index (BMI) above 27 kg/m.
Pharmacological treatment is recommended when fasting blood glucose values exceed 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or 2-hour postprandial glucose values exceed 6.7 mmol/L (120 mg/dL). Metformin is now considered acceptable in the treatment of GDM, though it is still not widely used. When glucose targets are not met, and particularly when fetal ultrasound shows incipient fetal macrosomia, insulin therapy should be started. Recent evidence suggests that glibenclamide may also be useful in the treatment of GDM.
Advising women. Women with GDM need to be informed that the condition confers an increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes and should be strongly advised to reduce this risk postnatally by reducing weight and taking regular exercise. Fasting plasma glucose should be checked at the 6-week postnatal appointment and annually thereafter to check whether the woman has progressed to type 2 diabetes.
Neonatal checks
Neonatal care involves the detection of hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress, polycythemia and other complications consequent to maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy.

Other guidelines (for example, those from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN]) advocate a more selective approach to screening on the basis of risk factors (for example, obesity, a first-degree relative with diabetes, ethnicity, advanced maternal age, previous GDM and a previous macrosomic baby). In the USA, there is a high prevalence of gestational diabetes in women with pre-existing diabetes. In the USA, a two-step approach has been recommended: a 50 g 1-hour glucose challenge being performed at 26-28 weeks followed by a 100 g 3-hour OGTT for those with an abnormal result in the first test. The congenital malformation rate in diabetic pregnancy is 5.1-9.8%. Two-thirds of the birth defects affect the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, with neural tube defects being particularly common. The achievement of meticulous preconception glycemic control can reduce the incidence of malformation to near normal.Diabetic pregnancy is linked with the development of large-for-gestational-age babies, but growth restriction in patients with pre-existing type 1 diabetes may also occur, particularly when the diabetes is associated with vascular complications. Fetal macrosomia (affecting 15-45% of babies born to diabetic women) is a frequent complication of diabetic pregnancy and increases the likelihood of birth injuries such as hip dystocia and brachial plexus trauma. Perinatal mortality has fallen greatly in diabetic pregnancies but remains approximately twice that observed in non-diabetic pregnancies, with serious congenital malformations accounting for a large proportion of fetal loss.Di"
9781912776153,chp3,"Syncope is a significant healthcare problem, resulting in the need for clinical evaluation, whether acutely in the emergency room or later in the physician's office. On the one hand, syncope can be benign, such as vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope, but on the other, it can be serious with a potentially fatal outcome, such as ventricular arrhythmias or heart block. In all of these situations, syncope is usually of considerable concern to the patient and may result in sequelae such as injury, restriction of driving, or even death.
What is syncope?
Cerebral blood flow depends on maintenance of blood pressure, which in turn is directly related to both cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance such that a drop in either may be associated with a fall or presyncope.
Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness), and presyncope is defined as a sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness but do not actually do so). Patients often use the term 'dizzy spell', which covers a multitude of etiologies, including vertigo and postural symptoms; a detailed history of what the patient actually feels is mandatory.
Features that may help to clarify if blackout has a cardiac cause are detailed in Table 3.1. There may be a short prodromal phase of sweating, dizziness or a sensation of fainting, often lasting less than 30 seconds.
Although many patients are briefly disorientated on regaining consciousness, recovery is rapid and complete within a short period (usually minutes). It is unusual to have a prolonged period of unconsciousness (more than 5 minutes) with a cardiac cause, although witness description is notoriously unreliable. Patients are usually lucid quickly after an episode. Tonic-clonic seizure, although uncommon, can occur because of cerebral anoxia and does not exclude a cardiac cause. Urinary incontinence is rare. The desire to sleep afterwards is also uncommon. Syncope is much more common than epilepsy.
Recurrent presyncope (the sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness) is common and may culminate in syncope over time. Presyncope occurs commonly in situations where the native cardiac pacemaker is impaired but not for long enough to produce syncope (exempli gratia sick sinus syndrome or carotid sinus hypersensitivity). Self-injury is variable. In some cases, symptoms may occur over many years before a diagnosis is made. In many cases, specific precipitating factors are uncommon. Presyncope needs to be differentiated from dizziness, which can include vertigo.
Syncope in patients with known structural heart disease, particularly impaired left ventricular (LV) function, carries a significantly worse prognosis with an increased risk of sudden death. Syncope may be due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or intermittent advanced heart block. These patients require urgent cardiological investigation.
The differential diagnoses for the causes of falls and blackouts are shown in Table 3.3. Patients with cardiac syncope often do not remember the loss of consciousness and therefore only consider that they have had a fall. However, instances of sudden unheralded blackout without prodromal symptoms and with brief loss of consciousness are almost certainly cardiac in origin. Further investigations will help to ascertain whether the blackout has a cardiac cause.
Clinical history. The clinical history remains of critical importance. The patient, and others present at the time of the syncope, can provide important details about the circumstances of the syncope. The following aspects should be reviewed and obtained prior to initiating a work-up:
the time of day of the syncope
whether syncope occurred at rest or during exertion
whether syncope occurred following micturition
whether the patient had any symptoms preceding the syncope, such as palpitations, dizziness, sweating, or an aura
whether the fainting episode occurred suddenly or gradually
whether the patient injured themselves at the time of syncope.
Non-invasive testing. Cardiac monitoring at the time of syncope remains critical to exclude or confirm a cardiac arrhythmia. However, in the majority of circumstances there was no monitoring of the rhythm at the time of syncope, and there are no tracings available to review. Thus, the work-up of the patient who has had an episode of syncope is initially directed at determining if there are any cardiac abnormalities. On physical examination, the heart sounds and presence of murmurs could alert the physician to valvular abnormalities such as aortic stenosis or hypertrophic myopathy, or physical signs of congestive heart failure could suggest LV dysfunction. A 2D echocardiogram and, in specific circumstances, a treadmill exercise test should be performed. Myocardial ischemia may be ruled out by the latter or by nuclear imaging. Most important of all, however, is that planning for ambulatory monitoring is essential: for 24-48 hours with Holter monitors; or up to 14 days with loop monitors; or even using implantable monitors that provide up to 36 months of continuous recordings of heart rhythm. The positive yield of monitoring will depend upon the frequency of syncopal episodes. If symptoms are infrequent, Holter monitoring for 24-48 hours will provide a very low yield and it is sometimes more cost-effective to consider an implantable loop recorder first. Newer smartphone and smartwatch applications will ultimately provide new means for patients to record their heart rhythm at nearly all times.
Tilt-testing is now infrequently performed in the evaluation of syncope, and is mostly performed in centers evaluating patients with profound autonomic causes of syncope. Neurological work-up and evaluation may also be required in selected cases. Metabolic causes, such as hypoglycemia, hypoxia or even Addison's disease, may require specific laboratory work-up.
Syncope associated with advanced heart block requires permanent pacing, and remains a worldwide daily presentation in the physician's office or in the emergency room. If the electrocardiogram is normal, but a transient episode of high grade atrioventricular block has been diagnosed on cardiac monitoring, permanent pacing will be planned. If an atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been documented, treatment directed at the underlying arrhythmia will be performed, such as catheter ablation or defibrillator implantation.
In non-arrhythmia causes of syncope, such as aortic stenosis or a rare mitral valve tumor, targeted valvular heart disease treatment will be obtained. For patients with neurological causes of syncope, whether vascular or due to a seizure, the neurologist will plan for appropriate treatment.
In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, id est the common faint or vasovagal syncope, a frequent clinical problem, treatment and prevention of syncope can be challenging and frustrating. Episodes do not always occur in predictable circumstances, and, in the elderly in particular, concerns about injury are serious. Maintaining proper hydration and, in some cases, the use of elastic stockings to favor blood return to the heart is important. Salt loading orally and, sometimes, specific muscle exercises to increase core muscle tone are beneficial.
Nowadays, permanent pacing is performed infrequently but still has a therapeutic role in subsets of patients with syncope.
Pharmacological approaches include the use of drugs to treat hypotension, such as midrodine directed at vasodepressor syncope or anticholinergic agents directed at cardioinhibitory syncope. Beta-blockers have been tried in the past, but recent trials have not shown a convincing benefit as far as suppression of syncope is concerned. There have been reports of performing cardiac ablation of ganglionated plexuses in these patients to avoid permanent pacing and reduce or eliminate recurrent episodes of syncope by reducing cholinergic tone.
Who should be referred?
Table 3.4 details which patients should be referred and how urgently.
What should the consulting physician do?
Take a detailed history of the circumstances of the episode from the patient and, if possible, from a witness.
Determine whether there were prodromal symptoms such as nausea, sweating or lightheadedness suggestive of vagally mediated syncope.
Determine whether there are any associated cardiac abnormalities.
Take the blood pressure with the patient lying and standing (after 2 minutes of upright posture), if indicated.
Perform a 12-lead resting electrocardiogram.","<BULL> Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness or TLoC). <BULL> Syncope can be benign, such as vasovagal (neurocardiogenic), although it may still be disabling for some patients with recurrent fainting spells.

9781908541468,ch_14,"Renal replacement therapy and transplantation
Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD):
conservative care and symptom control
dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis)
kidney transplant (from a living or cadaveric donor).
In general, all patients should be offered all suitable choices, and be fully counseled as to the advantages and disadvantages of each. In reality, however, not all options are available in all centers, and patient-related factors can be limiting.
Conservative care
Dialysis may not improve quality of life in patients with extensive comorbidities. Indeed, there is some evidence that very elderly patients, with only limited comorbid illnesses, may not even have the length of their lives prolonged by dialysis. In these circumstances, many patients opt for symptom control without dialysis, using erythropoietin, vitamin D analogs, dietary control, antipruritics and antiemetics as necessary. Such patients often have significantly better quality of life, fewer hospital admissions (exempli gratia from dialysis-related complications), and are more likely to die finally at home rather than in hospital than patients receiving dialysis.
Conservative care does not represent an absence of renal support, but rather the active medical (non-technological) management of the complications of kidney failure. It is clearly important that patients participate fully in these discussions wherever possible. A multidisciplinary team approach is crucial and should involve nurses, doctors, counselors and family members.
The term dialysis refers to the physical process of the diffusion of a molecule down its concentration gradient, from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration, through a semipermeable membrane.
Hemodialysis involves pumping blood from the body through an artificial kidney in which the blood is surrounded by a solution of electrolytes, called the dialysate, the concentration of which can be varied precisely. Solutes present in the blood at high concentration (exempli gratia urea, potassium, creatinine) diffuse into the dialysate and are removed (Figure 12.1).
Changing the concentration of solutes in the dialysate can alter the electrolyte composition of the blood. Raising the dialysate calcium above the serum concentration, for example, can increase serum calcium in patients with hypocalcemia.
A separate biophysical process, ultrafiltration, is used to regulate the distribution of water between the blood and dialysate. The volume of water to be removed from the patient's blood can be controlled by altering the pressures on either side of the membrane separating the blood from the dialysate.
The dialysis machine itself is simply the housing for the pumps controlling blood and dialysate flow, various safety devices (pressure sensors, air detectors), a system for maintaining blood anticoagulation in the extracorporeal circuit (usually a heparin infusion), and a screen for graphically displaying the various parameters monitored. Different modalities of dialysis differ in the precise balance of ultrafiltration and dialysis, the speed of blood flow and the nature of the dialysate.
Patients need excellent vascular access, and access problems are a major cause of morbidity (Table 12.1). Access is obtained through either a fistula created between a peripheral artery and vein (usually radial or brachial), or a permanent plastic catheter inserted into an internal jugular or subclavian vein (Figure 12.2).
Hemodialysis can be carried out in a main hospital center, a satellite unit (often staffed only by nurses) or in the patient's home. Home hemodialysis offers patients the most autonomy, but requires a suitable house with a water supply, space (for the machine and supplies), a reasonably technically competent patient and usually a trained helper who will be present during each dialysis session. Patients dialysing at home often have the best quality of life. Dialysis is usually performed three times each week for about 4 hours. Some patients opt for daily hemodialysis (usually 6 days/week), which provides the best control of fluid balance and biochemistry, but is intensive. Patients can dialyse overnight while they sleep either at home or in dialysis centers. It is difficult to determine the optimum amount of dialysis a patient requires, and various methods are in use.
Peritoneal dialysis uses the peritoneal cavity as a reservoir into which a dialysate can be infused, and the blood flowing through peritoneal capillaries as the blood source. Dialysis and ultrafiltration occur across these capillaries. Ultrafiltration is controlled by altering the osmolality of the dialysate solution and thus drawing water out of the patient's blood. This can be achieved with glucose or other large-molecular-weight solutes in the dialysate. The glucose load can cause problems of its own, such as poor diabetic control and weight gain.
Dialysate is infused through a catheter, which is inserted into the patient's peritoneum under local or general anesthetic and remains in place permanently. The waste solutes are removed by exchanging the peritoneal fluid for a fresh solution (Figure 12.3). As long as patients have reasonable manual dexterity, they can be trained to perform continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, typically four exchanges spaced throughout the day with each one taking about 20 minutes, or to use a machine (automated peritoneal dialysis) to do a number of exchanges overnight while they sleep, and then perform only one or two daytime exchanges.
Peritoneal dialysis is carried out by the patient at home, at work or while on holiday. It therefore allows the patient a high degree of independence and control over their own illness. However, patients must not be allowed to become isolated, and still need considerable support.
Intra-abdominal adhesions and abdominal wall stoma are absolute contraindications for peritoneal dialysis, and obesity, intestinal disease, respiratory disease and hernias are relative contraindications. The complications of peritoneal dialysis are listed in Table 12.2.
When to start dialysis. The question of when to start dialysis remains controversial. In general, patients should begin dialysis when estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is in the range of 8-10 mL/minute/1.73m. There is no good evidence that starting dialysis earlier is of any benefit to patients. If dialysis is delayed for too long, however, patients can become very malnourished. Nevertheless, there are excellent data suggesting that earlier referral for nephrological care before renal replacement therapy is required can significantly delay the need for dialysis, and reduce early morbidity and mortality.
Dialysis and pregnancy. Most women with ESKD on dialysis are infertile, and pregnancy is extremely uncommon. Fertility often returns rapidly after a successful kidney transplant (see below). If women on dialysis do become pregnant, the outcome is usually poor with a very high risk of miscarriage, severe hypertension, small babies and prematurity. Only 47% of women have a successful obstetric outcome.
A kidney transplant provides the best long-term outcome for patients with ESKD. A transplant can come from a cadaveric donor, from a living relative or from an unrelated living donor (often called emotionally related). The sale of organs for transplantation is prohibited in almost all countries, but nevertheless continues, mostly because of the severe shortage of organs. All patients with ESKD should be considered for a transplant. Age itself is not a major determinant of outcome, though the presence of comorbid disease adversely affects survival (Table 12.3).
Patients should be aware of the risks and benefits of transplantation (Table 12.4), and require screening for occult cardiovascular disease before surgery. Over 90% of transplants should be working 1 year after surgery. A cadaveric transplant should have a mean survival of 15 years and a living transplant about 18-20 years.
Patients do not generally have their native kidneys removed, and the transplanted kidney is placed extraperitoneally in the iliac fossa. Patients can usually expect to stay in hospital for 1-3 weeks, and require frequent follow-up after discharge (two or three times each week initially).
Patients will be treated with a cocktail of immunosuppressant drugs, which may include ciclosporin, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, sirolimus or prednisolone. These drugs must be taken for life and require careful monitoring (Table 12.5). Patients will also have received potent immunosuppression at the time of surgery, including monoclonal antibodies against the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor or T lymphocytes, or antithymocyte globulin.
Common complications. Routine postoperative problems, such as deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, can occur. Specific problems include opportunistic infections (viral, fungal, bacterial), malignancies (especially skin cancers), drug toxicity, recurrence of the original disease in the transplant, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia and graft failure (Table 12.6). Patients should be followed up for life and undergo annual screening for cancers, drug toxicity and cardiovascular disease in addition to routine clinic visits. Most patients with a transplant will die from cardiovascular disease, which should, therefore, be aggressively managed.
Fertility is usually restored in women after a kidney transplant, but transplant recipients have a high risk of hypertension during pregnancy, and an increased risk of miscarriage in the first trimester and premature delivery. Some immunosuppressants (exempli gratia mycophenolate mofetil) also pose a risk to the fetus.","<BULL> Not all patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) need or want dialysis, and some may be managed conservatively. <BULL> Most patients will require several modalities of renal replacement therapy in their lifetime. <BULL> Hemodialysis requires excellent vascular access; problems with access cause significant morbidity. <BULL> Peritoneal dialysis is an excellent modality for many patients, especially early in ESKD. <BULL> Transplantation offers the best long-term outcomes, but at the expense of long-term side effects from immunosuppression, including cancers and cardiovascular disease. <BULL> Most women on dialysis are infertile.

9781910797662,ch09,"Future trends
The mortality and morbidity of bladder cancer could be reduced in several ways:
improving prevention
earlier diagnosis
better treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease
improved use of existing therapies
identification of biomarkers that allow better risk stratification and selection of treatment
development of new therapies and rational combinations
better involvement of palliative and supportive care.
Improving prevention
Smoking remains by far the most important contributor to the burden of bladder cancer around the world (see page 9). In fact, the link between smoking and bladder cancer is stronger than the link with lung cancer but is less well understood by the general population. Smoking is also the factor most amenable to modification through changes to individual behavior and public health measures. This requires changes to societal norms to make smoking an unacceptable behavior. Health authorities in many countries are introducing legislation that restricts where people can smoke, and programs that aim to reduce the uptake of smoking, particularly in younger people, and assisting smokers to quit. For example, in the UK smoking rates among young adults decreased from 26% in 2010 to 19% in 2016, and the number of adult smokers decreased from 17.2% in 2015 to 15.8% in 2016.
Consideration must also be given to reducing incidental or sidestream (passive) exposure to smoke, particularly for those who cannot choose to avoid it, such as children, and workers in the hospitality industries. Legislation to ban smoking in public places and in the presence of children is being implemented in many countries. These measures will address numerous other health issues and are an extremely logical use of public healthcare expenditure.
Occupational exposure to carcinogens is now uncommon. Schistosomiasis remains a significant factor in bladder carcinogenesis in certain regions, although rates have fallen significantly over the last 25 years as measures to control schistosomiasis have been implemented.
Earlier diagnosis
Bladder cancer is often a 'forgotten' cancer in the community, even though it is reported to be the most expensive cancer from diagnosis to death overall, accounting for substantial healthcare costs and resource use.
As discussed in the 'Clinical Presentation' chapter, a key problem is that symptoms may be overlooked or ignored by the patient and physician, increasing the probability of disease being advanced at diagnosis. For example, a survey of more than 9600 people in five European countries found that 62% did not know the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer. Improved public awareness of the symptoms of bladder cancer is therefore needed to allow earlier detection, when cure may be possible. One example is the 'blood in your pee' public awareness advertising in the UK (part of a larger 'Be clear on cancer' campaign by the National Health Service) and in Australia. It is also important that clinicians understand the importance of following up any incidence of hematuria (see page 27).
Current diagnostic modalities are invasive (cystoscopy) or have suboptimal sensitivity and/or specificity (urine cytology or other urine-based diagnostics) or are too costly for routine use. Innovative models such as 'one stop' clinics for evaluation of hematuria and performance of cystoscopy may improve outcomes (see page 31).
Tests for tumor markers that may reduce the use of cystoscopy are being explored (see page 33-35).
Better treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease
Most non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is low or intermediate risk (low-grade Ta), can be managed endoscopically and requires only limited further assessment or treatment. High-risk disease (all Ta, T1, high-grade carcinoma in situ [CIS], or large volume Ta) is less common but accounts for the majority of health resources in this therapy area, in managing the initial disease and reducing the risk of recurrence or progression to more advanced or metastatic disease. Newer surgical and other ablative techniques, and enhanced endoscopic imaging with fluorescence cystoscopy, optical coherence tomography and confocal laser, may improve diagnostic risk stratification and the definitive treatment of early disease. Standardization of protocols for adjunctive therapies such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment will also reduce the number of non-muscle-invasive cancers that progress to fatal invasive cancers. Hayne and colleagues have summarized the current status of several relevant trials with BCG.
Advances in the near future will probably include systemic immunotherapy, if these treatments are shown to improve control or cure and reduce recurrence and progression, with an acceptable safety profile and cost-effectiveness. Treatment is also likely to be stratified according to molecular and genomic profiling of the tumor rather than conventional light microscopic appearance. More accurate imaging modalities may allow better detection and management of residual or micrometastatic disease, with consequent improvements in the stratification of patients into more appropriate treatment pathways.
Improved use of existing therapies
This has been the main focus of work to date, and considerable progress has been made across all stages of bladder cancer. Two surgical trials testing the potential benefit of extended pelvic and iliac lymphadenectomy at the time of radical cystectomy will define the optimal anatomic limits of this surgery., Radiation therapy can be administered more safely at higher doses and with fewer side effects. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can now be safely delivered to many patients and previous definitions of cisplatin-ineligibility have been relaxed. These changes mean that treatment can be given more safely, at more effective doses, for the planned duration, and to a broader range of patients. Many patients now have excellent outcomes with established treatments such as systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and further improvements could be realized through more widespread use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for suitable patients.
Future advances in this area will be based on:
better understanding of the biology of bladder cancer and consequent treatment selection, such as the identification of biomarkers that reliably predict who should receive immunotherapy instead of chemotherapy and markers that would point to a higher probability of response in subsequent lines of therapy
high-level evidence of meaningful clinical benefit, particularly improved survival and quality of life, which have yet to be reported from early trials of immunotherapies
rational combinations of existing therapy, such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy, or integration of small-molecule kinase inhibitors, possibly in selected patients based on characterization of tumor biology
use of active therapies at earlier stages in the treatment pathways
better access to therapies, particularly in low- or middle-income countries.
Identification of biomarkers that allow better risk stratification and treatment selection
Several relevant biomarkers for risk stratification and prediction of response to treatment of bladder cancer are being explored (exempli gratia FGFR, VEGFR, HER2, circulating tumor DNA) and some (exempli gratia PD-L1) are beginning to be used in clinical practice in the hope that this might increase the probability that patients receiving treatments aimed at such targets will respond to them; however, uptake of such assays remains limited on a global scale and it is not yet clear whether their use improves outcomes. Improvements in the specificity and sensitivity of assays are required before these approaches are used in routine practice.
Better technology in this arena, including tests that are less invasive than cystoscopy or biopsy and therefore more acceptable to patients, will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and reduction of costs. Future developments are likely to involve refinements based on rational assessment of the tumor biology based on genomic, proteomic or immunologic profiling. However, incorporation of these assays into clinical practice requires care, particularly if the tissue was not obtained recently (exempli gratia past cystectomy) or is not representative of the cancer (exempli gratia small endoscopic biopsy of a bladder tumor in a patient with widespread metastatic disease). We will do well to learn from experience with the PD-L1 assays and the effects that blind faith in an unproven biomarker can have on clinical trial outcomes and drug development, as seen in the IMvigor 211 trial of atezolizumab (see page 77).
Development of new therapies and rational combinations
There is considerable interest in the outcomes with new drugs, drug classes and combinations, which show great promise and are likely to transform clinical practice after many years with no major improvements. Advances in our understanding of the biology of the complex conditions known as 'bladder cancer' will enable identification of more potential options for treatment. Rational targets for treatment can be identified, lessons learned from other malignancies, and treatments used in other malignancies may be logically evaluated in bladder cancer and existing treatments used more effectively.
The number of potential permutations and combinations of existing and future therapies is daunting, and becomes even more challenging when the various stages of bladder cancer are considered, and the ways in which initial treatment selection may affect subsequent sequencing of treatments. For example, if high-risk non-muscle-invasive disease relapses after systemic immunotherapy, should the patient then receive similar therapy for metastatic disease? If so, when? Would treatment with radiation or chemotherapy modify the probability of a subsequent response to such therapy? Can the initial therapy be modified in some way, such as use in combination with radiation or another ablative technique to prime the immune system so that subsequent immunotherapy is more effective? These and similar questions are hot topics at present, and many clinical trials are planned or underway.
Clinical research must be based on understanding of the clinical imperative to provide benefit to the patient throughout their entire treatment journey, rather than traditional drug development strategies, and it is insufficient to show activity or benefit from one treatment at one stage of the disease. We must understand how and when such treatments should be integrated into the overall treatment course in order to achieve best outcomes for our patients.
The collection of data and samples for future research is also important. Enormous amounts of data are collected as part of routine clinical care but are not available for research or data linkage. For example, clinical samples used for diagnostic purposes are not made available for research. Our patients expect that this sort of work is being done and are often surprised to find it is not. One simple approach would be an opt-in process whereby patients consent to clinical information collected in the context of routine care, and tissue samples surplus to diagnostic requirements, being made available for future research.
Better involvement of palliative and supportive care
Most of the progress in bladder cancer management in the last 20 years has been in supportive care. This relates to improvement in quality of life through better control of symptoms, reduction in treatment-related toxicity, improved management of comorbidities and involvement of other disciplines such as exercise physiology, where improvements in cancer-specific outcomes can also be shown. There is a risk that quality of life is sacrificed by favoring treatments that have good efficacy but might be toxic. Whilst this is understandable, our patients often tell us that quality of life is more important than extending survival. It is important to recognize this, and to remember when considering the choice of treatment in the setting of incurable cancer, that improvement, or at least maintenance, of quality of life and functioning is a paramount objective. It is heartening to see this growing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes. A further benefit from this approach is the focus on reducing and managing the toxicities of treatment, with consequent improvements in response (and potentially cure) rates as well.
Future developments in this area are likely to include:

The first drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease, in the 1860s, were the belladonna alkaloids. These were replaced by the synthetic anticholinergic drugs benzhexol and benztropine in the 1940s, although pharmacological treatment has been the mainstay of Parkinson's disease management since the 1920s when researchers were focused on the development of a vaccine that would prevent postencephalitic parkinsonism. In 1957, Dr Arvid Carlsson demonstrated that dopamine was a neurotransmitter in the brain and not just a precursor of norepinephrine, as was the prevailing view at that time. He went on to show that L-dopa, a precursor of dopamine, effectively treated the symptoms of Parkinsonism. In 2000, he was awarded the Nobel prize for the first description of levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease. During the 1960s, Birkmayer and Hornykiewicz, Barbeau et al. and Cotzias et al. demonstrated the dramatic clinical effects of high-dose oral levodopa therapy, revolutionizing the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine and restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells. It has improved the quality of patients' lives substantially, and appears to have led to a reduction in mortality. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylation in the brain (Figure 4.1), but this can also occur outside the blood-brain barrier, leading to side effects such as nausea and postural hypotension. The addition of a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, such as carbidopa or benserazide, inhibits dopa decarboxylase in the rest of the body and reduces side effects. The bioavailability of levodopa has been enhanced further by the emergence of drugs such as tolcapone and entacapone, which inhibit catechol- O -methyl transferase (COMT), the enzyme principally responsible for the breakdown of dopamine.
Expected response. Patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately, although in some cases a delayed effect is seen after prolonged treatment. The beneficial response to levodopa can often be assessed after a single test dose. However, there may be significant false-positive results, given that patients with Parkinson-plus syndromes such as multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may also respond to levodopa initially. In addition, the test does not allow for the delayed positive 'long-duration' effect of levodopa. In resistant cases, the maximum tolerated dose (up to 2 g/day) should be tried for at least 1 month before the patient is declared unresponsive.
Administration. Levodopa therapy should be started at the minimal effective dose (usually 50-100 mg/day), in combination with a decarboxylase inhibitor, given three times daily.
Is levodopa toxic? Results of experiments with cultured dopaminergic neurons and with rats previously suggested that levodopa may be toxic to dopamine neurons; it was postulated that levodopa is converted to toxic dopamine metabolites, which cause damage by the production of free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide. The substantia nigra was thought to be at risk because it contains high concentrations of catalysts, such as iron, for free-radical production, and low concentrations of free-radical scavengers. These concerns gave rise to 'levodopa phobia' in many patients, denying them the benefit of levodopa treatment.
However, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. A postmortem study of 5 patients with essential tremor, who were mistakenly given sustained levodopa therapy, found no evidence of damage to nigral cells. In addition, patients who receive long-term levodopa for restless legs syndrome show no evidence of damage to the substantia nigra at autopsy. These findings should reassure patients receiving long-term levodopa.
Levodopa dyskinesia. Chronic therapy with levodopa, however, results in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias due to Parkinson's disease progression coupled with the short half-life of levodopa. The ELLDOPA study (see below) in patients with early Parkinson's disease suggests that a higher dosage of levodopa leads to a higher frequency of dyskinesia. The development of dyskinesias has been shown to adversely affect patients' and carers' quality of life, and to at least double the cost of care. In order to prevent/delay dyskinesia, several trials have examined initiating treatment with a dopamine agonist such as ropinirole, pramipexole, cabergoline or pergolide. Many trials have compared these dopamine agonists with levodopa in previously untreated patients over a 4-5 year period.
Caution is necessary when comparing results, owing to differences in the methods used, but all the studies have suggested that up to 50% fewer dyskinesias developed in those treated with a dopamine agonist rather than levodopa, which can be reserved for use when the effects of the dopamine agonist wear off.
The ELLDOPA study (Early versus Late LevoDOPA in Parkinson's disease) evaluated previously untreated patients randomized to three doses (150, 300 or 600 mg) of levodopa or placebo. Levodopa-treated patients showed a significant improvement in motor scores at all three doses compared with those receiving placebo. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging suggested an increased rate of decline of striatal I-beta-CIT uptake in the levodopa-treated arm compared with placebo. This anomalous observation further deepens the confusion surrounding the use of imaging findings as surrogate markers, the link between imaging findings and clinical outcome, and whether in-vivo neuroprotection trials can really be performed.
Side effects, such as lightheadedness or nausea, may be relieved by taking medication with food or increasing the dose of decarboxylase inhibitor. Side effects usually settle but, if persistent, can be prevented by using a peripheral dopamine antagonist such as domperidone. Some complications may, however, persist in the long term (Table 4.1).
Levodopa formulations
Controlled-release preparations of levodopa, 200 mg or 100 mg, have no significant advantages over immediate-release preparations apart from their use in treating nocturnal disabilities. Such preparations have reduced bioavailability, and many patients dislike the longer lead time before improvement. Combining controlled-release and shorter-acting preparations is not advisable because the effect is difficult to predict.
Addition of a catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor such as entacapone to the traditional combination of levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor (carbidopa) is now licensed for the treatment of later-stage Parkinson's disease that is no longer stabilized on a levodopa/decarboxylase preparation.
The STRIDE-PD study was a prospective 134-week double-blind trial comparing the risk of developing dyskinesias in 747 Parkinson's disease patients randomized to either levodopa and carbidopa (LC) or levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone (LCE), administered four times daily at 3.5-hour intervals. LCE had a shorter time to onset and increased frequency of dyskinesia at week 134 (42% vs 32%; p < 0.02) than LC. The time to wearing off and motor scores were not significantly different, although there was a trend in favor of LCE.
Although the mean levodopa dose was comparable in the two groups, the LCE group had a 30% greater exposure to levodopa based on the pharmacokinetic effect of entacapone, which increases the plasma levodopa by 30%. LCE caused a significant increase in dyskinesia in patients who were taking dopamine agonists, but not in patients who were not taking dopamine agonists. Surprisingly, there was an increase in prostate cancer and myocardial infarctions in the LCE group. At present, LCE cannot be recommended as the initial levodopa formulation.
Intraduodenal/jejunal infusion of levodopa offers an alternative route of administration in very advanced Parkinson's disease when other treatments have failed, and in patients not suitable for deep brain stimulation (see Table 5.3) or apomorphine (see pages 73 -). Using a portable infusion pump the enteral gel is delivered continuously through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube into the duodenum, where it is absorbed and produces a steady plasma level. Studies have shown that this infusion is effective in controlling motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease and reduces dyskinesias. It also enables the patient to discontinue oral dopaminergic treatment and apomorphine infusion. It is licensed in several countries as an 'orphan' drug.
Several other trials using intrajejunal levodopa are in progress or have been completed. These include the GLORIA and MONOTREAT studies (completed), and the DUOGLOBE (addressing non-motor symptoms, specifically sleep) and INSIGHTS studies (in progress).
Carbidopa/levodopa extended release. A novel extended-release capsule formulation of carbidopa and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio (ER CD-LD, formerly known as IPX066), containing intermediate- and extended-release beads, has recently been licensed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The drug's enhanced pharmacokinetic profile offers reliable control of motor symptoms, including the reduction of 'off time' throughout the day. Three studies have investigated the efficacy of this formulation in patients with Parkinson's disease (see below); however, no sleep benefit has been found, and the long-term consequences of this dosing with levodopa is unknown.
The APEX-PD study, a phase 3 randomized double-blind fixed-dose placebo-controlled trial, investigated the safety and efficacy of ER CD-LD in levodopa-naïve patients with early Parkinson's disease. Patients were randomized to one of four treatments for 30 weeks: placebo or ER CD-LD, 145 mg, 245 mg or 390 mg, three times daily. All dosages were superior to placebo throughout the study and at 30 weeks (p < 0.0001) with respect to the change from baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II and III scores. The most frequently reported adverse events were nausea, headache and dizziness, but there were no unexpected serious adverse events related to the drug. The trial showed that ER CD-LD is safe and efficacious in patients with early Parkinson's disease.
The ADVANCE-PD study, a double-blind active-control parallel-group randomized phase 3 study, compared the efficacy and safety of ER CD-LD with immediate-release (IR) CD-LD in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. The primary endpoint of percentage of 'off time' during waking hours showed a significant decrease for ER CD-LD compared with IR CD-LD. ER CD-LD significantly improved the control of motor symptoms compared with IR CD-LD in several clinical measures including the UPDRS, Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGI), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-39 and modified Rankin test. ER CD-LD was generally well tolerated.
The ASCEND-PD study, a randomized double-blind two-period crossover trial, compared ER CD-LD with carbidopa-levodopa in combination with the COMT inhibitor entacapone (CD-LD-E) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease with motor fluctuations. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of 'off time' during waking hours based on subjects' diaries. ER CD-LD improved motor symptoms compared with CD-LD-E, demonstrating that it may be a useful treatment option in these patients.
Dopamine agonists
Dopamine agonists stimulate dopamine receptors directly and so bypass the degenerating presynaptic nigrostriatal neurons. Five types of dopamine receptors (D -D) have been identified so far, broadly divided into:
D -like receptors (D and D) - linked to adenylate cyclase
D -like receptors (D, D and D) - not linked to adenylate cyclase.
Improvement in motor function is generally attributed to D and D receptors, which are densely concentrated in the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen). D receptors are localized in the limbic regions that are important for regulation of behavior, mood and emotion. Ease of use, side effects and relative cost determine which dopamine agonist to choose (Table 4.2).
Efficacy. Pergolide and cabergoline are no longer recommended or in widespread use because of studies showing an association with ergot-related cardiac valvular disease. If absolutely indicated, cabergoline can only be used after pre-treatment echocardiography (ECG), with regular monitoring by ECG and chest X-ray during treatment. Lung and cardiac function should also be regularly monitored.
In this respect, non-ergot dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, ropinirole and the rotigotine transdermal patch are preferable (see Table 4.2). Longer-acting agonists such as the rotigotine skin patch, and once-daily ropinirole and pramipexole may also be used for added convenience and adherence.
Comparative studies of the efficacy of these newer dopamine agonists are scarce. The longer half-life of some dopamine agonists, and also their receptor specificity, may help in the provision of a more sustained and selective motor effect with fewer side effects (Table 4.3).
Continuous dopamine stimulation (CDS) is a relatively modern concept that has been shown to reduce the severity and incidence of dyskinesias based on the fact that pulsatile delivery of dopamine to the deafferented dopamine receptors in the striatum is likely to be dyskinesogenic.
CDS may prevent or reverse motor complications because it does not prime the basal ganglia for involuntary movements as much as agents that produce pulsatile stimulation. CDS may also improve some aspects of sleep in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, Nutt reinforced the idea that CDS remains a theoretical concept, and the effect of CDS on dyskinesias, to date, has never been tested in a robust randomized clinical trial. The STRIDE-PD study (see pages 66 -) with the drugs given orally every 3.5 hours probably failed to provide CDS.
In practice, dopamine agonists are also useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa, as well as the many theoretical advantages listed in Table 4.4.
Ropinirole and pramipexole are well-established non-ergot dopamine agonists in widespread clinical use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. Both are effective in early and late disease as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. In addition, pramipexole has been investigated for its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects in Parkinson's disease. A direct beneficial effect of pramipexole on depressive symptoms, accounting for 80% of total treatment effect, was found in a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the drug in 287 mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease patients with depressive symptoms.
In the 1990s, 8 patients with Parkinson's disease who were taking pramipexole or ropinirole were reported to have fallen asleep while driving, causing accidents. In Europe, this led to a driving ban for patients taking either of the two drugs, although the ban has now been lifted. Since then, similar episodes of unintended sleep have been reported in patients taking other dopaminergic drugs. Daytime sleepiness is likely to be a part of the disease process, which could be aggravated by the use of dopaminergic drugs. This important side effect is discussed in greater detail on pages 136 - (see Sleep disorders).
Rotigotine is the first transdermally delivered non-ergot dopamine agonist shown to be effective in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. Unlike the other non-ergot dopamine agonists it is effective in a once-daily application, and provides a theoretically attractive option for CDS by achieving constant plasma levels over 24 hours. In parkinsonian primate and mouse models, treatment with rotigotine produces virtually no dyskinesias.
In addition to D activity, rotigotine also has considerable affinity for the D receptor, unlike the other non-ergot dopamine agonists pramipexole and ropinirole. This is theoretically important because D activity is thought to synergistically enhance the effect mediated via D -like receptors. Rotigotine appears to have no affinity for 5-HT 2b receptors, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrotic side effects associated with ergot dopamine agonists, particularly cardiac valvulopathy.
Transdermal delivery also offers the advantage of preventing interaction with food and the first-pass metabolism associated with oral drugs. Approximately 1200 patients were enrolled worldwide in phase 3 trials in which rotigotine provided effective relief from the symptoms of both early and advanced Parkinson's disease.
In clinical trials, a rotigotine patch was associated with a reaction at the site of application in 39-44% of patients, although only a small subset had a severe reaction. The risk is reduced by changing the application site on a daily basis.
Rotigotine patches were withdrawn from the US market because of a problem with crystallization, but were reintroduced in 2012. The licensed doses are different from those in the UK.
Apomorphine is a highly potent D and D agonist that also acts on D receptors but has no opioid properties. It has a short half-life and is usually administered subcutaneously, either as a 'rescue' injection or by an infusion pump over 12, 18 or 24 hours. The effects of oral and rectal apomorphine are less reliable; delivery by transdermal iontophoresis, and the buccal, intranasal and rectal routes are under investigation. Occasionally, patients can stop taking levodopa, but most need regular doses in addition to apomorphine.
Apomorphine infusion benefits patients with refractory motor response fluctuations and diphasic dyskinesias. Continuous subcutaneous administration may be very useful in the later stages of the disease, producing a continuous antidyskinetic effect and smoothing 'on/off' fluctuations. In the case of injections, a response occurs after 10-15 minutes and lasts for 45-60 minutes. Self-injection, in a manner similar to the self-injection of insulin by people with diabetes, is ideal for 'rescuing' patients from disabling 'off' periods. The treatment can be labor-intensive and requires specialist nursing care. In the UK, where the treatment is well established, 'shared care' guidelines have been developed to help the delivery of apomorphine therapy, clearly setting out the shared responsibilities of primary and secondary care providers. This is not the case in the USA where apomorphine infusion is not yet licensed for use. Daily rotation of injection sites may prevent skin nodules, while local ultrasound therapy and skin massage can help to treat existing nodules.
Side effects of dopamine agonists
Nausea. The antiemetic domperidone (not available in the USA) used to be recommended for use with all dopamine agonists to prevent nausea. However, this is no longer the case as it has been found to be associated with cardiac dysrrythmia related to prologation of the QT interval. As such, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has advised that domperidone, 10 mg three times daily, should only be used for a maximum of 1 week. In the USA, alternative antiemetics such as trimethobenzamide, 250 mg three times daily, are used in conjunction with apomorphine to prevent nausea.
Sleep disorders. Unintended or abnormal sleepiness is a potentially dangerous adverse effect in patients taking dopaminergic agents. As well as the incidents reported in patients taking ropinirole and pramipexole (see page 71), similar episodes have been reported in patients taking pergolide, bromocriptine, cabergoline, apomorphine and levodopa. However, abnormal sleepiness has also been described in patients with Parkinson's disease at the time of diagnosis, when they are not yet receiving any dopamine-replacement therapy. Daytime sleepiness is, therefore, likely to be a combined effect of the disease process and dopaminergic drug treatment, and not a novel event related solely to the use of dopamine agonists.
A small percentage of patients with Parkinson's disease (possibly 0.5-1%) with excessive daytime sleepiness, may exhibit sudden onset of sleep resembling narcolepsy. For this reason, older patients receiving dopaminergic therapy should be assessed using both the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (for excessive daytime sleepiness) and the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS). A pragmatic view is that those who score more than 10 out of 24 on the Epworth scale, or less than 5 on item 15 of the PDSS, should be advised to exercise caution when driving, or preferably not to drive at all during the titration phase of therapy.
Studies suggest that somnolence is at its worst when dopaminergic therapy, particularly treatment with dopamine agonists, is being initiated and titrated up. In 'sleepy' patients, polysomnography may identify a subset of people with a phenotype similar to that for narcolepsy, or it may unearth sleep apnea as a cause of daytime sleepiness.
Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS), which resembles addiction, has been described in mostly young male patients with Parkinson's disease. DDS is typically linked to levodopa therapy when doses are increased continuously and beyond the level required to treat motor disability. The emerging pattern is that of a compulsive medication overuse associated with cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Patients are also liable to develop impulse-control disorders or punding behavior. Patients crave the drug and have unpleasant 'off' periods. As a result, they increase the dose of drugs that have been prescribed 'as required' or increase doses for reported 'off' periods. Patients often seek alternative drug sources such as internet sites, and drug hoarding and hiding are common. The condition has been termed variously as:
homeostatic hedonistic dysregulation
impulse dysregulation
compulsive behavior syndrome
reward-seeking behavior.
Punding may be seen in association with DDS or in isolation, and implies an intense fascination with repetitive tasks. These complex repetitive behaviors were first described in psychostimulant addicts, and the phenomenon is similar to that observed in animals with amphetamine-induced stereotyped behaviors. The behaviors may develop from pre-existing habits, depending on an individual's previous occupation and interests. Examples include hoarding, handling, labeling and sorting objects, spending excessive time on a computer, writing or drawing, and aimless walkabouts. In men, the manipulation or dismantling of machines and tools is often reported.
Impulse-control disorders. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) defines impulse control disorders (ICDs) as the failure to resist an impulse, drive or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others. These are increasingly reported in Parkinson's disease and include a range of compulsive disorders (Table 4.5). Typically, the syndrome is characterized by a combination of impulsivity, compulsivity and preoccupation with a behavior or mood state. Unrecognized, ICDs can have serious consequences, such as breakdowns in interpersonal relationships and financial distress. The lifetime prevalence of ICDs, as reported by patients attending specialized clinics, is between 3 and 8%, although the DOMINION study reported a higher rate of 13.7% with ICDs, including problem/pathological gambling (5%), compulsive sexual behavior (3.5%), compulsive buying (5.7%) and binge-eating disorder (4.3%).
Men with early-onset Parkinson's disease and a history of alcohol misuse, illicit drug use or affective disorders may be susceptible to this syndrome. Abnormal dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to a reward has been postulated as a possible mechanism. The treatment is complex and requires slow withdrawal of dopamine agonists, use of atypical neuroleptics and/or antidepressants, counseling and input from a neuropsychiatrist.
Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome. Abrupt cessation of therapy with dopamine agonists can lead to a dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS). It can present with a wide range of symptoms including panic attacks, anxiety, social phobia, depression, vomiting and symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. It rarely responds to levodopa, antidepressants or anxiolytics. However, it may improve with cautious reintroduction of low-dose dopamine agonists.
Fibrosis. The risk of serosal fibrosis in relation to ergot-derived drugs was first described in 1966. There have been several reports of cardiac, retroperitoneal and pleuropulmonary fibrosis in patients taking ergot-derived dopamine agonists such as pergolide, cabergoline and bromocriptine. Serosal fibrosis is a serious complication that is often irreversible.
The increased affinity of ergot-derived dopamine agonists for 5-HT 2b receptors has been cited as a possible mechanism. In practice, given the availability of non-ergot agonists (see above), the use of ergot dopamine agonists is no longer recommended.
COMT metabolizes dopamine and levodopa, producing two inactive metabolites, 3- O -methyl-dopamine and 3- O -methyl-dopa. Two COMT inhibitors, tolcapone and entacapone, are available; they extend the plasma half-life of levodopa, thus increasing the concentrations of levodopa and dopamine within the brain (Table 4.6; Figure 4.2). COMT inhibition prolongs 'on' time by 30-60%, which may increase the duration of, but not worsen, peak-dose dyskinesias.
Tolcapone blocks COMT in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. In November 1998, the European Medical Evaluation Agency withdrew tolcapone in the EU because of three cases of fatal fulminant hepatitis; sales were also suspended in Canada and Australia. In the USA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that regular liver function tests be performed. Tolcapone was re-released in Europe, but now its use must be accompanied by regular blood tests to monitor liver function. The FDA advises that levels of alanine and aspartate transaminase (ALT/AST) should be determined at baseline, then every 2-4 weeks during the first 6 months of therapy and then at intervals deemed clinically relevant. In the USA, tolcapone should be discontinued if ALT or AST levels exceed two times the normal upper limit. The patient consent form has been replaced with a patient acknowledgment form. The usual starting dose is 100 mg/day, increasing to 200 mg three times daily. Dyskinesia and nausea are common side effects, but diarrhea is the most common reason for drug withdrawal. Patients should be warned that the drug may color their urine.
Entacapone, 200 mg with each dose of levodopa, acts only peripherally, unlike tolcapone. No hepatobiliary side effects have been reported, and routine liver function tests are not required. The incidence of diarrhea is also less frequent than with tolcapone. Other side effects include hypotension, sedation, headache and dyskinesias. Patients should be forewarned that the drug may turn urine a reddish-orange color.
A combined formulation of entacapone, decarboxylase inhibitor and levodopa has been licensed for use in the USA, Europe and certain parts of Asia; the drug should make adherence easier for patients taking entacapone and is likely to be administered for treatment of early 'wearing-off' symptoms. Its use may be refined with a new scale/questionnaire designed to assess 'wearing off', as described by Stacy et al.
Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors
Selegiline, 10 mg once daily or 5 mg twice daily orally (or 1.25 mg once daily by buccal administration), is a selective irreversible blocker of intra- and extraneuronal MAOB, and reduces metabolism of dopamine (Figure 4.3). The sublingual form of selegiline (1.25-2.5 mg/day) can be administered as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with fluctuations.
In animal models, selegiline blocks the conversion of MPTP to MPP +, which is toxic to dopaminergic neurons (see Figure 2.4). On this basis, it was thought that MAOB inhibition with selegiline might slow the decline in human Parkinson's disease by neuroprotection. However, the double-blind prospective placebo-controlled DATATOP study (Deprenyl And Tocopherol Antioxidant Therapy for Parkinsonism) in 1993, failed to confirm the neuroprotective property of selegiline. Furthermore, in the mid-1990s a report by the Parkinson's Disease Research Group (UK) suggested a 60% increase in mortality among patients receiving continued selegiline therapy, although this has not been substantiated.
Side effects of MAOB inhibition include hallucinations, sleep disorders, agitation, postural hypotension and withdrawal problems. Although a lower-dose formulation of selegiline (2.5 mg) with a better safety profile is available, its clinical role remains unclear: it is not neuroprotective, and safety in older patients is uncertain. However, it can have a useful dopa-sparing effect and may stimulate drowsy patients (Table 4.7).
Rasagiline is a second-generation irreversible selective MAOB inhibitor that is administered orally at a dosage of 0.5-1 mg once daily. Approved dosing of this drug varies in different countries: the approved dose in Europe is 1 mg, while both 0.5 mg and 1 mg doses are approved in the USA, so that adjunctive therapy initiated at 0.5 mg can be raised to 1 mg if effectiveness is insufficient at the lower dose. It is approximately five times more potent than selegiline, and, in animal models, rasagiline increased cellular antioxidant activity and antiapoptotic factors.
In clinical trials, patients started late on rasagiline appeared to have worse motor scores than those initiated on rasagiline, prompting some researchers to suggest that rasagiline may have a disease-modifying role in Parkinson's disease (see pages 89 -). Several randomized controlled trials have shown rasagiline's efficacy as monotherapy or as an adjunct to levodopa in Parkinson's disease.
Safinamide is a glutamate antagonist as well as a MAOB inhibitor and a partial dopamine agonist. Trials suggest that this agent may improve motor function and reduce dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease, and may have some additional non-motor benefits. Safinamide has been approved in the EU (but is not yet licensed in the UK) as oral once-daily add-on therapy to levodopa alone or in combination with other treatments in patients with mid- to late-stage Parkinson's disease.
Phase 3 trials have shown that safinamide significantly improves motor function in early Parkinson's disease in patients taking a single dopamine agonist at a stable dose (MOTION study) and significantly improves motor fluctuations in patients with mid- to late-stage disease taking levodopa and other Parkinson's disease drugs at a stable dose (SETTLE study). Safinamide has also demonstrated statistically significant improvement in quality of life in the short (6 months) and long term (up to 2 years), as assessed by the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life (PDQ-39) and/or the European Quality of Life (EuroQoL, EQ-5D) scales.
Anticholinergics block the action of acetylcholine against dopamine within the basal ganglia (Figure 4.4). Data on the comparative efficacies of the different anticholinergic drugs are not available.
Historically, these drugs were used as an adjunct to levodopa therapy, helping to control rest-tremor and dystonia. However, they are no longer recommended in modern practice, particularly in older parkinsonian patients because of the risk of inducing a confusional state and aggravating/accelerating dementia.
Side effects include urinary retention, constipation, blurred vision, precipitation of narrow-angle glaucoma, dry mouth, memory problems and confusion. If neuropsychiatric side effects necessitate withdrawal of anticholinergic therapy, this should be carried out slowly in order to avoid a withdrawal syndrome that itself includes a confusional state associated with akinesia and disorientation.
Other drugs
Pardoprunox is a partial dopamine agonist (mainly at D and D receptors) and also a full 5-HT 1A receptor agonist. It is being investigated for use in levodopa-treated fluctuating patients and its effect on 'off' and 'on' times without troublesome dyskinesias.
Amantadine, 100-400 mg daily, is an antiviral agent with an antiparkinsonian effect. Its mechanisms of action include:
increased dopamine synthesis
an amphetamine-like action releasing catecholamines from presynaptic stores
blocking dopamine and noradrenaline reuptake
mild anticholinergic action
antiglutamate action by antagonism at the N -methyl-D-aspartate receptors.
The antiparkinsonian effect of amantadine is mild, and is useful in young patients to delay the introduction of levodopa. The effect is long-lasting, and patients may deteriorate markedly if the drug is withdrawn.
Amantadine should be given as a single dose in the morning to prevent sleep problems. At high doses, amantadine has an antidyskinetic action that may last up to 9 months, but high doses can cause visual hallucinations, confusion and agitation. Amantadine can cause a specific discoloration of the legs called livedo reticularis.
When to initiate treatment
Precisely when to begin treatment is controversial (Table 4.8). Some experts advocate early treatment to provide maximum clinical benefit to patients, whereas others prefer to delay initiation of treatment in order to minimize the risk of medication-related side effects including levodopa-related motor complications. The misconception that the benefits of levodopa treatment are limited to a finite period of time has caused many physicians to inappropriately delay the introduction of symptomatic therapy. With the development of pharmaceutical agents that are safe and well tolerated, with the potential to influence disease outcomes, there has been a call to reconsider the potential value of early intervention.
PDLIFE study. The argument for treatment of Parkinson's disease at diagnosis has been strengthened by the publication of the UK's prospective PDLIFE study, a national audit of the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease. Findings indicate a progressive and significant deterioration in the self-reported health status of patients with Parkinson's disease who are left untreated at diagnosis compared with those who are treated. The work has reignited the debate of whether to initiate treatment of the disease at diagnosis or whether to adopt a 'wait and watch' policy. If a neuroprotective agent became available it would be instituted as early as possible, even before the appearance of motor symptoms. Nevertheless, the issue of neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease remains controversial (see pages 89 -).
Choice of treatment
All patients with Parkinson's disease who require drug treatment should be given the opportunity to make an informed choice from the range of treatment options available, including dopamine agonists, other levodopa-sparing agents, levodopa and combination therapy. The main aims are to:
keep the drug regimen as simple as possible
aid adherence
reduce the likelihood of side effects.
Theoretically, attempts should be made to stick to a regimen that mimics CDS as much as possible. Long-acting agents, or continuous delivery systems such as the rotigotine transdermal patch, or controlled-release preparations of other non-ergot dopamine agonists may be particularly useful in this regard.
It is very important that the patient's lifestyle, amount of support at home and individual preferences are all taken into consideration, and that the different therapeutic options with their potential side effects and advantages are explained.
Modern management of Parkinson's disease is not possible without the support of a multidisciplinary care team. A typical multidisciplinary team should consist of a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist, a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and an experienced speech and language therapist with access to neuropsychology and palliative care.
Current guidelines. Different international guidelines (NICE, AAN, EFNS/MDS-ES) all agree that there is no single universal first choice of drug for people with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the early stages of the condition. Individual choice of drug will be influenced, for example, by the degree of motor disability (if severe, the first choice is likely to be levodopa), occupational needs, the risk of motor complications (more common in younger patients, which would be delayed by agonists), neuropsychiatric complications (more common in older and cognitively impaired patients, so agonists should be avoided), patient/clinician preferences and adherence issues. For these reasons, many younger patients will choose a levodopa-sparing strategy, while older patients may prefer levodopa therapy (see below).
Guidelines for the management of Parkinson's disease published in the UK by NICE in June 2006 offer evidence-based advice drawn up by a multidisciplinary panel. Key recommendations are that patients and their carers should be involved in deciding their treatment and care, and that the choice of treatment should suit the patient's needs and preferences. This guideline is currently being updated. The following key points were identified as priorities for implementation.
Any patient with a suspected diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be seen by a specialist within 6 weeks after referral by the primary care physician. A specialist is defined as an individual with expertise in the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be reviewed every 6-12 months. The apomorphine and levodopa challenge tests should not be used to differentiate Parkinson's disease from atypical parkinsonian syndromes.
Regular access to specialist nursing care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy should be available to patients.
Patients and their carers should be given an opportunity to discuss palliative care issues. No specific agents could be identified as the treatment of choice in either early or advanced disease.
The guidelines also emphasize the need for considering non-motor symptoms at all stages of Parkinson's disease.
Guidelines for the management of Parkinson's disease in other countries are broadly similar to the NICE guidelines. They include those of the AAN, published in 2002 and modified in 2006, and those issued by the joint task force of the EFNS and the Movement Disorder Society's European Section in 2006.
More recent guidelines from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) highlight the following issues as key to the modern 'holistic' treatment of Parkinson's disease:
communication throughout disease progression
attitudes to drug treatment
information needs in relation to multifaceted areas
family carers' needs
non-motor symptoms
importance of multidisciplinary team working.
The SIGN's suggested scheme for therapy is shown in Figure 4.5.
Dopamine agonist versus levodopa. In younger patients, the issues of neuroprotection and dyskinesias should be considered. The results of four controlled dopamine-agonist monotherapy trials have been published and suggest that initiation of treatment with an agonist is beneficial in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. However, the results of the PD Med study, a multicenter real-life pragmatic study, reporting on quality of life-related outcomes in both young and old patients with Parkinson's disease, is likely to generate considerable controversy regarding the use of dopamine agonists and the choice of initial therapy. In total, 1620 patients with early Parkinson's disease were recruited and given one of three initial treatment regimens:
levodopa formulation (528 patients)
levodopa-sparing strategy - dopamine agonist (632 patients)
levodopa-sparing strategy - MAOB inhibitor (selegiline; 460 patients).
The study started in 2000 with a median follow-up of 3 years and maximum of 7 years. During this time the dopamine agonists varied, including ergot agonists that are no longer in widespread use. The randomization to levodopa or alternative regimens was at the discretion of the clinician and a large part of the study was conducted in centers for the care of the elderly. The findings suggest relatively small but persistent benefits of starting therapy with levodopa rather than the listed alternatives. Interestingly, initial treatment with a MAOB inhibitor appeared to be at least as effective as treatment with a dopamine agonist.
Patients assigned to the levodopa arm scored, on average, 1.8 points (95% CI 0.5-3.0) higher on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) mobility subscale than those assigned to levodopa-sparing therapies; however, the effects on non-motor aspects of the scale are unclear. A cost-utility analysis of the study will be reported separately.
If levodopa is used and the dose is titrated to the response, most patients initially need 50-100 mg three times daily to produce a consistent effect without fluctuations. Within 2-3 years, most will need a more frequent dosage to avoid fluctuations; smaller, more frequent doses (every 2-3 hours) often lead to an overall increase in dose. COMT inhibitors or dopamine agonists can, however, be introduced instead of increasing the frequency of levodopa.
Monitoring. Scales for monitoring Parkinson's disease, and thus the response to treatment, include:
Movement Disorder Society's UPDRS
Hoehn and Yahr Disease Staging Scale (Table 4.9)
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (long form - PDQ 39; short form - PDQ 8)
EuroQol (patient-related quality of life)
Carer Strain Index
Epworth Sleepiness Scale
Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale
Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest; see Figure 3.5)
Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS)
Parkinson's Disease Fatigue Scale.
Neuroprotection is a concept whereby a treatment may affect the underlying pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and slow or halt the inexorable progression of the condition. Neuroprotective therapies already investigated or under review include caffeine, minocycline, nicotine, estrogen, creatine, lazaroids, bioenergetics, antiapoptotic drugs (CEP-1347, TCH-346), GM-1 ganglioside and GPi-1485. MAOB inhibitors and dopamine agonists have been clinically evaluated for neuroprotective properties based on positive results in animal models.
In the early 2000s, the CALM-PD study (Comparison of the Agonist pramipexole vs Levodopa on Motor complications in Parkinson's Disease) and the REAL-PET study (Ropinirole as EArly therapy versus Levodopa - PET study) generated speculation among researchers that dopamine agonists such as ropinirole and pramipexole may have a neuroprotective role. The results were reported as partially positive, although methodological and logistical problems with these studies have prevented recommendation of these drugs specifically for neuroprotection. The trial designs did not take non-motor symptoms into account and could not exclude the regulatory effect of drugs on the imaging findings. Furthermore, clinical rating scales showed that the patients who received levodopa had better outcomes than those who received the agonists.
Trials with CEP-1347 and TCH-346, and more recently smilagenin, have been negative. Coenzyme Q10 has demonstrated encouraging potential as a neuroprotective agent in large doses, but trial data have been negative. In the USA, small 'futility studies' are being supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the Michael J Fox Foundation to investigate agents with the potential to slow progression of the disease. See Chapter 9 (pages 155 -) for more information on emerging therapies in this area.
The ADAGIO study. Rasagiline has been studied in the delayed-start ADAGIO study (Attenuation of Disease progression with Azilect Once-daily), which comprised two phases, each lasting 36 weeks. In phase 1, patients were randomized to one of four groups: rasagiline, 1 mg or 2 mg/day (early-start group), or corresponding placebo. In phase 2, the subjects in the early-start group remained on the same regimen, while the subjects in the placebo group were switched to rasagiline 1 mg or 2 mg/day (delayed-start group). At the end of the study, the early-start group who had received rasagiline 1 mg/day for 72 weeks showed a positive result, but those who had received 2 mg/day for the full study period did not. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear but may be partly explained by a more robust symptomatic benefit from the 2 mg dose that masked the disease-modifying effect. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed a positive result for both the 1 mg and 2 mg dose for those subjects who had the highest quartile scores on the UPDRS at baseline. Although this does not make the study positive, it does suggest the need for further research, id est larger and longer delayed-start studies using the 2 mg/day dose in patients with more advanced Parkinson's disease.
It should be noted that the difference in UPDRS between the early- and delayed-start groups was small (1.7 points) and its clinical significance is hard to ascertain. However, the object of this study was not to determine the clinical significance of a disease-modifying therapy, but to see if the benefit from therapy was secondary to disease modification, id est something more than symptomatic improvement.
The ADAGIO study is an important landmark clinical trial that suggests early treatment with rasagiline, 1 mg/day, confers benefits that are not duplicated by delayed treatment with the same agent. However, no 'definitive' recommendations or guidelines can be made from these results. Clinicians will have to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the patient would benefit from rasagiline. Cost, concomitant medications and a possible disease-modifying benefit will have to be factored into the decision-making process by the patient and the treating physician.
The ADAGIO Follow-Up (AFU) study investigated the long-term effect of rasagiline in ADAGIO study participants and the long-term benefits of early- versus delayed-start rasagiline treatment. Although clinically important improvements were seen in a substantial number of patients, the study failed to demonstrate significant differences between the original ADAGIO early- and delayed-start groups. However, these results should be interpreted with caution given the significant gap, and loss of participants, between the time of the ADAGIO and AFU studies.
The PROUD study (PRamipexole On Underlying Disease) is another delayed-start trial, which investigated the disease-modifying effect of pramipexole in early Parkinson's disease. In phase 1, 535 patients were randomized to double-blind placebo or pramipexole, 1.5 mg/day for 6-9 months. In phase 2, all patients were administered pramipexole, 1.5 mg/day, for up to 15 months. The primary endpoint was a change from the baseline UPDRS total score after 15 months, and a substudy assessed the change in DaTSCAN uptake after 15 months. In total, 411 patients were included in the primary assessment. After 15 months there was no difference between the early- and delayed-start group and DaTSCAN uptake was also similar. The results did not support a disease-modifying effect of pramipexole.
Treatment of non-motor symptoms
The AAN and MDS task force documents for managing non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease recognize the need for clinical studies in this area, as good quality trials providing a level 1 evidence base for the treatment of non-motor symptoms are few and far between. Table 4.10 summarizes the evidence base for the treatment of the small number of non-motor symptoms for which controlled trials have been conducted. The few randomized controlled studies that have addressed the non-motor aspects of Parkinson's disease are outlined below.
The RECOVER study (Randomized Evaluation of the 24-hour COVerage: Efficacy of Rotigotine) was a multinational double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 287 patients with Parkinson's disease who had unsatisfactory early-morning symptom control. Patients received either a rotigotine transdermal patch, 2-16 mg/day (n = 190), or placebo (n = 97). This was the first time an international clinical trial protocol included measures of non-motor symptoms, such as nocturnal sleep disturbance, along with early morning motor function as co-primary efficacy endpoints using the UPDRS Part III (motor examination) and the modified Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2). The overall effect on non-motor symptoms was also assessed using the Parkinson's disease non-motor scale (NMSS).
As well as significant motor improvement with rotigotine patch therapy (p = 0.0002), there was highly significant improvement in the mean PDSS-2 total score (a decrease of −5.9 points with rotigotine vs −1.9 points with placebo, p < 0.0001). The NMSS score also registered a significant improvement in sleep and mood.
Detailed post hoc analysis of the RECOVER data has shown efficacy for mild to moderate pain in Parkinson's disease as well as sleep and mood. The rotigotine transdermal patch is now being investigated for pain in Parkinson's disease using the King's Parkinson disease pain scale.
PANDA was a multisite double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel-group study in male and female subjects with confirmed Parkinson's disease and severe pain, as assessed by a new pain classification system for Parkinson's disease. The study evaluated treatment with prolonged-release oxycodone combined with naloxone (OXN PR). Subjects were randomized to receive either OXN PR or placebo for up to 112 days. The primary endpoint of improvement of average 24-hour pain score after 16 weeks was not met in the full analysis population but the per protocol population analysis revealed that adherence to OXN PR significantly improved average 24-hour pain scores at 16 weeks compared with placebo (p = 0.010). Furthermore, the results showed a significant improvement in the 24-hour pain score after 4 weeks (p = 0.018), 8 weeks (p = 0.011) and 12 weeks (p = 0.021). This was the first ever randomized placebo-controlled study to assess Parkinson's-associated pain as a primary outcome measure.
The EuroInf study, an open-label prospective observational 6-month multicenter study, compared 43 patients on apomorphine with 44 on intrajejunal levodopa infusion (IJLI). It is the first study to consider non-motor symptom scores as the primary outcome. Patients treated with IJLI showed large improvement (effect size = 0.83) on the NMSS total score. Patients treated with apomorphine had moderate improvement (effect size = 0.53) on the NMSS total score with significantly more improvement in mood and apathy NMSS scores than IJLI.
Overall, health-related quality of life and non-motor symptoms improved in 75% of patients receiving IJLI; a similar proportion of patients receiving apomorphine showed improvement in health-related quality of life. Adverse effects included peritonitis with IJLI and skin nodules with apomorphine.
The IMPACT study, a non-randomized controlled trial, was conducted in six hospitals in the Netherlands to address the role of a multidisciplinary approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The primary outcomes were activities of daily living measured with the Academic Medical Center linear disability score and quality of life measured with the Parkinson's disease quality of life questionnaire. Results were analysed at 4, 6 and 8 months. Secondary outcomes included motor functioning (measured by UPDRS part III at 4 months), and caregiver burden and costs (during the whole study period). The results showed that the multidisciplinary care approach conferred only small benefits compared with normal integrated care in the Netherlands. The study did not reach statistical significance. However, the authors concluded that alternative approaches need to be devised and explored to achieve more substantial health benefits.","<BULL> Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately. <BULL> Fear over the toxicity of levodopa has resulted in levodopa phobia in some patients; however, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. <BULL> Dopamine agonists are useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa therapy; some, such as rotigotine, may offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation in practice and specifically offer night-time and early morning benefit. <BULL> Treatment decisions should be based on the degree of disability, occupational needs, age, patient/clinician preference and adherence issues; neuroprotection remains a theoretical argument, while dyskinesias and wearing off are an important consideration in younger patients. <BULL> Trial data indicate that treatment of Parkinson's disease could be initiated with levodopa, oral dopamine agonists or a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor.

They have been shown to reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease by increasing the dose of levodopa. They have also been shown to decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease by decreasing the dose of dopamine. The antiparkinsonian effect of levodopa is mild, and is useful in young patients. However, this is no longer the case as it has been found to be associated with cardiac dysrrythmia related to prologation of the QT interval. It has been shown that levodopa is not effective in Parkinson's disease.Dopamine and Levodopa have been used in Parkinson's disease for many years. It has been reported that levodopa and Levodopa are effective for Parkinson's disease. It has been found to reduce the risk for Parkinson's disease in patients with Parkinson's disease.

9781908541727,ch03,"Blurred vision
The most common causes of blurred vision are refractive error (in the young) and cataract (in the elderly). However, blurred vision can also be the presenting symptom of potentially blinding intraocular disease such as retinal detachment, or potentially fatal extraocular disease such as vasculitis, brain tumor or stroke.
It is essential to be able to clinically triage your patients with blurred vision into the majority for whom routine written referral to an ophthalmologist is appropriate and the minority who require urgent referral (to be seen the same day).
Delay in referral of urgent cases, of even a few days, can cost the patient their sight. Patients with none of the features requiring urgent referral may be referred routinely, but should be advised to contact you if there are any major changes in their symptoms while they are waiting to be seen by the ophthalmologist.
Causes of acute visual loss
Patients suspected of having any of the diseases outlined in this section should be referred urgently, as immediate ophthalmic medical or surgical treatment may be able to recover or stabilize sight.
Retinal detachment. The retina lines the inner aspect of the back wall of the eye and consists of specialist cells called rods and cones (photoreceptors). These cells convert the focused light falling upon the retina to electrical energy to send to the brain to give us vision. The retina also contains the retinal pigment epithelium, which lies beneath the photoreceptors and helps them function, and the neural connections above the photoreceptors which form the optic nerve.
The retina can peel off the back wall of the eye, usually after traction from the vitreous jelly tears a hole in the retina (Figure 3.1). Fluid may then enter through this hole and cause the retina to detach. This will lead to progressive loss of vision. If the detachment is diagnosed before it reaches the central visual area (the macula), urgent surgical repair can maintain good vision. Short-sighted patients have a greater risk of retinal detachment.
Patients with retinal detachment complain of one or more of:
flashes - white flashes of light in the peripheral vision
floaters - new, previously unnoticed, shower of floating spots in the vision
field loss - a dark 'curtain' or 'cloud' developing over part of the peripheral vision and moving towards the central vision over a period of hours, days or weeks.
Examination shows normal or decreased acuity, sometimes a field defect to confrontation testing and sometimes a RAPD on the swinging light test. The detachment is not usually visible with the direct ophthalmoscope (unless extensive), as its field of view is too small.
Retinal vascular occlusions are occlusions of one of the branch retinal veins or arteries, or the central retinal vein or artery. Vein occlusion is usually due to thrombosis; arterial occlusion is often due to embolism from the carotid artery or heart. Patients complain of sudden or subacute blurring of vision or visual field loss in one eye. Examination shows:
reduced visual acuity (VA) (although some branch occlusions present with field loss only and no reduction in acuity)
field defect to confrontation
RAPD on the swinging light test (sometimes, in severe occlusions).
For arterial occlusions, direct ophthalmoscopy may show retinal pallor and decreased arterial filling in the distribution of the occlusion (sectoral for branch artery occlusion; diffuse with a central macular 'cherry-red spot' in central artery occlusion - Figure 3.2a). However, these signs may easily be missed with the direct ophthalmoscope because of its poor field of view.
Vein occlusions (Figures 3.2b and 2c) are often more visible on ophthalmoscopy, with sectoral (branch vein) or diffuse (central vein) retinal hemorrhages, tortuous dilated veins and (often) optic disc swelling (central vein).
It is important to remember that retinal venous occlusions are often warning signs of previously undetected or undertreated hypertension, diabetes, raised pressure in the eye (glaucoma), or (in young patients) coagulopathy. Arterial occlusions may be the first sign of temporal arteritis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, carotid stenosis or a cardiac embolic source (exempli gratia heart valve disease).
Vitreous hemorrhage is bleeding into the vitreous jelly in the main eye cavity (Figure 3.3). Causes include bleeding from abnormal new retinal vessels in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, a retinal tear or detachment, or trauma. Patients complain of floaters and blurred vision. Examination shows normal or reduced acuity, but usually no RAPD unless retinal detachment is also present. The red reflex may be abnormal if there is major hemorrhage. Areas of blood in the vitreous may or may not be visible with the direct ophthalmoscope.
Any diabetic patient complaining of new-onset floaters (with or without blurred vision) should be taken especially seriously, because of the high risk that new vessels are bleeding.
'Wet' age-related macular degeneration ('wet' AMD). The macula is the center of the retina and is the area responsible for high definition vision and color vision. Most AMD is 'dry' (that is, no abnormal new vessels are present) and results in gradually progressive loss of central vision.
In 'wet' AMD, leakage from abnormal new blood vessels (Figure 3.4) causes:
acute or subacute onset of blurred vision, or sudden worsening of previously poor vision
distortion of straight lines or shapes (metamorphopsia)
often, a central blurred or blank spot in the vision, with normal peripheral vision (central scotoma).
The macula is very difficult to examine with the direct ophthalmoscope, especially without the use of dilating drops, but it may show hemorrhages and hard exudates. Urgent treatment with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent by injection into the eye can make a significant difference to prognosis for vision if the condition is detected and treated early.
Acute optic neuropathy. In this condition, the optic nerve behind one or both eyes loses some or all of its capability to transmit impulses, resulting in blurred vision in the affected eye/s. The cardinal sign in all unilateral optic neuropathies is an RAPD on the swinging light test.
There are many possible causes of acute optic neuropathy. In young adults, the most common cause is 'typical' optic neuritis (an early sign of multiple sclerosis in some, but not all, patients). Rapid unilateral loss of vision occurs, with pain that worsens when the eye moves. The optic disc may appear normal or swollen on ophthalmoscopy (Figure 3.5).
In middle-aged or elderly patients, the most common cause is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy - blockage of the fine arteries that supply the optic disc due to temporal arteritis or atherosclerosis. The disease presents as sudden visual loss with a swollen optic disc, which is painless (unless there is a headache associated with temporal arteritis).
Vision loss soon after eye surgery. If the patient develops blurred vision with a 'white' eye soon after eye surgery, they could have retinal detachment, or a swelling of the macula called cystoid macular edema. If they develop blurred vision with a red eye they probably have an infection inside the eyeball (endophthalmitis; see Figure 2.6, page 26). Urgent referral is needed if patients develop problems following surgery.
Causes of gradual visual loss
Patients suspected of having one of the diseases in this section can be referred routinely unless one or more of the criteria for urgent referral are present (exempli gratia flashes, floaters, visual field defect or RAPD).
Refractive error and presbyopia. It is rare for patients to complain of blurred vision due to uncorrected refractive error, as the first thing patients with blurred vision usually do is have their glasses checked. However, if a patient with gradually progressive blurred vision has not had their glasses prescription reviewed for several years, it is worth arranging this with their optometrist before ophthalmic referral (especially if VA improves with pinhole testing), unless you have found an indication for urgent referral.
The common types of refractive error are:
myopia (short-sightedness)
hypermetropia (long-sightedness)
astigmatism (corneal surface is more curved in one direction; like a rugby ball rather than a football)
presbyopia (the loss of the eye's ability to focus on close objects with age).
Middle-aged patients whose distance vision is fine, but whose reading vision is deteriorating, may be experiencing presbyopia. This is easily corrected with reading glasses or bifocals.
Cataract is a clouding of the eye's normally clear lens (Figure 3.6). Cataract usually occurs in the elderly, or in younger patients with diabetes, intraocular inflammation or eye trauma. Patients complain of gradually progressive blurring of vision, which may be asymmetric, and sometimes glare in bright lights. Visual fields are full to confrontation, there is no RAPD, the eyes look normal externally (apart from a gray rather than black pupil in cases of advanced cataract) and there may be a dulling of the red reflex.
Cataract extraction and intraocular artificial lens implantation is a common and highly successful operation.
Chronic glaucoma causes slow, painless loss of vision, which is usually not noticed by the patient because peripheral vision is lost first. Central vision loss signifies severe disease and can occur if the condition is not detected early by routine population screening. Chronic glaucoma is common, and risk increases with age. People with a family history of glaucoma are at increased risk and may develop the disease at a younger age.
Regular examination by an optometrist every 2 years is recommended from the age of 40 to look for signs of glaucoma. If there is a strong family history of glaucoma, annual examination from an earlier age may be required. The examination should include an eye pressure test, optic disc examination and automated visual fields.
The eyes of a patient with chronic glaucoma appear entirely normal on examination, apart from raised intraocular pressure (in most but not all patients) and characteristic 'cupping' of one or both optic discs (Figure 3.7). Do not confuse this condition with acute glaucoma, which is much rarer and presents with a painful red eye and blurred vision (see Chapter 2).
Eye drops are the usual first-line treatment, but laser treatment or surgery is performed if eye drops fail to control the pressure or if the glaucoma is severe. Be aware that some glaucoma eye drops can have systemic effects; for example, beta-blockers (such as timolol) may exacerbate asthma, bradycardia, depression or hyperlipidemia. Most modern glaucoma drops can be given once a day and with minimal side effects.
Diabetic maculopathy. All of your practice's diabetic patients should be enrolled for regular (usually annual) diabetic retinopathy screening. The right time to treat diabetic maculopathy (or proliferative retinopathy) is in its early stages, before it becomes symptomatic. Laser treatments, slow-release steroid injections and anti-VEGF injections are used for this condition.
Patients who have advanced diabetic maculopathy that has not been detected by screening complain of blurred vision and metamorphopsia. Early diabetic maculopathy is very difficult to see with the direct ophthalmoscope, particularly without the aid of dilating drops. Advanced cases may show microaneurysms (small red dots) and hard exudates (yellow lipid deposits from leaky microaneurysms) at or near the macula (Figure 3.8).
Because of the high risk of serious retinal disease, diabetic patients who complain of acute or subacute onset of blurred vision or visual distortion require urgent referral.
'Dry' age-related macular degeneration ('dry' AMD). In the elderly, age-related changes in the macula often cause gradual, usually mild-to-moderate, loss of vision, although in some cases it can also cause severe visual loss. In the early stages of macular degeneration patients are aware that they need more light to read and it takes longer to adjust from light to dark environments and vice versa. Patients complain of increasing difficulty reading and blurred central vision with preserved peripheral vision. The macula is very difficult to examine with the direct ophthalmoscope, especially if dilating drops are not used, but drusen (small yellow spots from the waste products of cell metabolism) or areas of pigment atrophy and/or black pigment clumps may be seen (Figure 3.9).
Superimposed on this gradual decline of vision, a minority of patients also experience a sudden loss of central vision with distortion due to the development of 'wet' AMD.
Low-vision aids, such as magnifiers and good lighting, often help to maximize the patient's vision if they have dry changes, but urgent referral is needed for patients with 'wet' AMD so that anti-VEGF injection treatment can be given quickly.
Slowly progressive optic neuropathy. Tumors in the orbit or pituitary region often compress one or both optic nerves or the optic chiasm, and usually present with gradual visual field loss and/or loss of VA in one or both eyes.
There are also many other causes of chronic optic neuropathy, including infections, autoimmune disease, pernicious anemia and nutritional deficiency.
A visual field defect (of any type) may be found on confrontation testing, and an RAPD will be found if the condition is unilateral or asymmetric. The optic disc/s may look normal, swollen or, as shown in Figure 3.10, pale. If slowly progressive optic neuropathy is suspected, urgent referral is necessary because there may be an underlying brain tumor.
Gradual loss of vision after cataract surgery. Patients who complain of a slow decline in initially good vision after cataract surgery most commonly have posterior capsular fibrosis (scarring that develops behind the intraocular lens); this is easily treated with laser therapy. Although rare, chronic macular edema and retinal detachment can also occur, as can other eye disease completely unrelated to the cataract surgery.
Causes of transient visual loss
Transient visual loss that is not the prodrome of known migraine is always serious and requires urgent ophthalmic referral. Dangerous causes of non-migrainous transient visual loss include carotid stenosis, heart valve disease, transient ischemic attack and papilledema due to a brain tumor.
Transient visual loss in one eye is usually the result of an embolus from a stenosed ipsilateral carotid artery or, less often, an embolus from a cardiac valve. However, in patients over 50, transient visual loss in one eye can also be a warning sign of subsequent permanent visual loss from temporal arteritis (urgent treatment at this stage of temporal arteritis can often avert acute bilateral blindness).
Patients with monocular, embolic, transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) report a sudden loss of vision, as if a curtain comes down over their eye, followed by a spontaneous return of vision a few minutes to an hour later. Eye examination findings after the attack are usually entirely normal.
In some cases, patients may also mistake transient binocular homonymous visual loss (see below) as being in one eye only.
Transient visual loss in both eyes simultaneously is most commonly caused by the binocular 'scintillating scotoma' that occurs before the onset of headache in many patients with migraine. This scotoma may sometimes occur in known migraine patients without headache (acephalgic migraine).
Scintillating scotoma is a homonymous scotoma (a dark area in the same position in each visual field, for example, the left part of the left eye's vision and the left part of the right eye's vision), bordered by zig-zag lines or flashing colored lights. The dark area slowly expands, and then usually disappears as the headache phase of the migraine starts. Scintillating scotomas are also occasionally produced by occipital seizures (including those due to a tumor or vascular malformation). Migraine rarely develops over the age of 50 without the patient having had at least one previous attack in earlier life.
Transient homonymous field loss or transient bilateral blindness (usually without zig-zags or flashing lights) can also occur in vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks, brief episodes of neurological disturbance caused by a reduced blood supply to the occipital lobes.
Papilledema (bilateral optic disc swelling due to raised intracranial pressure) can also cause fading out of vision in one or both eyes, usually for seconds at a time.","<BULL> Most patients with blurred vision have benign, slowly progressive conditions and can be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. However, blurred vision may also be the first symptom of potentially sight- or life-threatening disease, and patients suspected of having a serious cause of blurred vision must be referred urgently. <BULL> All people over 40 should be encouraged to have regular eye checks by their optometrist to look for early signs of glaucoma and other eye disease. Chronic glaucoma is usually asymptomatic until it is very advanced. <BULL> Please check that all your practice's diabetic patients are enrolled for regular eye screening to detect diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy is best treated at an asymptomatic stage to prevent visual loss. <BULL> Always consider temporal arteritis if a patient over 50 complains of sudden loss of vision or transient blurring of vision."," of vision, which is usually not noticed by the patient because peripheral vision is lost first. Central vision loss signifies severe disease and can occur if the condition is not detected early by routine population screening. Chronic glaucoma is common, and risk increases with age. People with a family history of glaucoma are at increased risk and may develop the disease at a younger age. The risk of developing the disease increases with age. The risk increases with the age of the patient and the risk of developing it increases with age.It is essential to be able to clinically triage your patients with blurred vision into the majority for whom routine written referral to an ophthalmologist is appropriate and the minority who require urgent referral (to be seen the same day). It is also important to be aware that patients with blurred vision are at increased risk of developing a degenerative eye disease (AMD). It is important to be aware of the risk of developing degenerative eye disease in patients with degenerative eye disease. The risk of degenerative eye disease is very high. It is also recommended to be aware of patients with degenerative eyes disease, such as diabetic retinopathy. It is important to note that there is no cure for this condition.Patients with monocular, embolic, transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) report a sudden loss of vision, as if a curtain comes down over their eye, followed by a spontaneous return of vision a few minutes to an hour later. It is not uncommon for patients to experience a sudden loss in vision. It is also uncommon for patients to have severe vision loss in one eye.It is not uncommon to see patients with severe vision loss. It is common to see patients with progressive vision loss (see below) as being in one eye only. It is rare to see patients who have severe vision loss.It is rare to see people with severe vision loss (Figure 3.5). It is rare to find patients with severe visual loss. It is also rare to see patients without severe vision loss. The most common cause of severe vision loss is:Acute optic neuropathy. In this condition, the optic nerve behind one or both eyes loses some or all of its capability to transmit impulses, resulting in blurred vision in the affected eye/s. The cardinal sign in all unilateral optic neuropathies is an RAPD on the swinging light test.It is rare for patients with severe vision to have severe vision. It is rare for patients who have severe visual loss to have severe visual loss"
9783318068207,hh-8,"Preparing high-quality samples
In the era of personalized medicine, tissue samples (histological or cytological specimens) acquire a central role not only for morphological evaluation but also for molecular analyses. In this setting, careful attention should be paid to pre-analytic factors that can adversely affect the quality and quantity of nucleic acids in the sample, leading to uninterpretable molecular results.
FFPE histological samples represent the gold standard starting material from which to extract nucleic acids for molecular analysis. FFPE specimens contain a high quantity of material for both morphological evaluation and ancillary techniques and do not require additional molecular validation, unlike cytological samples.
A prolonged fixation time in formalin should be avoided, as this can induce C>T artifacts. Such a change can mimic a mutation and may lead to a false-positive result. Other factors that may influence the integrity of nucleic acids include:
cold ischemia time (the time between biospecimen removal from the body and its preservation)
duration of storage of the paraffin block.
Data from the literature suggest some good-practice recommendations (Table 6.1).
Cytological preparations (direct smears and liquid-based cytology), in contrast to FFPE samples, do not suffer the histological issues related to formalin fixation (cytological specimens are air dried or alcohol fixed), cold ischemia or paraffin storage (Table 6.2). Direct smears are suitable for rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) when fine needle aspiration (FNA) is performed. This procedure supports the correct management of aspirated material for morphomolecular analysis. In addition, the possibility of targeting a neoplastic lesion with the fine needle allows cancer cell enrichment and avoids contamination with non-neoplastic elements.
The major limitation of cytological samples is the necessity for careful validation of techniques before they are implemented in clinical practice. Moreover, despite the high-quality sampling of nucleic acids, these preparations have low quantities of material available for analysis and there is a high risk that diagnostic material will be lost.
Cell blocks are cytological preparations that resemble histological samples. The aspirated material is processed in FFPE format. Consequently, cell blocks have advantages and disadvantages similar to those of histological samples.
How to report
Molecular reports are a crucial part of molecular laboratories' workflow. They should contain all relevant information to support the clinician's management of the patient, particularly regarding the best treatment choice., For this reason, the communication should be accurate and avoid any misinterpretation by molecular pathologists or clinicians, particularly oncologists or other physicians who request the molecular analysis.
Incomplete or difficult to understand reports may lead to errors in patient management. Molecular reports should be short and easy to interpret, focusing on the main information that could be of interest for the patient's clinical management. All reports should show the patient's unique identifiers (name, surname, date of birth and identification number). In addition, it is important to report the:
ward or service
sample type
name of the clinician who requested the molecular analysis.
The body of the text should report, in a brief and clear manner, the main characteristics of samples (percentage of neoplastic cells, fixation problems, presence of contaminant that can limit the analysis) and the information regarding the mutational status of the analyzed biomarkers.
As recommended by the AMP, ASCO and CAP, a four-tiered system for the interpretation and reporting of variants in cancer should be adopted, in particular when tested using large NGS panels (Table 6.3).
According to the guidance from the professional bodies, tiers I-III variants should be reported, but it is not always necessary to report tier IV variants. Mutations should be reported using Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature and following the scheme gene, p. (protein reference sequence) and c. (coding DNA reference sequence) annotations (for example, KRAS p.G12D c.35G>A). Gene rearrangements should be reported by indicating both genes involved (for example, EML4 / ALK fusion). CNVs detected by NGS should be reported as copy number 'GAIN' or 'LOSS' (for example, EGFR copy number GAIN [copy number ratio 25]). It is important to indicate, where possible, the variant allelic frequency and coverage of detected alterations.
It is also important to report as 'wild type' the absence of mutations in clinically relevant genes (tier I).
The report should contain a clinical interpretation of the detected variants to suggest treatment options, with literature citations where possible. Information about the methods - the type of test adopted, the reference range, the limit of detection (LOD) and the NGS parameters applied - should be included at the end of the report.
Building knowledge
The increasing knowledge about genomic alterations involved in cancer development and the technological improvements represent a serious challenge for physicians making decisions about cancer treatment. In particular, clinicians may have had limited training in molecular biology while molecular pathologists may have low awareness of clinical management. To overcome these limitations, it is very important that challenging cases are brought to, and discussed by, MTBs.
Molecular tumor boards are multidisciplinary groups of professionals involved in the management of cancer patients, such as molecular pathologists, clinicians, surgeons, radiologists, geneticists, bioinformaticians and biologists. There are 6-40 members at each meeting.
At each meeting, the MTB discusses the correct management of individual cancer patients. It is the role of the MTB to decipher the complexity of the cancer genomic landscape and translate it into information useful for patient management.
Although there are no guideline recommendations, the MTB should meet at least weekly to discuss cases, especially when particular issues emerge. As well as therapeutic strategies, the meeting provides an opportunity to solve other kinds of problems, such as the type of sample that should be analyzed, the molecular technique and gene panel that should be adopted and the interpretation of molecular results, which is particularly important when unclear or doubtful data have been reported.
Owing to the complexity of each cancer patient, MTBs generally discuss two or three patients per meeting. In the absence of guidelines, van der Velden et al. propose recommendations to optimize and facilitate the MTB function. First, there should be global harmonization in cancer sequencing practices and procedures. Second, MTBs should comprise, as a minimum, clinicians (all specialists involved in the patient's cancer management), pathologists (including molecular pathologists), biologists, geneticists (particularly when considering the presence of germline variants) and bioinformaticians. Finally, MTBs should set out how they will handle unsolicited findings, in particular regarding germline variants.
Costs/reimbursement
Costs and reimbursements are crucially important for molecular pathology laboratories offering predictive assays. Owing to a high workload and the necessity of orthogonal technologies (validation process and confirmation of mutational results), laboratories may implement two or more different platforms.
Costs. Malapelle et al., in a validation study, demonstrated that the costs of NGS were affordable compared with Sanger sequencing (the gold standard). In this study, patients with advanced CRC were analyzed for clinically relevant mutations in KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4 and BRAF exon 15. As far as consumable costs are concerned, Sanger sequencing (a single-gene test) cost at least €28 per reaction, giving a total cost of €196 for the analysis of seven exons. With NGS testing using the Ion Torrent platform (see page 34), 504 mutational hotspot regions in 22 genes can be tested simultaneously for 8 patients using a single 316 chip. In this case, the cost for each patient's analysis was calculated as €187.23.
In another study, Malapelle et al. reported that the cost of NGS analysis could be reduced by adopting a narrow custom gene panel covering 568 hotspot mutations in six genes (EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, KIT and PDGFRA). In addition, the protocol was optimized to run 16 patient samples in a single 316 chip. These modifications reduced the cost to €98 per sample, similar to the cost of a traditional RT-PCR test.
Reimbursement. Besides the different gene panels and platforms, it is important to consider the healthcare system in which these technologies are adopted and the reimbursement system for molecular tests.
If there is a well-resourced reimbursement-based system, insurance coverage can guarantee the refund of the cost of wide tumor sequencing. In this setting, NGS is fully adopted as a 'one-stop-shop' for all biomarkers.
If there is universal healthcare, resources are limited. Careful attention should be paid to ensuring that the molecular data that can represent the standard of care for cancer patients, at the very least, can be gained. In addition, costs rise if a large number of laboratories perform molecular tests on a relatively low number of samples. In this setting, it may be helpful to centralize NGS to make it viable.",<BULL> Different sample types (histological or cytological) have distinct advantages and disadvantages; these are a key issue in molecular analysis. <BULL> Standardization in molecular reporting is very important. <BULL> Discussing a patient's results and management at an MTB meeting may help to overcome challenging issues. <BULL> Laboratories should pay careful attention to costs and reimbursement systems for molecular analysis.,"Preparing high-quality samples for molecular analysis.In the era of personalized medicine, tissue samples (histological or cytological specimens) acquire a central role not only for morphological evaluation but also for molecular analyses.

Familial brain tumor syndromes
The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial. The etiology of sporadic brain tumors is unknown, but environmental factors are suspected. Most patients with a family history of primary brain tumors have a hereditary disease that is known to be associated with such tumors, such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, familial polyposis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome. However, some patients do not have any underlying or obvious hereditary disorder that would predispose them to primary brain tumors, but nevertheless give a striking history of these tumors in first-degree relatives. Usually, the tumors are found to be high-grade gliomas.
Although it is feasible that germline abnormalities could lead to the development of primary brain tumors in these families, there are a number of unusual demographic features suggesting an environmental rather than genetic explanation for brain tumor clustering. Most cases of confirmed familial cancers are multigenerational, and affected individuals are younger than average for the tumor. However, brain tumor families who do not have one of the recognized hereditary diseases usually involve parent-child and sibling-sibling cases; it is rare for more than two generations to be involved. In addition, the demographics suggest environmental rather than genetic causes in the parent-child and sibling-sibling clusters. These observations suggest that familial exposure to an environmental toxin or ionizing radiation may account for the clustering of primary brain tumors in these families.
It is important for clinicians to enquire about any family history of brain tumors, and to be aware of the major syndromes with neoplastic manifestations in the nervous system, so that these diagnoses are not missed. Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate patient surveillance for another occult brain tumor or associated disease, for screening family members, and for genetic counseling. Most patients presenting with primary brain tumors will, however, be sporadic cases and the etiology will remain unknown.
Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 3500. However, this disease can occur sporadically, with up to 50% of cases arising as spontaneous mutations. The gene responsible for this disorder, NF1, is located on chromosome 17q12 and encodes a protein, neurofibromin, important in intracellular signaling. Diagnosis requires the presence of two or more of the following features:
six or more café au lait spots
two or more neurofibromas or one plexiform neurofibroma
axillary or inguinal freckling
optic nerve glioma
characteristic osseous lesions
a first-degree relative with neurofibromatosis type 1.
The major neoplastic neurological manifestations of this disorder are optic nerve glioma, astrocytoma and glioblastoma. The main non-neoplastic neurological features are seizures, cognitive impairment and hydrocephalus (Figure 11.1).
Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal dominant disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 40 000. The gene responsible for this disorder, NF2, is located on 22q12. This gene codes for a protein known as merlin or schwannomin that is thought to have a tumor suppressive function. Approximately half of all cases of neurofibromatosis type 2 are due to spontaneous genetic mutations. For a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2 to be made, specific features must be identified:
bilateral vestibular hamartomas, or
a first-degree relative with neurofibromatosis type 2, in combination either with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma or with at least two of the following: meningioma, glioma, schwannoma, neurofibroma, posterior subcapsular lens opacity or cerebral calcification, or
two of the following:
unilateral vestibular schwannoma
multiple meningiomas
any one of schwannoma, neurofibroma, glioma, posterior subcapsular lens opacity or cerebral calcification.
The major neoplastic neurological manifestations are schwannoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, ependymoma and glial hamartoma, while the principal non-neoplastic neurological manifestation is cerebral calcifications (Figure 11.2).
Management of complications related to neurofibromatosis type 2 is almost universally surgical, but recent trials using the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab for acoustic schwannomas have demonstrated regression of these tumors. Some patients experienced improvement in hearing as well. Further research is warranted before this treatment can be recommended for patients with neurofibromatosis type 2.
Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an inherited autosomal dominant disorder and is extremely rare. The gene responsible for this disease, VHL, is located on 3p25-26. The diagnostic criteria are:
capillary hemangioblastoma in the central nervous system (CNS) or retina, and either
one of the following tumors: renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenomas or islet cell tumors, pheochromocytomas, epididymal cystadenomas or endolymphatic sac tumor, or
a first-degree relative with Von Hippel-Lindau disease.
The major neoplastic neurological manifestation is hemangioblastoma of the CNS; there are no non-neoplastic neurological manifestations (Figure 11.3).
Tuberous sclerosis is a group of autosomal dominant disorders, with an incidence between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 10 000. This disorder is caused by mutations of the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that encode proteins important in intracellular signaling.
The diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis are:
presence of hamartomas involving the skin, nervous system, retina, heart and kidneys (definite criterion)
multiple cutaneous angiofibromas (probable criterion).
Neoplastic neurological manifestations include subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and retinal giant cell astrocytoma. Non-neoplastic neurological features are subependymal nodule, cortical tuber, white matter hamartoma and retinal hamartoma.
Advances in our understanding of the aberrant signaling cascades that result from mutations of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes have resulted in remarkable preliminary results using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus, where regression of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and cortical tubers have been noted. This class of drugs has great potential to alter the clinical manifestations and outcome of this disease.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which there is an increased risk of multiple tumors developing in children and young adults, including breast cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas and primary brain tumors. The incidence of the disorder has not been established, but it is known to be due to a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 on 17p13.
The diagnostic criteria are:
occurrence of a sarcoma before the age of 45 years, and either
at least one first-degree relative with any tumor before age 45, or
a second- or first-degree relative with cancer before the age of 45 or a sarcoma at any age.
Neoplastic neurological manifestations of the disease are glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, low-grade astrocytoma, oligoastrocytoma, medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor. There are no non-neoplastic manifestations.
Turcot syndrome comprises a group of autosomal dominant, and possibly also recessive, disorders characterized by multiple colorectal neoplasms and malignant neuroepithelial tumors. Multiple genes are implicated, including APC on 5q21, hMLH1 on 3p21.3, and hPMS2 on 7p22. The incidence of this syndrome is unknown.
Diagnosis requires the coexistence of primary brain and colon tumors. There are two distinct syndromes:
medulloblastomas arising in the setting of familial adenomatous polyposis and involving germline mutations of the APC gene
glioblastoma arising in the setting of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma and involving mutations of DNA mismatch repair genes hMLH1 and hPMS2.
The neoplastic neurological manifestations of the syndrome are glioblastoma and medulloblastoma; there are no non-neoplastic manifestations.
Tumor-like cysts
Several types of lesion, often cystic in nature, may be mistaken for a primary intracranial tumor and must therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of suggestive MRI abnormalities (Table 11.1).
Dermoid and epidermoid cysts account for about 1% of intracranial tumors and are most often found at the base of the brain, fourth ventricle or spine. They are midline tumors that arise from fetal neural and ectodermal tissues. There may be direct communication with the skin via a midline dermal tract.
In addition to the typical midline location, epidermoid cysts may arise in the lateral skull, cerebellopontine angle or ear (cholesteatoma). They present more often in adults than children, and are three to four times more common than dermoids. They consist primarily of a keratinized squamous epithelium (Figure 11.4). MRI scans of an epidermoid cyst will demonstrate characteristic restricted diffusion with no suppression on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.
Dermoid cysts are distinguished from epidermoid cysts by the presence of dermal appendages (hair, teeth, adnexa and fat) in addition to keratinized squamous epithelium (Figure 11.5). They are more likely to have a dermal sinus tract. These lesions typically present in childhood.
Both types of lesion slowly expand as a result of epithelial turnover; dermoid cysts may expand more rapidly as a result of secretions. Symptoms may arise secondary to mass effect or, in some cases, spontaneous rupture or leakage may result in aseptic meningitis. Patients who have recurrent aseptic meningitis should therefore be evaluated for a dermoid or epidermoid cyst. Disseminated fat droplets in the subarachnoid space or ventricular system are diagnostic for a ruptured dermoid cyst.
Treatment is resection. Intraoperative leakage of cyst contents may cause cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis or secondary hydrocephalus due to obstruction of arachnoid granulations. Complete resection may be more difficult to achieve for epidermoids than for dermoids. Subtotal resection is appropriate when total resection is not feasible.
Colloid cysts of the third ventricle are sessile masses attached to the choroid plexus at the foramen of Munro (Figure 11.6). They cause obstructive hydrocephalus, which often presents with intermittent symptoms attributed to transient increases in intracranial pressure, referred to as 'plateau waves'.
Previously, these lesions were thought to cause intermittent symptoms by a ball-valve mechanism that caused intermittent obstruction of the foramen of Munro with changes in posture. However, it is now known that the attachment to the choroid plexus is fixed and does not move.
Patients who are experiencing symptoms should have the cyst resected; often, an endoscopic approach is used to achieve safe removal. Ventriculoperitoneal shunts are best avoided in these patients; both lateral ventricles may require independent shunting and obstruction rates are high. It is safe to follow asymptomatic patients radiographically.
Rathke cleft cysts are usually small asymptomatic abnormalities found on MRI. They can arise in either the sellar or suprasellar region, with 70% of these cysts bridging these two compartments. The lack of calcification may help to distinguish these cysts from craniopharyngiomas. Rarely, Rathke cleft cysts cause pituitary dysfunction, headache or visual disturbance; in these cases, surgical resection is appropriate. Recurrence is rare.
Arachnoid cysts are congenital malformations that are typically found in a superficial location, but may be intraventricular (Figure 11.7). They are usually asymptomatic, but occasionally have sufficient mass effect to cause headaches or seizures. Symptomatic lesions should be surgically drained.
Neurenteric cysts are congenital epithelial cysts that occur in the spinal canal or posterior fossa. Most are asymptomatic; those causing compression or obstructing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be resected or diverted.","<BULL> There are several syndromes associated with an inherited predisposition to a variety of brain tumors.

9781910797105,ch05,"Developmental theories and environmental factors
Is schizophrenia a degenerative brain disorder, as originally thought by Kraepelin, or is it better viewed as non-progressive?
During the 1990s, much attention was given to the 'neurodevelopmental hypothesis' of schizophrenia. On the basis of the range of observations outlined in Table 5.1, it was suggested that a static lesion, either genetic or environmental in origin during brain development, expressed its effects as a function of the maturational stage of the brain. In schizophrenia, the characteristic symptoms emerge only during the final stages of brain development in adolescence, when normal 'pruning' or elimination of excess synapses takes place. It is now known that schizophrenia results in part from a developmentally regulated disconnection of higher order association areas, through alterations in neuronal migration, synapse formation and myelination.
Neurodevelopmental risk factors
Some established risk factors act early in life (Table 5.2). Obstetric complications generally appear to increase the risk of schizophrenia. During pregnancy, risk factors include rubella and influenza infections in the first or second trimester and antepartum bleeding. Asphyxia and low birth weight, especially with intrauterine growth retardation, are risk factors at birth, as are certain brain insults and infections in childhood.
Early developmental delays
Longitudinal follow-up studies of large birth cohorts have shown that the 1-2% of the sample who go on to develop adult schizophrenia show slight delays in motor, speech and intellectual milestones compared with the rest of the cohort. These differences are subtle, such as walking being delayed by 1-2 months. Certain problems, such as developmental receptive language disorders, are particularly linked to later schizophrenia. These developmental delays do not occur in bipolar disorder.
Secondary schizophrenias
The so-called secondary schizophrenias fit less easily into the neurodevelopmental formulation. The psychotic symptoms in these cases appear to be caused by a primary organic disorder, either a known physical disorder or a clinically unsuspected brain lesion.
Table 5.3 lists those medical conditions in which a clear or possible association with schizophrenia-like disorders has been reported. Antineuronal cell surface antibody disorders involving the N -methyl- D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor can present with psychosis, which responds to immunotherapy. These disorders are more common than previously realized, accounting for perhaps 2-3% of first-onset cases.
Clinically recommended screening investigations for first-episode schizophrenia are outlined in Table 5.4.
Street-drug use
Use of cannabis and amphetamine-like drugs has long been known to be an important trigger of relapse, but had not been thought to directly cause the onset of illness. However, several cohort studies since 2000 have shown that use of cannabis doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia.
The risk is further increased if minor psychotic symptoms pre-exist and if cannabis use starts early in adolescence. Research suggests that this effect of cannabis may be mediated by a particular gene. Those with a specific version of the catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene, carried by about a quarter of the general population, appear to be especially prone to psychosis after cannabis use. Delta-9-THC, the active component of cannabis, disrupts learning and recall in schizophrenia.
Psychosocial risk factors

On the basis of the range of observations outlined in Table 5.1, it was suggested that a static lesion, either genetic or environmental in origin during brain development, expressed its effects as a function of the maturational stage of the brain. In schizophrenia, the characteristic symptoms emerge only during the final stages of brain development in adolescence, when normal 'pruning' or elimination of excess synapses takes place. It is now known that schizophrenia results in part from a developmentally regulated disconnection of higher order association areas, through alterations in neuronal migration, synapse formation and myelination. [ edit ]Neurodevelopmental risk factors [ edit ]Some established risk factors act early in life (Table 5.2). Obstetric complications generally appear to increase the risk of schizophrenia. During pregnancy, risk factors include rubella and influenza infections in the first or second trimester and antepartum bleeding. Asphyxia and low birth weight, especially with intrauterine growth retardation, are risk factors at birth, as are certain brain insults and infections in childhood. [ edit ] [ edit ]Early developmental delays [ edit ]Longitudinal follow-up studies of large birth cohorts have shown that the 1-2% of the sample who go on to develop adult schizophrenia show slight delays in motor, speech and intellectual milestones compared with the rest of the cohort. These differences are subtle, such as rubella and flu infections in the first and second trimester and acute epartum bleeding. In addition, there is a high risk of developing schizophrenia in the second trimester and in the third trimester. [ edit ]The so-called secondary schizophrenias fit less easily into the neurodevelopmental formulation. The psychotic symptoms in these cases appear to be caused by a primary organic disorder, either a known physical disorder or a clinically unsuspected brain lesion. [ edit ]Clinically recommended screening investigations for first-onset schizophrenia have shown that 1-2 months of first-episode schizophrenia show slight delays, such as walking being delayed by 1-2 months. Certain problems, such as developmental receptive language disorders, are particularly linked to later schizophrenia. These developmental delays do not occur in bipolar disorder.

9781908541420,ch_6,"Successful asthma management will achieve both control of symptoms and prevention of acute attacks (Table 4.1). To achieve this, preventive measures including the use of medication to prevent symptoms to treat acute attacks is necessary. Avoidance of triggers where possible can also be important (see allergen avoidance in Chapter 6). Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (also called preventers) and relievers.
Controllers (preventers) are taken daily over the long term to control persistent asthma (Table 4.2). They include anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, sodium cromoglicate, nedocromil sodium and leukotriene modifiers, and long-acting bronchodilators such as long-acting beta -agonists (LABAs), omalizumab and sustained-release theophylline.
Inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclometasone (beclomethasone) dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone, fluticasone furoate and ciclesonide, are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents currently available for asthma management. They are the mainstay of effective asthma treatment, improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths. Studies have consistently shown that these agents reduce pathological signs of airway inflammation, so that lung function and symptoms improve, bronchial hyperresponsiveness decreases, and the frequency and severity of exacerbations are reduced. Corticosteroids interrupt the signaling pathways for pro-inflammatory molecules by decreasing the expression of genes for a variety of inflammatory mediators and by increasing the expression of genes for anti-inflammatory mediators.
Inhaled corticosteroids are also useful in the treatment of persistent asthma because they reduce the need for oral corticosteroids and have fewer systemic adverse effects. Local adverse effects, which include oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia and coughing, can largely be prevented by using spacer devices and mouth rinsing after use. Potential systemic adverse effects include thinning of the skin, cataract formation, adrenal suppression and decreased bone metabolism and growth. The risk of such effects depends on a number of factors, including the dose taken, absorption from the gut or lung, the extent of first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver, and the half-life of the corticosteroid. In general, the risk of significant systemic effects is low with therapeutic doses.
The recommended doses of inhaled corticosteroids depend on the type of medication and inhaler used. By convention, inhaled corticosteroid doses are presented as equivalent doses of beclometasone dipropionate. It is also evident that the majority of benefits of inhaled corticosteroids are achieved at low to medium doses, with the risks of inhaled corticosteroid medication increasing at higher doses.
Systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, can be given either orally or parenterally. Short courses (3-7 days) can be used when starting therapy in patients with uncontrolled asthma or during periods of worsening asthma. Long-term treatment may rarely be necessary in patients with severe persistent asthma; patients who require such medication should be seen by a specialist. Systemic events associated with oral corticosteroids include impairment of growth in children, osteoporosis, arterial hypertension, adrenal suppression, obesity, thinning of the skin, muscle weakness, cataract formation and diabetes. It should be noted that long-term inhaled corticosteroid therapy is far safer than oral or parenteral corticosteroid therapy.
Leukotriene modifiers. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) - LTC, LTD, and LTE, - are potent mediators of asthma. They are generated from arachidonic acid by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway that operates in mast cells and eosinophils. Once known as 'slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis', cysLTs released during the inflammatory process cause prolonged contraction of smooth muscle, microvascular leakage, mucus secretion and eosinophil attraction. As the structure of the leukotrienes was elucidated in 1979, a number of leukotriene-modifying drugs have been developed and introduced into the market. Zafirlukast, montelukast and pranlukast are anti-asthma drugs that inhibit the effect of leukotrienes at their receptor (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, cysLTR1). In addition, inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase, such as zileuton, interrupt the conversion of arachidonic acid into leukotrienes, including the cysLTs and LTB4.
Treatment with one of these oral drugs can produce improvement in pulmonary function, protection from exercise-induced asthma and reduced eosinophilic inflammation. A clinical response is usually seen within 3 weeks of therapy, though not all patients benefit. Patients with asthma associated with intolerance to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seem to be particularly responsive.
Leukotriene modifiers can be used to treat mild persistent asthma, especially in children for whom the use of inhaled corticosteroids is limited because of concerns regarding the effects on growth. However, these drugs are less effective overall than a low dose of inhaled corticosteroid. They can also be used together with an inhaled corticosteroid in moderate and severe asthma, but are less effective than the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an inhaled LABA. Clearly, the advantages of these drugs over other long-term controllers (preventers) are that they are orally administered and are not corticosteroids; patient acceptability and adherence is therefore likely to be good.
Sodium cromoglicate and nedocromil sodium. Inhaled sodium cromoglicate and nedocromil sodium inhibit allergen-induced airflow limitation and acute airflow limitation after exercise or exposure to cold air or sulfur dioxide. They work by stabilizing mast cells and sensory nerves by stimulating the newly identified GP receptor 35. Each agent can be used as long-term therapy early in the course of asthma; a course of 4-6 weeks may be needed to determine effectiveness in a given patient. Adverse effects are few, though coughing may result from inhalation of the powder formulation. Both agents can be used as maintenance therapy for asthma but are less effective than a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids. As these agents have few side effects, they have found particular use in childhood asthma.
Sustained-release theophylline. Theophylline is a bronchodilator, and there is some evidence that it may also have anti-inflammatory effects. It is both an inhibitor of cyclic adenosine 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase and an antagonist of adenosine purinoreceptors. During long-term treatment, sustained-release theophylline controls symptoms and improves lung function. Because of its long duration of action, it is useful in controlling nocturnal symptoms that persist despite regular anti-inflammatory treatment. However, theophylline has a number of potentially serious adverse effects (Table 4.3); theophylline intoxication can result in seizures and death. Furthermore, the drug has a relatively narrow therapeutic index; serum concentrations producing adverse effects are close to those required for therapeutic efficacy. Appropriate dosing and monitoring are therefore essential; in general, dosing should produce a steady-state serum theophylline concentration of 5-15 µg/mL. Monitoring is advisable when treatment is started and at regular intervals thereafter. In addition, serum drug concentrations should be monitored if:
adverse events occur with the usual dose
the expected therapeutic benefit is not achieved
the patient has a condition that is likely to affect theophylline metabolism (exempli gratia febrile illness, pregnancy, liver disease, congestive heart failure)
the patient is receiving concomitant treatment with drugs that interact with theophylline (exempli gratia cimetidine, some quinolone antibiotics).
Long-acting beta -agonists such as salmeterol xinafoate and formoterol fumarate dihydrate, have a duration of action of more than 12 hours. They act by relaxing airway smooth muscle, enhancing mucociliary clearance and decreasing vascular permeability; in addition, they may modulate mediator release from mast cells and basophils. Long-term treatment with inhaled preparations of LABAs improves symptoms and lung function, relieves nocturnal asthma and reduces the need for short-acting beta -agonists (SABAs). Such preparations can be used as a more effective alternative to increasing the corticosteroid dose in patients for whom standard starting doses of inhaled corticosteroids do not control symptoms. A LABA should not be given without an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma as studies have suggested this to be associated with an increase in mortality. Combination therapies of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs are now widely used (see page 60). Adverse events associated with LABAs include cardiovascular stimulation, anxiety, heartburn and tremor.
Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG anti-IgE antibody, which is administered every 2-4 weeks by subcutaneous injection. The dose is titrated according to body weight and the serum level of total IgE. It binds to the part of the IgE molecule that attaches to the high-affinity and low-affinity receptors on mediator-secreting cells, thereby depriving the cells of the necessary allergen-specific IgE required to trigger secretion of mediators. The net result is that the serum level of free IgE drops steeply with the first injection and then gradually, over several weeks, IgE in the airways also falls, followed by downregulation of IgE receptors. Generally, an effect is observed after 4-6 months of treatment with attenuation of both early- and late-phase allergen-induced bronchoconstriction in parallel with a reduction in airway inflammation, including a decrease in airway eosinophils.
Clinical trials have revealed that this anti-allergy treatment is effective in treating allergic asthma. The availability of omalizumab is limited by its expense, but the drug is considered cost-effective in the management of severe and chronic asthma, particularly in reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations. Currently, omalizumab is listed as appropriate for Step 5 asthma treatment (from GINA guidelines, see Figure 4.6): that is, for patients who have poorly controlled asthma despite maximal doses of inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs. In order to avoid non-responsive patients receiving omalizumab, a 16-week trial of therapy is recommended, after which the clinician is asked to assess responsiveness using multiple endpoints. The major side effect of this drug has been the uncommon occurrence of anaphylaxis and severe asthma episodes following administration, which can occur several hours after the injection. Consequently, most treatment guidelines recommend observing the patient for 1-2 hours after administration and provision of an anaphylaxis plan and an epinephrine (adrenaline) auto-injector for patients to take home with them.
Reliever medications
Relievers (sometimes referred to as rescue medication) are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks (see Table 4.2). They include SABAs, LABAs with a rapid onset of action, short-acting theophylline and short-acting anticholinergic agents. The most effective forms are those that are delivered by inhalation directly to the airways.
Short-acting beta -agonists. Inhaled SABAs, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, are used to control bronchoconstriction, and are the treatment of choice for the management of acute exacerbations and the prophylaxis of exercise-induced asthma. Oral preparations are also available and may be suitable for patients who are unable to use inhaled medication. In general, oral administration is less desirable than inhaled administration because systemic side effects such as tachycardia are more pronounced when the drug is delivered orally.
Concern has been expressed over the long-term safety of repeatedly inhaling short-acting beta -bronchodilators. Several points are worth making in relation to the use of these quick relievers. They are certainly the best drugs for relieving acute bronchospasm and associated symptoms, but their increased use by a patient is a sign of worsening asthma and the need for greater use of controller (preventer) drugs. The use of one canister of a metered-dose inhaler per month should certainly sound alarm bells. Regular use of SABAs is not recommended, as a refractory response may develop, and it has been suggested that asthma may worsen. In addition, it is now known that genetic beta -adrenoceptor polymorphisms influence the effectiveness of these drugs, particularly with regard to tachyphylaxis or the development of refractoriness; therefore SABAs should only be used for quick relief on an 'as-required' basis.
Long-acting beta -agonists with a rapid onset of action (exempli gratia formoterol) can be used as bronchodilators to treat acute asthma symptoms. Because of the concerns regarding the use of a LABA without an inhaled corticosteroid, this form of therapy is usually provided in an inhaler combined with an inhaled corticosteroid.
Systemic corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroid preparations have a relatively slow onset of action (4-6 hours), but are extremely useful in the treatment of severe acute exacerbations because they prevent progression of the exacerbation. As a result, they also reduce the need for emergency treatment or hospitalization, prevent early relapse and reduce the morbidity associated with exacerbations. Treatment is normally continued for 3-10 days after the exacerbation; the dose can be reduced and stopped as symptoms resolve and lung function returns to the personal best level.
Anticholinergic agents. Inhaled anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium bromide or oxitropium bromide cause bronchodilatation by inhibiting postganglionic efferent vagal fibers, thereby reducing the vagal tone of the airways. They also inhibit reflex bronchoconstriction provoked by inhaled irritants. They are less effective than inhaled beta -agonists and have a slower onset of action, taking 30-60 minutes to reach their maximum effect. They are particularly useful when administered as a nebulized aqueous aerosol in acute severe asthma exacerbations and as long-term therapy for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adverse effects include dry mouth and a bad taste.
Short-acting theophylline. Oral treatment with short-acting theophylline has been used for pretreatment of exercise-induced asthma and for symptomatic relief. The role of theophylline in the treatment of exacerbations is controversial and, because of the high risk of adverse effects and the slow onset of action, it is now rarely used in developed countries except for acute severe life-threatening asthma.
Combination therapy. A series of clinical trials have shown that the inhaled LABAs salmeterol and formoterol, when administered to patients who are already taking inhaled corticosteroids but whose asthma is poorly controlled, may produce greater improvements in pulmonary function and symptom control than would be obtained by doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. Combinations of an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA - specifically, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol and fluticasone propionate and formoterol - are now available in single inhalers. The addition of a LABA is indicated for all whose asthma fails to be controlled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid. It would seem, therefore, that the dose-response curve for topical corticosteroids is not linear, and that the overall benefits obtained with doses of up to approximately 400 µg HFA-beclometasone dipropionate per day or equivalent are as great as those that can be achieved with further increments (HFA refers to the propellant hydrofluoroalkane-134a). One possible explanation for these observations is that topical corticosteroids are able to control the inflammatory response by inhibiting cytokine and other relevant pathways. They are not able to alter, at least in the short and medium term, the behavior of the remodeled airway with its increased smooth muscle, microvasculature and thickened airway walls. In this situation, drugs that act on the airway smooth muscle and microvasculature to restore airway physiology to normal, such as a LABA, are likely to be effective.
All controller and reliever combination medications are indicated to be taken regularly, usually twice daily, as a preventative for asthma exacerbation and to control the underlying airway inflammation characteristic of asthma.
The formulation of budesonide and formoterol combination treatment can be used as a single inhaler to deliver both maintenance preventive treatment as well as being used as a reliever. This means patients have only one inhaler for both their controller and reliever therapy. Some trials indicate that this approach can be effective in preventing exacerbations as patients will receive increased inhaled corticosteroid as well as bronchodilator therapy at the first sign of worsening symptoms as they use their reliever medications. Currently, the only single inhaler approach to demonstrate effective regular preventer and as-needed reliever therapy in clinical studies is the budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler as formoterol (unlike salmeterol) has a rapid onset of action, enabling its use as a reliever medication in a single-inhaler treatment plan.
Delivery of inhaled medication
Inhalation of aerosols or powders achieves high drug concentrations in the airways and reduces the risk of systemic adverse effects. A variety of delivery devices are available (Table 4.4). Whichever device is chosen, its use should be explained carefully to the patient (Figures 4.1 and 4.2), and the patient's technique checked regularly.
Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) are the most widely used type of inhaler, delivering a measured dose of medication. Delivery is efficient when the device is used correctly (see Figure 4.1).
Many patients, however, are unable to coordinate inspiration with inhaler actuation. The use of a spacer device (Figures 4.3 - 4.5) can overcome this problem and also reduces oropharyngeal deposition of drug and the incidence of local side effects. The use of a spacer for delivery of all medication through a pMDI, especially controller therapy, is recommended. The medication is discharged into the spacer and held in suspension for several seconds. During this time, the patient can inhale the drug in one or several breaths, without the need to coordinate inspiration and drug delivery; this may be particularly useful in small children and patients with poor coordination. A small-volume spacer can be adapted with a face mask for young children. The use of spacers also allows high doses to be given during attacks, eight to 12 puffs of reliever medication in a pMDI being indicated
Some pMDIs are constituted to release very fine particles on activation of the inhaler, and thus achieve improved drug deposition and efficacy, especially to the periphery of the lung. This increases systemic bioavailability from lung absorption and consequently increases the risk of side effects unless the dose is adjusted accordingly.
Breath-actuated inhalers, in which the valve is actuated during inspiration, are useful in patients who have difficulty coordinating actuation and breathing. Drug deposition appears to be greater than with pMDIs.
Dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) require a different inhalation technique from that needed with pMDIs. No propellant is needed because the drug is released by inspiratory airflow. However, a certain minimum flow rate is required, and thus these devices may be less effective in young children, during severe attacks and in those with very poor lung function. Inhalation of dry particles can cause coughing.
Nebulizers generate a wet aerosol by blowing compressed air through a drug solution or suspension, or by ultrasonic vibration. The patient inhales the aerosol through a face mask or mouthpiece. Nebulizers have largely been replaced in emergency settings and for young children by pMDIs and spacers, which have demonstrated equivalent drug delivery. This removes the need to purchase a nebulizer and air pump, and avoids the problems of portability of this equipment in an emergency or to remote settings. Nebulized therapy is still used for those with very severe lung disease or extreme attacks. A standard dose of nebulized beta -agonist is equivalent to eight to 12 puffs from a pMDI and spacer.
Asthma control
There are two broad aims of asthma control. The first is to reduce or eliminate asthma symptoms or the limitations of activities due to asthma. Key elements in assessing asthma control include the presence of symptoms both by day and night, the requirement for reliever medication and lung function or peak flow measurements. While assessment of symptoms can occur in the process of a clinical consultation, questionnaires have been developed to reliably measure asthma control, such as the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) or the Asthma Control Test (ACT). These can be used by both clinicians and patients to gain a reliable and longitudinal record of control of symptoms (Table 4.5).
The second aim of asthma control is prevention of exacerbations. While achieving control of asthma symptoms is likely to lead to prevention of exacerbations in most, for some patients asthma exacerbations are the predominant feature of their asthma. As asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening and are inevitably disruptive to patients and their carers, in these instances prevention of exacerbations should be the major focus of treatment. Factors indicating a high risk for future exacerbations include a past history of severe or life-threatening asthma attack, exacerbation occurring despite adequate preventative treatment, impaired interval lung function and cigarette smoke exposure.
Current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma treatment, depending on disease control (Table 4.5), in both adults and children (Figure 4.6). All patients should aim to have well-controlled asthma, and treatment should be stepped up or down, as appropriate, every 1-3 months to achieve and maintain asthma control.
Recommended management strategies suggest five treatment steps. Patients should be started on therapy appropriate to the initial level of symptoms: step 2 is appropriate for most patients who are receiving no, or only as-needed, bronchodilator treatment for asthma, and step 3 is appropriate for those with more uncontrolled symptoms and reduced lung function at the start of treatment.
Depending on symptom severity and the presence of exacerbations, treatment should be continued at a given level for 1-3 months before considering escalation or reduction. Generally, after 3 months of well-controlled asthma a step down to a lower level of treatment should be considered.
Step 1 is indicated for asthma with infrequent symptoms (less than twice a week) and normal interval lung function. For these patients, an inhaled as-needed SABA may be appropriate therapy without a regular controller treatment. Such patients can still experience exacerbations and the intensity of treatment for exacerbations should depend on the severity of the exacerbation (see Chapter 5).
Step 2 is usually indicated for initial treatment in those who have moderate symptoms. It involves the regular use of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid medication (Table 4.6) in addition to a rapidly acting beta -agonist for symptom relief as needed. The dose of inhaled corticosteroid at this level would range from 200 to 500 µg daily of beclometasone or equivalent medication in adults, and 100 to 200 µg daily in children. While the best available evidence supports inhaled corticosteroids for asthma treatment at this level for prevention of exacerbations and symptom control, leukotriene modifiers are an alternative at this treatment step. Leukotriene modifier medication is particularly favored in children for whom the dose of inhaled corticosteroid needs to be minimized, although existing evidence suggests that leukotriene modifier medication is less effective in preventing exacerbations than low-dose inhaled corticosteroid medication.
Step 3. Patients who still have symptoms of uncontrolled asthma despite using a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, or those with more severe symptoms without treatment, should progress to step 3. This involves the addition of a LABA to regularly administered low-dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy and as-needed short-acting reliever therapy. The available evidence suggests that use of a LABA at this level provides symptom control superior to that from increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids.
An alternative method of delivering therapy at this or later stages of management is a combined inhaled corticosteroid/LABA for both preventer and reliever therapy. This relies on the use of a rapid- and long-acting beta -agonist (formoterol) in combination with a low-dose formulation of inhaled corticosteroid (usually budesonide, 200-400 µg twice daily) to be used as both controller and reliever therapy. This treatment has the advantage of convenience, as well as enabling the delivery of increased doses of inhaled corticosteroid for symptoms, thereby increasing anti-inflammatory controller treatment at the first sign of worsening symptoms. Evidence supports this approach for reducing asthma exacerbations. A potential concern with this approach is that patients may not take regular controller medication, and education therefore needs to emphasize the importance of using the budesonide/formoterol inhaler for both regular maintenance as well as reliever treatment.
At this treatment step, other options are the addition of a theophylline to low-dose inhaled corticosteroid medication or the addition of a leukotriene modifier, but both these treatment strategies appear to be less effective than the combination of a LABA with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid.
Step 4. Patients with more severe asthma and persistent symptoms despite step 3 treatment should be treated with escalating doses of inhaled corticosteroid and LABA therapy in addition to a SABA. Moderate to high doses of inhaled corticosteroid treatment are up to 1000 µg daily of HFA-beclometasone or equivalent in adults and up to 400 µg in children. At this level of treatment, additional controllers such as sustained-release theophylline or leukotriene modifiers can also be used.
Step 5. The highest level of treatment, step 5, involves the addition of oral corticosteroid treatment and/or anti-IgE therapy for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of high-dose controller inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs. Such unresponsive asthma symptoms should prompt a consideration of the diagnosis of asthma and the exclusion of other factors that may be worsening asthma. It is also appropriate to seek specialist referral at this stage. Oral corticosteroids should be used at the lowest dose and for the minimum time required to gain asthma symptom control. Immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus and azathioprine are occasionally used as oral corticosteroid-sparing agents.
Infants and young children. The symptom-driven stepwise approach to asthma care described above is similar in children. Generally, in very young children, low-dose inhaled corticosteroid treatments are preferred at step 2 of care. The dose ranges of inhaled corticosteroids should be considerably lower for children than for adults. Children over 7 years of age can usually use a puffer and spacer device, while those under 4 years of age are likely to require a face mask and spacer to deliver asthma treatments effectively. Between these ages the choice of device depends on the child and their experience with the medication.
Written treatment plan. All patients with asthma should have a written plan that describes their current step of asthma treatment and advises on treatment adjustments to accommodate worsening asthma (see Chapter 6). For many patients, such a plan will also involve instructions to take oral corticosteroids or seek medical advice for prescription of oral corticosteroid treatment.","<BULL> Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks. <BULL> Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy.

They can be used to reduce the amount of airway inflammation, thereby reducing the vagal tone of the airways. They also inhibit reflex bronchoconstriction provoked by inhaled irritants. They are less effective than inhaled beta -agonists and have a slower onset of action, taking 30-60 minutes to reach their maximum effect. They are particularly useful when administered as a nebulized aqueous aerosol (ASA; aspirin) and then gradually, over several weeks, IgE in the airways also falls, followed by downregulation of IgE receptors. Generally, an effect is observed after 4-6 months of treatment with attenuation of both early- and late-phase allergen-induced asthma (Table 4.2). They include anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids, sodium cromoglicate, nedocromil sodium and leukotriene modifiers, and long-acting bronchodilators such as long-acting beta -agonists (LABAs), omalizumab and sustained-release theophylline. They can also be used as a bronchodilator in combination with long-acting corticosteroids (LABAs, LTC, LTC, and LABAs). They can be used in combination with short-acting beta-agonists (LTC, LABAs, LABAs and LABAs) to reduce the risk of asthma exacerbations (Table 4.3). They can also use as bronchodilatory agents (LTC, lTC, LABas, LABAs).They can also be used with long-term asthma treatment (Table 4.4). Inhaled corticosteroid is the mainstay of effective asthma treatment, improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths.

9781908541680,ch_8,"Management: behavioral therapy
Behavioral therapy - the collective name for the various methods and strategies used to bring about changes in lifestyle - is universally credited as being one of the three main pillars of weight management, alongside dietary modification and increased physical activity (Chapters 5 and). Bringing about a change in behavior is an important part of clinical care; the ability to foster such change in patients is fundamental to the skill base of any health professional. Changing patients' habits and attitudes using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is key to long-term obesity management.
Classic behavioral interventions for managing obese patients may last months or years, but complex behavioral therapy concepts can be introduced during a normal consultation. In fact, many clinicians do so without realizing, by simply providing good advice in a logical ordered fashion. For example, if the first thing an individual does when arriving home from a stressful day is to eat two biscuits, basic dietary and nutritional advice is simple: stop eating biscuits. Behavioral therapy, on the other hand, suggests how to avoid eating the biscuits: the answer could be simple - don't buy any biscuits; or more complex - avoid the stressful situation that triggered the desire to eat biscuits, which may mean changing jobs, or walking home instead of taking a crowded bus. Other suggestions might include putting the biscuits where they are difficult to reach, or to have healthy snacks readily accessible instead. Alternatively, there may be other ways to unwind: such as having a bath or going for a run.
Behavioral therapy produces disappointing results when used alone, but has much more profound effects when used in combination with other modalities. In short-term studies, it has been shown to induce weight loss of 10% or more but this was not sustained in the long term. However, a long-term support program that combines behavioral therapy with regular physical activity and dietary advice can be highly successful in improving adherence to lifestyle changes and sustaining weight loss.
'Stage of change' theory
An individual's likelihood of accepting any lifestyle advice depends on their 'stage of change', which refers to their state of mind and reflects how motivated they are to undergo management for their condition. Before starting treatment it is important to determine which stage the individual is at and to act accordingly; success is unlikely if the wrong approach is made at the wrong time. The six stages are shown in Figure 7.1.
Elements of behavioral therapy
Goal setting: the agreement of realistic weight-loss targets, at a realistic rate of improvement
Self-monitoring: increasing self-awareness of eating patterns and physical activity behavior, which is an essential precursor for change
Stimulus control: avoiding situations that lead to harmful behavior, and promoting situations that influence healthy activity
Problem solving: how to avoid social and societal pressures that might result in straying from agreed goals and targets
Cognitive restructuring: identifying and modifying self-defeating thoughts and ideas.
Many of these techniques are summarized in Table 7.1.
Self-monitoring is a fundamental pillar of CBT; in its most basic form it constitutes a food and activity diary that records:
what is eaten
where the food is eaten, and in what circumstances
emotional feelings or triggers involved
levels of activity.
A food and activity diary should clarify eating patterns and behaviors, particularly events that trigger eating, with a view to changing those patterns once they have been identified, for instance by planning ahead. Once the pattern of eating has been established, the diary can be used as part of the treatment plan, by recording progress towards dietary goals. Long-term weight management has been shown to improve when food records are used.
Stimulus control. Different stimuli (cues) for eating, only one of which is feeling physically hungry, must first be identified then managed. For example, eating chocolate biscuits on arriving home from work is more likely to be because of stress than hunger; the stimulus control is therefore to remove the biscuit or the stress. External cues include:
time (exempli gratia eating because its lunchtime)
the presence of food (exempli gratia eating because food is available, or finishing a plateful because it is rude or wasteful not to [this can be a habit deeply ingrained from childhood])
social situations (exempli gratia eating cheese with port because everyone else is).
Stimulus control might involve avoiding external cues, for instance taking a different route home that avoids passing the temptation of a fast-food outlet. Controlling eating at the last stage of the chain (id est when one is already looking at the menu in the window) is incredibly difficult, whereas taking action earlier in the chain, when the meal is less tangible, is easier. Avoiding shopping whilst hungry is another example of stimulus control. Internal cues include stress or emotional eating (discussed below).
'Learned self-control' becomes important when the only route home passes the fast-food outlet, making external temptation unavoidable. Learned self-control occurs with prolonged repetition of the external stimulus, without giving in and eating. After enough journeys home without buying food, the conditioned response will be reduced.
Problem solving therapy (PST) can be used during a consultation to implement strategies for the management of obesity. PST facilitates the development of a set of skills that enhance a patient's self-efficacy, and high levels of self-efficacy correlate with successful outcomes in obesity management programs. Patients are supported to develop the ability to recognize potential solutions to their problems rather than solutions being suggested by the patient's healthcare practitioner. The process is outlined in Table 7.2; the skills developed are transferable to solving a range of problems.
'Stress management' is self-explanatory; comfort eating is widely recognized as a reason for overeating. However, evidence for hyperphagia in a stressful environment is conflicting, as for some individuals stress causes loss of appetite. Many people indulge in 'emotional eating': eating at times of stress, pressure or negative emotional state to provide comfort. This amounts to eating without relying on the usual stimulus of hunger to govern when food is required. Such behavior may reflect childhood patterns, even breast-feeding, when eating and comfort were closely associated. Others admit to 'bingeing' on energy-dense foods when commonsense tells them to stop but they feel powerless to resist.
These phenomena may arise from common pathways in the brain that relate to satiety and mood; the underlying stress or depression must be confronted for weight loss to be successful.
Eating disorders
Binge eating disorder (BED) is specifically recognized in its own right in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the broadly accepted manual for mental illness classification, published by the American Psychiatric Association. Patients with BED display the features of bulimia nervosa but without the purging, abnormal exercise regimens or other compensatory behavior to induce weight loss (see also Fast Facts: Eating Disorders). The condition was largely ignored when it was first recognized in 1959 but has recently gained greater prominence.
Diagnostic criteria are loss of control of eating plus three of:
eating much more rapidly than normal
eating until uncomfortably full
eating large amounts when not physically hungry
eating alone because of embarrassment of volume of consumption
feeling disgusted, depressed or very guilty afterward.
Its features include recurrent episodes of eating objectively large amounts of food within a discrete period of time, a subjective sense of lack of control during each eating episode, binge eating at least 2 days a week on average for 6 months and no regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, id est purging, fasting or excessive exercise. It is estimated that 2.5% of adult women and 1.1% of men have BED, most, but not all, of whom are obese. The prevalence among patients attending obesity clinics is 20-30%, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the condition without delay.
Treatment involves conventional weight management combined with CBT. Strict dietary regimens are likely to aggravate the condition and should be avoided. Depression and personality disorders have been linked with BED but it is unclear whether the abnormal eating pattern predates the emotional disorder or vice versa.
Night eating syndrome (NES) was recognized as an abnormal eating pattern in the 1950s by Albert Stunkard, as was its association with psychological and emotional factors. Individuals with NES tend to be moody, tense, anxious, nervous and depressed; NES is thought to be associated with abnormal reactions to stress and changes in the circadian rhythm, with a disruption of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis. Criteria are shown in Table 7.3.
The prevalence of NES in the general population is 1-2%, rising to 10% of obese patients and as many as a quarter of grossly obese people. It is associated with obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome, but has no association with nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder, which is more of a sleep disorder than an eating disorder characterized by eating during sleep (rather like sleep walking). Patients with NES lack hunger before their episodes of night eating, display 'automaticity' of the behavior during waking intervals and varying levels of consciousness during eating.
Treatment is predominantly behavioral rather than dietary, initially by persuading patients to have an early substantial breakfast and to regain a normal eating pattern. The circadian rhythm should be reinforced by the appropriate amount of exercise during the day, with normal regular mealtimes and daily routines.","<BULL> Behavioral therapy, alongside diet and lifestyle advice, is one of the three key components of obesity management. <BULL> A person's degree of motivation and expectations should be assessed. <BULL> Techniques include goal setting, self-monitoring and stimulus control. <BULL> Binge eating disorder and night eating syndrome are specific eating disorders and should be treated accordingly.","Management: behavioral therapy, cognitive restructuring, and eating.

9781910797457,chp8,"Management of castrate-resistant prostate cancer
In most cases, advanced prostate cancers treated with any form of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) eventually begin to progress, a phenomenon known as 'castrate resistance'. An increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after initially successful androgen deprivation almost inevitably indicates impending clinical progression. Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has been characterized as disease that has progressed despite the persistence of castrate levels of androgens (< 1.73 nmol/L or 50 ng/dL), but remains hormone sensitive and is amenable to further hormonal manipulation. This state probably arises from either clonal selection of androgen-independent cell lines (Figure 8.1) or increased ligand-independent activation of androgen receptors.
Men with CRPC are a heterogeneous group, ranging from men with increasing PSA only and no demonstrable metastases to those who have many bone and/or visceral metastases (Figure 8.2), pain and poor functional status. Survival can range from only a few months to 4 years or more. Historically, therapy had little effect beyond modest palliation. More recently, however, several new treatment options have become available that not only improve quality of life and reduce pain but also increase survival (Figure 8.3). Some of the trials with important results for the treatment of CRPC are summarized in Table 8.1.
Further hormonal manipulation
Antiandrogens. When the serum PSA level rises after a period of ADT alone, an initial step may be to add an antiandrogen to the treatment. This may transiently reduce PSA, but the PSA will usually start to rise again relatively soon. Withdrawal of the antiandrogen at this time produces a favorable PSA response in approximately 40% of men for 4-6 months. This phenomenon has been ascribed to a mutation affecting androgen receptors in malignant tissue which means that the antiandrogen acts as an agonist (stimulatory) rather than an antagonist (blocker), so when the antiandrogen is withdrawn the stimulation is reduced; a similar phenomenon occurs in breast cancer treated with antiestrogens. As long as the patient is asymptomatic, the addition and withdrawal of different antiandrogens can be continued for 2-3 cycles, as previous antiandrogen administration does not appear to diminish the response to different antiandrogens.
Adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitors. Antiandrogen withdrawal followed by inhibitors of adrenal androgen synthesis, such as aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole, has been shown to result in good reductions in PSA levels. However, adrenal androgen synthesis inhibitors are very toxic and not well tolerated, so this is not a usual treatment option.
Estrogen treatment may benefit some men with CRPC. It appears to have two effects:
inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion
direct cytotoxic effect on the tumor.
The synthetic estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES) has been used in prostate cancer but its use in first-line therapy is limited by side effects such as gynecomastia, deep-vein thrombosis and other cardiovascular complications. A combination of DES with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin) or warfarin may reduce the thrombotic and cardiovascular toxicity, which can be particularly hazardous in men of this age, but patients should be alerted to the risks.
Non-metastatic (M0) castrate-resistant prostate cancer
Men who start ADT before any metastases are found, such as for a rising PSA after radiotherapy, may become castrate resistant without any evidence of distant metastases (M0 CRPC). These men can present a difficult management dilemma, because the rising PSA can cause significant psychological distress, even though they are asymptomatic.
Traditionally, treatment has been either further hormonal manipulation, as described above, or treatment within a clinical trial. Once these fail, however, an observational approach is taken until the patient develops demonstrable metastases (M1 CRPC) for which further treatments are available (see below).
Although a number of therapies, such as the endothelin antagonists atrasentan and zibotentan, have been trialed, none has been effective in delaying the progression of M0 CRPC to M1 CRPC. A plethora of new drugs are being evaluated and, with time, it is possible that one or more may be effective for this disease stage.
Metastatic (M1) castrate-resistant prostate cancer
Abiraterone is approved as first-line treatment for metastatic CRPC. It is a specific inhibitor of cytochrome P450 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17), a key enzyme in androgen synthesis (Figure 8.4). Abiraterone is effective in CRPC because, despite castrate levels of circulating androgens from luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist/antagonist therapy, CRPC cells synthesize their own androgens from cholesterol, which then perpetuate androgen receptor signaling.
In a randomized trial involving 1088 men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC who had not received previous chemotherapy, abiraterone plus prednisone improved radiographic progression-free survival and OS compared with prednisone alone; it also delayed PSA progression and increased the times to opiate use and initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy (see Table 8.1). The incidence of grade 3/4 mineralocorticoid-related adverse events and liver-function abnormalities was higher in the group receiving abiraterone, but no unique toxic events occurred.
Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor, approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC either prior to chemotherapy or after previous docetaxel treatment. It inhibits nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor, DNA binding and coactivator recruitment (Figure 8.5), and has a greater affinity for the receptor than non-steroidal antiandrogens; it does not have any agonist activity (see Table 8.1).
In the PREVAIL trial in men with metastatic CRPC who had not had prior chemotherapy, oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, was associated with a 29% improvement in survival compared with placebo. Enzalutamide was associated with fatigue, diarrhea and hot flashes.
Docetaxel, a member of the taxoid family, induces apoptosis through microtubule stabilization; it has been established as first-line therapy for M1 CRPC for many years. A randomized trial (TAX-327) in men with CRPC found that a 3-week schedule of docetaxel was superior to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in terms of disease progression and OS (see Table 8.1). The incidence of neutropenia, skin reactions and gastrointestinal problems was higher with docetaxel than with mitoxantrone plus prednisone. These are the most common side effects with docetaxel but in general the chemotherapeutic agent is well tolerated.
Radium-223 delivers targeted alpha therapy to bones. It is approved for the treatment of CRPC in men with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. As alpha particles have limited penetration, radium-223 delivers highly localized therapy, killing tumor cells but with minimal damage to surrounding tissue. The phase III ALSYMPCA study compared radium-223 with best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo with BSC in men with CRPC and bone metastases who had failed on or were unsuitable for docetaxel treatment. OS was improved with radium-223 (see Table 8.1); side effects included increased low-grade nausea, diarrhea and occasional neutropenia.
Second-line therapy. Treatment options when prostate cancer progresses after docetaxel chemotherapy include further chemotherapy, one of the new hormonal modulation agents or targeted alpha therapy.
Cabazitaxel. This taxane chemotherapy was developed to overcome the resistance that can develop as a result of docetaxel treatment. In the TROPIC study, men with CRPC that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomized to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone. Those who received cabazitaxel demonstrated a 30% improvement in survival compared with those receiving mitoxantrone (15.1 versus 12.7 months; Figure 8.6 and see Table 8.1). Side effects were similar to those seen with docetaxel.
Mitoxantrone and prednisone was the first chemotherapy combination to be tested in a randomized trial in advanced prostate cancer. The combination was very well tolerated and more than doubled the time of palliation response compared with prednisone alone. It also improved the quality of life of men with CRPC. It has now been replaced by docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy and by cabazitaxel as second-line chemotherapy, which have better efficacy; however, the combination still has a place in second-line therapy when resistance to docetaxel has developed and cabazitaxel is not an option.
Abiraterone. In a study in men with metastatic CRPC for whom docetaxel chemotherapy had failed, abiraterone plus prednisone resulted in a 35% improvement in survival compared with prednisone alone (see Table 8.1). Mineralocorticoid-related adverse events, including fluid retention, hypertension and hypokalemia, were more frequent in the abiraterone group, highlighting the continuing dependency of CRPC on androgen-receptor signaling even after it has become castrate resistant (see Table 8.1).
Enzalutamide. In the AFFIRM trial, oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, improved survival in men with metastatic CRPC after failure of docetaxel chemotherapy (see Table 8.1). However, rates of fatigue, diarrhea and hot flashes were higher in the enzalutamide group. Enzalutamide is often used after failure of docetaxel chemotherapy, if not used prior to it.
Radium-223 delivers targeted alpha therapy to bones, delaying symptomatic skeletal and skeletal-related events. It has also been shown to improve OS (see page 109).
Therapies that modulate the immune system are showing considerable promise in trials of CRPC. These therapies take time to mediate an effect and are therefore best used in men with minimal or no symptoms.
Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy. In a phase III trial of men with CRPC not previously treated with docetaxel, treatment with sipuleucel-T resulted in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death compared with placebo, with minimal side effects (see Table 8.1). This is the first immunotherapy to demonstrate a survival advantage in prostate cancer; however, treatment is complicated and requires a specialized laboratory, which makes it extremely expensive to administer.
Ipilimumab. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), which is a negative regulator of T-cell activation, has emerged as a target for cancer immunotherapy. Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks the binding of CTLA-4 to its ligands, thereby augmenting T-cell activation and proliferation and resulting in tumor regression. Significant tumor responses with ipilimumab were seen in a phase II trial in men with metastatic CRPC. This immunotherapy is currently in phase III trials.
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-1 (programmed cell death protein-1) or PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1), such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, can reinforce anti-tumor immune response by stimulating the activity of effector T cells against cancer cells and the tumor micro-environment. Various PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are currently in phase II trials.
It is likely that a single immune therapy may not have sufficient activity against CRPC, and that combinations of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade will be required.
PROSTVAC-VF is a prostate cancer vaccine regimen, consisting of a recombinant vaccinia vector as a primary vaccination, followed by multiple booster vaccinations, employing a recombinant fowlpox vector. These vaccines stimulate an antigen-presenting cell-mediated immune response to PSA-expressing tumor cells. In a small randomized study of men with metastatic CRPC, those treated with PROSTVAC-VF had better OS than the placebo group (25.1 versus 16.6 months). These results are promising but need confirmation in larger randomized trials.
Management of bone metastases
Bone pain is one of the most intractable problems associated with CRPC, and conventional analgesics do not always provide relief.
Palliative radiotherapy. Hormone-naïve disease is initially managed with ADT. However, some men do not get full resolution of pain, or may have painful bone metastases in the setting of CRPC.
Focal external-beam radiotherapy is a well-established treatment, providing rapid improvement in pain in up to 80% of men. Treatment can be given as either a single fraction or as multiple fractions over 2-3 weeks. This type of irradiation is associated with very few side effects.
Wide-field radiation may also be useful in patients with intractable diffuse pain. It can delay the progression of existing disease as well as slow the occurrence of new disease, but is associated with side effects such as pneumonitis, cataracts, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in approximately 35% of patients, and severe, sometimes irreversible, hematological effects in 9%.
Systemic radionuclide therapy is a means of targeting multiple painful bone metastases by intravenous administration of a radionuclide (such as samarium-153) complexed to bone-avid molecules such as ethylenediamine tetra (methylene phosphonic acid) (EDTMP), or radionuclides that have a natural affinity for metabolically active bone, such as strontium-89. After administration of samarium-153, 65-80% of patients report relief from pain and symptoms within 1 week. The average duration of response is 2-3 months. The major toxicity is myelosuppression, which can last a number of months; white blood cell count and platelet levels should therefore be monitored before and after therapy.
CyberKnife-targeted radiotherapy is becoming increasingly popular for the targeted treatment of metastases that are solitary or low in numbers (id est oligometastases; see page 70).
Bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption and demineralization, providing symptomatic benefit in some patients. A study involving over 600 men with CRPC demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of patients with bone-related events among those receiving zoledronic acid (zoledronate), given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks, compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid also significantly delayed the onset of first skeletal-related event (see Table 8.1); however, the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one death is 10.
Side effects with bisphosphonates include renal deterioration and, rarely, osteonecrosis of the jaw.
Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand); it inhibits osteoclast function and bone turnover. A randomized trial involving 1904 men with CRPC supported denosumab as the optimal medication to reduce bone-related events in men with CRPC (see Table 8.1).
Palliative care
Despite improving therapies, most patients with CRPC eventually die as a result of the cancer, often within 12-24 months. Treatment with high-dose steroids can sometimes provide useful palliation. The palliative care of these patients requires a supportive and caring team approach involving the family physician, the urologist, an experienced palliative care team and, of course, the patient's close relatives and friends.
Treatment algorithm
A suggested algorithm for the treatment of CRPC is presented in Figure 8.7.","<BULL> After an initial response to androgen ablation, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value starts to rise as a result of androgen-insensitive cell clones. <BULL> As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen. <BULL> The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy.

It has been shown to reduce the risk of death in men with metastatic prostate cancer (Figure 8.3). It has been shown that it can reduce the risk of metastatic prostate cancer by up to 50% compared with placebo. It has also been shown to decrease the risk of death compared with placebo (Figure 8.4).Denosumab is an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor, approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC either prior to chemotherapy or after previous docetaxel treatment.

9781910797815,chp7,"New treatments for myeloproliferative neoplasms
Several treatments for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are currently in clinical development, including new Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and agents acting on different therapeutic targets (Table 7.1); combination regimens are also being explored.
JAK inhibitors
Several JAK inhibitors have been evaluated in clinical trials in patients with myelofibrosis.
Pacritinib is an inhibitor of both JAK2 and FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), an enzyme that is important in the development of the hematopoietic and immune systems. The efficacy of this agent in patients with myelofibrosis has been evaluated in two randomized Phase III trials: PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2. PERSIST-1 excluded patients who had previously received JAK2 inhibitors whereas such patients were eligible to enter PERSIST-2. In PERSIST-1, the primary endpoint was at least 35% reduction in spleen volume, and a secondary endpoint was at least 50% reduction in total symptom scores; these were co-primary endpoints in PERSIST-2. Both trials showed pacritinib to be superior to best available therapy in terms of spleen and symptom responses. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia).
Momelotinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor. In the SIMPLIFY-1 trial in JAK2 inhibitor-naive patients with myelofibrosis, momelotinib produced comparable spleen responses to ruxolitinib but less control of symptoms. In the SIMPLIFY-2 study, momelotinib was not superior to best available therapy in terms of spleen response rates but anemia endpoints were met.
Fedratinib is a JAK2 inhibitor that provided significant improvements in symptom scores and spleen volume in trials involving patients with myelofibrosis., Clinical development was temporarily halted because of concerns about Wernicke's encephalopathy (eight cases among 877 patients across 18 studies). However, this could be attributed to thiamine depletion linked to the high metabolic rate of cancer patients and malnourishment, and is readily managed. Fedratinib is likely to be useful in both first line (with benefits demonstrated in patients with platelet counts as low as 50 x 10 /L) and second line. In the JAKARTA2 study involving with patients with myelofibrosis following failure of ruxolitinib, 46 of 83 assessable patients showed a spleen response.
Ropeginterferon alfa-2b is a recombinant form of interferon (IFN)-alpha-2b that has a longer elimination half-life than other pegylated IFN preparations, and a favorable safety profile. The efficacy and safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b has been investigated in the randomized PROUD-PV study, which involved 254 patients with PV, and the follow-up CONTI-PV study. At 2 years, a complete hematologic response (European LeukemiaNet criteria) was achieved in 71% of patients receiving ropeginterferon alfa-2b compared with 49% of patients receiving hydroxyurea (p = 0.010); the proportion of patients with both complete hematologic response and symptomatic improvement was also numerically higher with ropeginterferon alfa-2b (50%, versus 37% with hydroxyurea; not significant). Partial molecular response (reduction in mutant JAK2 allele burden) was achieved in 70% of patients receiving ropeginterferon alfa-2b, compared with 29% of those receiving hydroxyurea (p = 0.005). Furthermore, in contrast to the hydroxyurea group, the response rates continued to improve over the 2-year treatment period in patients receiving ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b was associated with lower rates of anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia than hydroxyurea, and there were no treatment- or disease-related secondary malignancies.
Other therapeutic targets
Many therapies targeting diverse molecular targets are currently being investigated in myelofibrosis (Table 7.1).
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The JAK2/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is an indirect activator of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B)/mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway, inhibitors of which have been shown to dose-dependently inhibit the proliferation of cell lines with JAK2 V617F mutations, and to reduce clonogenic activity in hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with MPNs. Everolimus, which inhibits the mTOR kinase TORC1, has been shown to inhibit proliferation in JAK2 V617F-mutated cell lines when administered alone or in combination with JAK2 inhibitors, and produced a response rate of 23% in a Phase I/II study in patients with myelofibrosis. The PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) was not effective in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Several HDAC inhibitors have been evaluated in patients with MPNs.
Vorinostat has been shown to reduce spleen size, pruritis and thrombocytosis or leukocytosis in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or PV but was associated with significant adverse events that resulted in a high discontinuation rate.
Panobinostat showed good efficacy and tolerability in a Phase I study in patients with myelofibrosis, and is currently being evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in Phase I/II trials. Although there is some evidence of better efficacy with this combination in terms of reduction in spleen volume, and some reversal of marrow fibrosis, patients experienced significant fatigue, anemia and gastrointestinal toxicity.
Givinostat. Clinical activity has been reported in a Phase IIa study in patients with ET or PV, and a study in patients with PV refractory to, or intolerance of, hydroxyurea. In a Phase II study involving 22 patients with myelofibrosis, 36% showed some clinical benefit and 27% had a reduction in splenomegaly. A large study of givinostat in patients with newly diagnosed PV is planned.
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as decitabine and azacitidine may be effective in patients with MPN with signs of leukemic transformation (see Chapter 9). - These agents have also been evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in the treatment of myelofibrosis but to date there is no clear evidence that combination therapy improves efficacy.
Hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Hedgehog is a signaling pathway required for cell differentiation. Abnormalities in hedgehog pathway signaling have been described in animal models of myelofibrosis but most trials with inhibitors of this pathway in patients with MPN have not shown any benefit. However, some efficacy was seen with glasdegib in a recent Phase Ib/II trial involving 21 patients with myelofibrosis previously treated with JAK inhibitors: five patients had reductions in spleen volume and one showed improvement in anemia and became transfusion-independent.
Glasdegib was associated with significant toxicity, including dysguesia (62% of patients), muscle spasms (57%), alopecia (38%), decreased appetite and fatigue (both 33%). Other studies have suggested that treatment with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor may enhance the efficacy of hypomethylating agents in patients with myelofibrosis or MPN blast phase.
Telomerase inhibitors. Telomerase controls the addition of telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes and is therefore essential for chromosome stability. Expression of telomerase is increased in MPNs,, suggesting that this enzyme may represent a potential therapeutic target. In a study with the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat, involving 33 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, complete or partial responses were achieved in 21%. All four patients who had complete responses also showed reductions in bone marrow fibrosis. The most common adverse events were myelotoxicity and transient reductions in liver enzymes. However, a Phase II study in patients with relapsed or refractory myelofibrosis following treatment with ruxolitinib has been suspended.
Inhibitors of bone marrow fibrosis. Bone marrow fibrosis in patients with MPNs is believed to be due to cytokine release from clonal cells, which creates an environment that favors maintenance or expansion of the malignant clone. Inhibition of bone marrow fibrosis might therefore represent a therapeutic strategy. In animal models, fibrosis can be reduced by pentraxin-2 (PTX-2), an endogenous regulator of tissue repair, concentrations of which are reduced in patients with myelofibrosis. Reductions in fibrosis, hemoglobin levels and transfusion requirements have been reported in a Phase II study in patients with myelofibrosis who received recombinant human pentraxin-2 (PRM-151) in combination with ruxolitinib. A study of PRM-151 in patients refractory to, intolerant of or ineligible for ruxolitinib is in progress.
Other fibrosis inhibitors that have been evaluated in Phase I/II trials include fresolimumab - a monoclonal antibody against transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta - and simtuzumab, a humanized antibody against LOXL2 (lysyl oxidase-like), an enzyme that plays a role in crosslinking and stabilizing collagen and elastin fibers.
Erythropoiesis inhibitor blockers
Luspatercept (ACE-536) and sotatercept (ACE-011) are novel fusion proteins that block the effects of cytokines such as the TGF-beta superfamily in inhibiting the terminal stages of erythropoiesis.
In a Phase II dose-finding study of luspatercept in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (the PACE-MDS study), hematologic improvement was achieved in 32 of 51 patients (62.7%) at doses of 0.75-1.75 mg/kg, and treatment was generally well tolerated. The safety and efficacy of luspatercept in patients with myelofibrosis and anemia are currently being investigated in a Phase II open-label study.
Sotatercept has shown promising efficacy and tolerability in a Phase II dose-ranging study in patients with MDS, and it is currently being investigated in a Phase II open-label study in patients with MPN-related myelofibrosis and anemia.
MDM2 inhibitors. The MDM2 oncogene induces binding of p53 to ubiquitin, thereby shortening the plasma half-life of p53 and reducing p53-induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Inhibition of MDM2 may therefore restore the pro-apoptotic activity of p53. The MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin is currently being evaluated in a number of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, and in patients with ET or PV.
Arginase inhibitors. Arginase has an important role in the immunosuppressant processes that allow tumor cells to evade destruction by the immune system. The arginase inhibitor S-(2-boronoethyl)-l-cysteine (BEC) has been shown to reduce fibrosis and thrombosis-related endothelial dysfunction in animal models,, suggesting that this approach may be useful in patients with MPN. The arginase inhibitors are attracting increasing attention in the management of a number of cancer types.
Bcl-2 antagonists. B cell leukemia-2 (Bcl)-2 proteins have anti-apoptotic effects, and the JAK V617F mutation has been associated with dysregulation of these proteins in patients with ET or primary myelofibrosis. The Bcl-2 antagonist obatoclax mesylate showed limited efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies or myelofibrosis., Another Bcl-2 inhibitor, navitoclax, is currently being evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in an open-label study in patients with myelofibrosis.
BET inhibitors. Bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitors bind to the bromodomain of the BET proteins, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, blocking their interaction with acetylated histones and transcription factors. These proteins are examples of 'epigenetic readers' and have been implicated in various hematologic malignancies, prompting trials of BET inhibitors. Early studies also suggest that use of a BET inhibitor in combination with a targeted therapy may prevent resistance. However, the BET proteins have distinct transcriptional pathways, and selectivity may be a challenge in clinical development.
Combination therapy
Several treatments are currently being evaluated for use in combination with ruxolitinib, in order to enable an adequate dose of ruxolitinib (exempli gratia by increasing the platelet count) or to improve the response; some of the combinations are listed in Table 7.2. However, this approach raises a number of questions regarding the most appropriate clinical trial design, particularly in terms of patient selection and clinical endpoints.","<BULL> A variety of new therapies directed against diverse molecular targets are currently being evaluated. <BULL> The Janus kinase 2 inhibitor pacritinib was superior to best available therapy in patients with myelofibrosis in terms of spleen and symptom responses. <BULL> Other potential therapeutic targets include signaling pathways, histone deacetylase, telomerase, DNA methyltransferase and blockade of erythropoietin inhibitors. <BULL> The use of ruxolitinib in combination with new therapies may offer a further potential approach to treatment.","dependently inhibit the proliferation of cell lines with JAK2 V617F mutations, and to reduce clonogenic activity in hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with MPNs. Everolimus, which inhibits the mTOR kinase TORC1, has been shown to inhibit proliferation in JAK2 v617F-mutated cell lines when administered alone or in combination with JAK2 inhibitors, and produced a response rate of 23% in a Phase I/II study in patients with myelofibrosis. The PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) was not effective in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with MPNs, but was effective in a Phase II study in patients with MPN, and in a Phase I study in patients with PERSIST-PV (PERSIST-1) and PERSIST-2 (PERSIST 2) in patients with PMN. PERSIST-1 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of the TGF-beta superfamily in inhibiting the terminal stages of erythropoiesis.PERSIST-2 is an inhibitor of TGF-beta. In a Phase II dose-finding study of luspatercept in patients with Ielodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (the PACE-MDS study), hematologic improvement was achieved in 32 of 51 patients (62.7%) at doses of 0.75-1.75 mg/kg, and treatment was generally well tolerated. The safety and efficacy of luspaterceptor in patients with myELofibrosis and anemia are currently being investigated in a Phase II open-label study.PERSIST 2 is an inhibitor of tGF-beta.

9783318066685,ch4,"4 Gene therapies with proven clinical efficacy
Several gene therapy drugs are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to be marketed as medicines (Table 4.1). Others have shown strong efficacy in early clinical studies and are therefore being evaluated in Phase III trials. Examples of gene therapies with track records of clinical efficacy are described in the following sections and summarized in Table 4.2.
Hereditary blindness
Prior to gene therapy, no treatment was available for certain forms of hereditary blindness. However, the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to transduce retinal cells on subretinal administration has enabled the development of therapies for such diseases. This effort ultimately led to the first gene therapy drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of a genetic disease in late 2017.
Leber congenital amaurosis.
In Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2), mutations in the RPE65 gene prevent the expression of retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (RPE65), thereby impairing the process of visual photo-transduction and severely limiting vision. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Affected infants typically already have decreased visual responsiveness at birth.
Initially, three independent clinical studies demonstrated that a single subretinal injection of AAV2 vector expressing the therapeutic RPE65 gene improved vision in treated regions of the retina. This improvement was stable for at least 3 years. One protocol was successfully expanded to pediatric patients. Importantly, early intervention substantially improved the potential for restoring vision. Patients showed an increase in pupillary light responses of 2 log units or more, with one child gaining light sensitivity near to that of age-matched normal-sighted individuals.
As a safety precaution, patients participating in these early studies had received gene transfer to only one eye. Likely facilitated by the immune-privileged nature of the eye, subsequent vector administration to the contralateral eye was successful, with study participants demonstrating gradually improved sensitivity to dim light, activation of the visual cortex and improved navigational skills. Equally important, there were no adverse effects to their previously treated eye. As perhaps expected, functional gains from gene transfer to the second eye were more pronounced in younger patients. Children receiving the gene therapy experienced vast improvements in their quality of life, such as being able to attend school or participate in sports.
Success with LCA2 gene therapy has generated interest in developing gene therapy for other retinal diseases. For instance, successful outcomes of a gene therapy trial for choroideremia have been reported. In these patients, mutations in the X-linked CHM gene (which encodes Rab escort protein 1 [REP-1]) cause slow and progressive degeneration of photoreceptors, choroid and retinal pigmented epithelium, typically leading to complete blindness by middle age. REP-1 has important functions related to intracellular protein trafficking. Thus, absence of functional REP-1 may lead to early cell death. Importantly, subretinal gene transfer with an AAV2 vector carrying the CHM gene substantially improved vision in two patients and increased retinal sensitivity in four more patients.
Neuromuscular disorder: spinal muscular atrophy
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes death in infants. Loss of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle wasting, initially affecting arm, leg and respiratory muscles. The disease is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which is autosomal recessive and encodes survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (SMN1), a protein necessary for motor neuron survival. The SMN1 protein is important for the biogenesis and assembly of small nuclear ribonucleic particles (snRNPs), which are critical in messenger (m)RNA splicing (spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing). While SMN1 is ubiquitously expressed, its loss is particularly detrimental to motor neurons. Without functional motor neurons, the central nervous system (CNS) is unable to send signals to skeletal muscles, and babies born with this defect gradually become paralyzed.
To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1. This vector is capable of transducing motor neurons and effectively transduces the spinal cord after systemic administration. Moreover, it is also able to cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce cells in the brains of rhesus macaques, even in animals up to 3 years old. Nonetheless, it is thought that the most effective reversal of disease can be achieved early in life. Remarkably, all 15 babies treated by this gene therapy in the initial clinical trial are alive at age 20 months or older (these patients were expected to die within the first 2 years of life). Most can sit up, and some are even able to walk. The FDA has approved the systemic AAV gene therapy for SMN1-deficient children up to the age of 2 years.
Lysosomal storage disorder: metachromatic leukodystrophy
Myelin-producing cells in infants born with deficiency in arylsulfatase A (ARSA) accumulate sulfatide (sulfated glycolipids), which leads to demyelination of the nervous system and thus severe motor and cognitive damage. The first signs of the disease (late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy [MLD]) appear in the second year of life; life expectancy is less than a decade. It was hoped that restoration of enzymatic activity in macrophages or microglia could halt the disease, and that this could potentially be achieved with a bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant. However, these treatments are only marginally effective in halting disease progression, especially with regard to motor neuron function. Overexpression of ARSA using gene-modified HSCs may overcome these limitations by delivering a level of ARSA to microglia that would correct neighboring cells and thus halt demyelination.
To test this hypothesis in the clinic, three pre-symptomatic individuals received mild bone marrow conditioning followed by transplant of lentivirally transduced autologous CD34+ HSCs. Engraftment of gene-corrected cells was successful in bone marrow and peripheral blood. At 2 years after gene transfer, these children continued to produce therapeutic levels of functional ARSA enzyme and showed normal motor and cognitive development without evidence of disease manifestation. Follow-up studies in a total of nine treated patients showed that the protocol indeed needs to be administered early during disease onset to obtain optimal results for motor and cognitive functions and prevention of CNS demyelination. Stable reconstitution of ARSA activity in the cerebrospinal fluid can be achieved within 6 months after gene therapy. How to reduce this lag in enzyme delivery to the CNS is still an open question to be addressed.
Primary immune deficiencies: severe combined immune deficiencies
Children born with primary immune deficiency suffer from recurrent infections, which may become lethal. Life expectancy is typically just a few years unless an HLA-matched bone marrow transplant is performed. However, compatible donors are typically found for fewer than 20% of patients. Hence, gene therapies have been developed to correct autologous HSCs in children born with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1), adenosine deaminase deficiency-severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. These therapies circumvent the need for HLA-matched donors and also avoid immune suppression and complications arising from graft versus host disease.
SCID-X1 accounts for 40% of cases of severe combined immune deficiency and is caused by a lack of the gamma chain (gammac) that is shared by multiple cytokine receptors. Therefore, T cells are absent, B-cell function is impaired and natural killer (NK) cells fail to develop. Retrovirally transduced HSCs effectively restore immune function. Because of the strong selective advantage of gene-corrected cells, there is no need for bone marrow conditioning. However, development of leukemia in six of the 20 patients studied emerged as a major setback in these trials. This prompted the development of self-inactivating (SIN) viral vectors, which are devoid of long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter/enhancer function, and of lentiviral vectors to replace first-generation murine gammaretroviral vectors. In SIN vectors, a deletion is introduced into one of the LTR sequences. One round of transcription and reverse transcription 'copies' the deletion onto the second LTR, a process termed 'self-inactivation'.
ADA-SCID represents another fatal primary immunodeficiency with impaired T, B and NK cell development. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme required for the clearance of toxic purine metabolites from the body. Patients also experience various non-immune complications in the pulmonary, hematologic, gastrointestinal, neurological and skeletal systems. Partial correction can be achieved by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Interestingly, ADA-SCID was the target for the very first gene therapy trial in 1990. However, at that time gene transfer to stem cells was highly inefficient. In subsequent trials, patients received non-myeloablative conditioning (using low-dose busulfan), and ERT was discontinued before transplantation with gammaretrovirally transduced autologous HSCs expressing the ADA transgene (Figure 4.1). Remarkably, gene therapy essentially resulted in a cure, with gene correction in multiple cell lineages, ADA expression at normal levels and restoration of immune competence. A large number of patients with ADA-SCID have now been treated without developing leukemia or other noticeable genotoxicity. Hence, the gene therapy product for ADA-SCID obtained marketing approval from the EMA.
Nonetheless, SIN retroviral or lentiviral vectors may be the basis for future gene therapy drugs for ADA-SCID, adding another layer of safety. Here, transgene expression is controlled by an internal promoter instead of a functional LTR.
Additional insights emerged from the cumulative experience with gene therapy for ADA-SCID. ERT does not appear to reduce the selective advantage of gene-corrected cells and may have synergistic effects with gene transfer. For instance, ERT may partially correct the hypocellularity in the bone marrow, increase HSC mobilization in the blood, shorten the time period of lymphopenia until gene-corrected lymphocytes appear and prevent systemic organ toxicity. Despite all these advances in treatment, some neurological, auditory and behavioral problems may still be seen in patients. It is possible that, compared with the blood and other organs, ADA delivery to the brain is limited following gene therapy, or that some irreversible damage to the CNS has already occurred prior to gene therapy.
Hematologic disorder: hemophilia
To stop bleeding on injury of a blood vessel, a series of enzymatic reactions needs to occur in the blood (the coagulation cascade) to form a clot that seals the vessel. One of these reactions is catalyzed by serine protease factor IX (FIX), working in concert with its co-factor, factor VIII (FVIII). Mutations in either of the X-linked genes encoding FVIII or FIX cause hemophilia, which occurs in 1 in 5000 male births worldwide. Disease severity correlates with residual coagulation activity. In individuals with severe disease (< 1% clotting activity), the resulting failure of the blood to clot causes spontaneous bleeds into joints and soft tissues; certain types of bleeds can be life-threatening. The current treatment of hemophilia is mostly based on intravenous infusion of recombinant or plasma-derived FVIII or FIX proteins, which is done in prophylactic treatment protocols three times per week to prevent bleeds. Recombinant factors with prolonged half-lives have been developed to reduce the frequency of injections.
The treatment of hemophilia is undergoing more revolutionary changes with the development of alternative molecular approaches. A major complication in factor-replacement therapy is the development of neutralizing antibodies ('inhibitors') against the therapeutic protein. This occurs in 20-30% of treated patients with hemophilia A (FVIII deficiency, the more common form of the disease - FIX deficiency is called hemophilia B). A bispecific antibody has been developed that mimics FVIII function and is effective in providing hemostasis even in the presence of an inhibitor. The antibody is given subcutaneously every 1-4 weeks, with minor differences in bleeding rates between regimens.
Nonetheless, lifelong treatment of hemophilia is burdensome and expensive and typically not available in developing countries. In contrast, gene therapy has the potential to be curative, lasting for many years after a single round of gene transfer (> 10 years in canine models).
Both FVIII and FIX are normally made in the liver (FVIII in liver endothelial cells and FIX in hepatocytes). However, diverse cell types are capable of producing functional coagulation factors, and tight regulation of gene expression is not required as the therapeutic range is wide. For example, raising coagulation activity to above 5% changes the disease phenotype to mild, typically requiring few additional factor infusions.
A large number of approaches, utilizing different gene transfer vectors and cell types for transgene expression, were initially explored during the 1990s. Since then, in vivo gene transfer to hepatocytes using AAV vectors has emerged as the leading method, and this is being evaluated in three Phase III trials and multiple more Phase I/II trials (Table 4.3, Figure 4.2). Various viral capsids have been adapted that allow for the transduction of hepatocytes after injection into a peripheral vein, and tissue-specific promoters are employed to restrict transgene expression to hepatocytes.
The complementary (c)DNA encoding wild-type FVIII is too large to fit into an AAV vector. A B-domain-deleted version of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) is fully functional but still poses challenges for vector engineering, given its size of around 4.5 kb. Nonetheless, development of small yet potent hepatocyte-specific promoters and codon optimization (to avoid translational codons that are only rarely used in mammalian cells and therefore limit protein expression, among other changes in the coding sequence) led to greatly improved expression cassettes for BDD-FVIII.
Given the smaller size of the coding sequence for FIX (1.4 kb), it could even be incorporated into 'self-complementary' AAV vectors. These have a genome half the size of a conventional single-stranded vector but instantly become double-stranded DNA on uncoating, resulting in improved transduction.
Initial experience with hepatic AAV- FIX gene transfer revealed the potential to activate CD8+ T-cell responses against the viral capsid, leading to hepatic injury and, in some cases, loss of transgene expression. This led to the incorporation of immune suppression in the clinical protocol. Steroid drugs are given as soon as a rise in liver enzyme levels is detected in the blood. Furthermore, vectors were designed with potentially immune stimulatory CpG motifs edited out of the DNA as much as possible, given that CD8+ T-cell activation has been linked to innate immune sensing of the viral DNA via toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9).
After preclinical efficacy and long-term follow-up studies in hemophilic mice and dogs and in non-human primates, followed by a series of early Phase I/II clinical trials and further preclinical development, there are now several AAV vectors in advanced clinical development for hemophilia. They all utilize hepatocyte-specific promoters but differ in capsid and also utilize different methods for vector production (such as transient transfection of human cells or baculovirus infection of insect cells). For FIX production, efficacy has been further improved by incorporation of a naturally occurring variant (FIX-Padua) that has an approximately eightfold higher enzymatic activity. Such vectors raised coagulation activity in patients with severe disease to around 30-50% of usual levels, close to the lower limit of the normal range. Thus, patients typically no longer require factor infusions, and dramatic reductions in annual bleeding rates (mostly none) are reported. These therapeutic benefits have persisted for at least 3 years, with more follow-up data pending. Notably, patients treated in an earlier trial with an AAV vector expressing FIX without the Padua mutation reached levels above 5% of normal that were sustained for at least 8 years. Two products expressing FIX-Padua have been developed. These are now being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials. Differences include capsids, vector genomes/expression cassette design, manufacturing systems and reported vector doses.
An AAV5 vector expressing FVIII in patients with hemophilia A, when given at very high doses (up to 10 vector genomes/kg), was able to normalize coagulation levels. Patients no longer required factor infusions and did not experience bleeds (annual bleeding rate of zero in 3 years of follow-up in a total of 12 patients). FVIII levels somewhat declined over time but were, on average, around 50% at the end of year 3. Mild elevation of liver enzymes occurred during the initial months after vector administration and, as a precaution, was countered by steroid administration; the underlying cause was not clear.
Several more vectors are being tested for hemophilia A and B, based on diverse capsids. One hope is that patients who are not eligible for a particular product because of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies will be able to receive a different product, based on a different capsid. Current gene therapies for hemophilia are exclusively for adults, and debate is ongoing whether gene transfer should also be offered to pediatric patients. AAV vector genomes tend to persist in episomal forms, so that there may be a dilution effect in a growing liver. Use of other vector systems or AAV combined with site-specific integration/ gene-editing technologies may solve this problem in the future. Alternatively, protocols for re-administration may become available, but these may require initial immune suppression. Interestingly, hepatic AAV gene transfer was able to induce immune tolerance to FVIII and FIX in different animal models, suggesting that gene therapy could also be used as a means to induce immune tolerance in patients who develop inhibitors during conventional factor-replacement therapy.
Cancer gene therapy
CAR-T therapy for lymphoma and leukemia. Adoptive lymphocyte therapy using gene-modified autologous T cells is one of the technologies revolutionizing cancer therapy. T cells are harvested from the patient's blood and transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) by ex vivo gene transfer using retroviral or lentiviral vectors (Figure 4.3). Early success has been shown with blood cancers. In pioneering work, CAR-T cells directed against the CD19 antigen were able to effectively kill lymphoma cells from patients refractory to conventional chemotherapy. CAR-T cells targeting CD19 are now approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of several types of blood cancer. These include: relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children and young adults; and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in adults.
CARs have a modular design and comprise an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv, the extracellular binding domain that targets the intact tumor surface antigen), a hinge region, a transmembrane domain and intracellular signaling domains. Expression of the CAR re-directs the T cells to the tumor antigen and provides the signals required for T-cell activation on binding to the antigen. Importantly, targeting of the intact antigen via scFv binding is neither MHC restricted nor dependent on co-receptors or epitope processing. CARs are broadly classified by the number of co-stimulatory domains that have been incorporated into the intracellular portion of the molecule. First-generation CARs contained only CD3zed chain, while second- or third-generation CARs have CD3zed plus one or more co-stimulatory domains, respectively (Figure 4.4). Current commercial designs are based on second-generation CARs. Future (fourth) generation CARs are being developed with inducible signaling.
CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL was approved in 2017 for children and young adults (up to age 25). The clinical study leading to approval demonstrated a complete remission rate of 60% and overall response rate of 81% in 75 patients receiving the anti-CD19 CAR-T cells. The relapse-free survival rate for the first 6 months was 80%, and B-cell aplasia (low numbers or absence of B cells) persisted. CAR-T cells continued to be detected in peripheral blood with a median lifespan of 168 days. Three of four patients experienced severe adverse events related to treatment, and about half developed severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS; see page 50).
Also in 2017, the first CAR-T cell therapy was approved for the treatment of DLBCL. In the trial supporting the approval, a complete remission rate of 58% and an overall response rate of 83% was achieved in 101 patients with refractory aggressive lymphoma. Compared with the B-ALL trial, the incidence of severe neurotoxicity (32%) was higher, while CRS was less common (11%). Interestingly, therapy was effective even in the face of histological findings that traditionally indicate poor prognosis. In a related trial, 40% of patients with DLBCL achieved complete and durable remission, leading to FDA approval for relapsed and refractory lymphoma in 2018.
More recent CAR-T cell therapies with potentially reduced toxicities are being evaluated in clinical trials. Further, other target antigens, such as CD22 for leukemia and B-cell maturation antigen in multiple myeloma, are being explored to expand the spectrum of CAR-T cell therapeutic applications.

9781908541680,ch_4,"Cardiometabolic consequences
Overweight/obesity as a whole predisposes to, or is associated with, numerous cardiac complications such as coronary heart disease (CHD), atrial fibrillation, heart failure and sudden cardiac death as a result of abnormalities in blood glucose, lipids, blood pressure, coagulation and inflammation. Independent of any of the other known cardiometabolic risk factors, obesity is associated with hypertension, tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy, increased collagen deposition, reduced cardiac contractility and increased end-diastolic pressure. The major circulatory complications are increased total and pulmonary blood volume, high cardiac output and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.
Metabolic syndrome
'Metabolic syndrome' describes the clustering in an individual of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, namely abdominal obesity (Figure 3.1), abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia and hypertension.
The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) updated the definition of metabolic syndrome in 2005, making abdominal obesity a requirement for a diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, and providing different obesity cut-off points for different ethnic groups. This definition takes account of the fact that central adiposity is common to each component of the metabolic syndrome. The criteria are summarized in Table 3.1.
Epidemiology. An estimated 20-30% of middle-aged individuals living in industrialized countries may be affected by the syndrome. According to some estimates, as many as 75 million people in the USA alone may exhibit the syndrome. Others suggest that as few as 30% of adults exhibit none of the major characteristics of metabolic syndrome.
Consequences. Metabolic syndrome is commonly a precursor of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, as well as many other associated conditions. Patients with metabolic syndrome are three times more likely to experience a heart attack or stroke than people without the syndrome, and are twice as likely to die as a result. They also have a fivefold greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Definition of the metabolic syndrome is of value because it ensures that any patient with a single cardiovascular risk factor, including obesity, is screened for the others, as their presence is statistically highly likely and coexistent cardiometabolic risks multiply the overall risk. It also ensures that a patient with multiple risk factors, even those considered borderline, is managed as a high-risk individual. The aim of management is to tackle the syndrome as a whole, and obesity in particular. Management of single or even multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, for example hypertension or hyperlipidemia alone, or even the combination of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension, is insufficient; the fundamental issues of excess and pathologically distributed body fat, exercise deficiency and a nutritionally poor diet require attention.
Not all commentators support the utility of the metabolic syndrome as a concept, and the many published definitions and criteria have served to confuse rather than inform. In addition, many other conditions with shared etiology, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; see Polycystic ovary syndrome) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; see Liver and gastrointestinal disorders), which are characterized by insulin resistance and excess and/or ectopic fat, are associated with increased cardiometabolic risk even though the criteria for the metabolic syndrome may not be met.
Insulin resistance is the common denominator for all the risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Insulin, produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, controls the uptake, intracellular utilization and storage of glucose, amino acids and fatty acids, while inhibiting catabolic processes such as the breakdown of glycogen, fat and protein. A major function is to stimulate the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle, where it is used as a source of energy. Insulin also has separate functions on adipose tissue, where it inhibits lipolysis - the breakdown of triglycerides - which releases fatty acids into the bloodstream. Individuals with metabolic syndrome have parallel insulin resistance in both muscles and adipose tissue, so in addition to the high insulin and glucose levels, the concentration of circulating fatty acids and dyslipidemia is also high.
Insulin resistance occurs when the tissues respond sluggishly to its action, causing blood glucose to rise, requiring more insulin to be produced to compensate - hyperinsulinemia. In the early stages of insulin resistance these physiological changes stimulate increased production of insulin, keeping glucose levels under control; with time, however, the feedback mechanisms become disrupted, glucose levels rise and type 2 diabetes mellitus ensues.
Effects of insulin resistance on other organs. Only the insulin receptors in liver, muscle and adipose tissue are abnormal in patients with insulin resistance; the other organs of the body have normal sensitivity but become overstimulated because of the high circulating levels of insulin, leading to further complications of metabolic syndrome. The kidneys respond to insulin by retaining salt, which leads to hypertension; 50% of people with high blood pressure have metabolic syndrome. The ability of the kidney to clear uric acid is also compromised, leading to hyperuricemia and gout.
The colon, breast, prostate and other organs are also affected, leading to increased cancer risk (see Chapter 4).
Management. The only logical way to treat one or more of the elements of metabolic syndrome in obese patients is to tackle the insulin resistance, either by weight loss or with specific pharmacotherapy.
Typically, 10% weight loss will result in:
50% reduction in fasting glucose
15% reduction in HbA 1c
8% increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
15% reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
30% reduction in triglycerides
10 mmHg reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Is weight loss always beneficial? Obesity, particularly when severe, is associated with an increase in mortality. The Framingham Heart Study estimated a reduced life expectancy of 5.8 and 7.1 years in 40-year-old obese men and women (non-smokers), respectively. The lowest mortalities occur in people who are normal weight or overweight and remain weight stable. For people who are overweight, gaining more weight increases mortality. Weight loss in cohort studies, particularly in older populations, has been associated with an increase in all-cause mortality but these data may be confounded by individuals with unintentional weight loss caused by an underlying disease process. Conversely, in controlled clinical trials, 5% weight loss as part of a healthy lifestyle intervention in people over the age of 65 has been associated with a reduction in mortality. It appears, therefore, that weight loss in and of itself may not necessarily confer benefit independent of an underlying condition, or adopting healthy eating behaviors and regular physical activity.
There is also a growing body of evidence supporting a so-called obesity paradox. Although obesity is an accepted risk factor for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, renal disease and dementia, its presence after diagnosis seems to be associated with more favorable outcomes, suggesting that the management of obesity should be tailored to the individual needs of each patient.
Diabetes mellitus
The link between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus is firmly established (Table 3.2; Figure 3.2). The risk of diabetes is magnified in individuals with:
abdominal rather than peripheral obesity (see Figure 3.1)
a family history of diabetes
gestational diabetes (and those whose mothers had gestational diabetes)
a history of excessive childhood weight gain.
Other factors predisposing to type 2 diabetes mellitus include smoking; lack of physical activity; high intake of sugared soft drinks, refined carbohydrate and saturated fat; and low intake of fiber.
Individuals of South Asian origin are more at risk from the comorbidities of obesity (including type 2 diabetes mellitus) at a lower body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference than their Caucasian counterparts. These ethnic differences are reflected in criteria such as the IDF definition of the metabolic syndrome (see Table 3.1). In Japan, 50% of 70 year olds with BMI >= 28 kg/m2 have type 2 diabetes mellitus. In some aboriginal communities the rate of diabetes is as high as 33%.
The lag phase between the onset of uncomplicated obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m) and the development of diabetes can be 10-12 years. However, the underlying pathological changes are already developing when the patient is overweight, even though outward signs and symptoms may remain undetected, and therefore the possibility of disordered glucose metabolism must be considered and looked for.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease. Moreover, recent data have clearly shown that aggressive early management confers the best chance to prevent, or at the very least substantially delay, both progression of the disease and emergence of cardiovascular and other complications. Once complications are established very tight control is less beneficial. Also see Fast Facts: Diabetes Mellitus.
Management of obese patients at risk of or with type 2 diabetes mellitus
Weight loss. Several major studies have shown that a modest reduction in weight by intensive lifestyle modification alone reduces the cumulative incidence of diabetes by 58% (Figure 3.3). Weight loss of 0.5-9.0 kg is associated with a 30-40% reduction in diabetes-related mortality.
Patients with diabetes have more difficulty losing weight than those without the condition - given optimum lifestyle advice and support, a diabetic person intent on weight reduction will lose about 50% of that managed by a non-diabetic in a year. However, 5-10% sustainable loss of bodyweight confers massive benefits to the individual: 10% loss of bodyweight equates to a reduction of 30% of the dangerous intra-abdominal fat. Regular and ongoing physical activity and a focus on healthy eating are essential for maintenance of weight loss.
Dietary management. An overall reduction in portion size and energy density is essential, and a regular pattern of meals - breakfast, lunch and dinner - is important; snacking should be avoided. Intake of saturated fat should be very low, and trans fats should be avoided completely. A reduction in overall carbohydrate intake is beneficial. Those carbohydrates that are consumed should be high in fiber. Sugar and other refined carbohydrates, such as fruit juices and sugar-sweetened drinks, are best avoided or consumed only rarely and in very small quantities. Artificial sweeteners are a reasonable alternative. Intake of carbohydrates with a low glycemic index (GI; see Low-fat, modified-carbohydrate diets) should be encouraged, as they have a more moderate effect on the postprandial increase in blood glucose. Dietary management of obesity is described in Chapter 5.
Physical activity. Regular physical activity reduces insulin resistance and protects against cardiometabolic disease even if weight is not lost. Both aerobic and resistance activities are beneficial. A reduction in sedentary activity is also important. For example, as much time as possible should be spent standing rather than sitting, and even very brief periods of intense activity are beneficial, particularly if undertaken regularly. Physical activity is discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.
Weight-loss drugs. Orlistat reduces fat mass and has effects on glucose regulation that are beneficial in the management of diabetes in obese patients. At present this is the only medication licensed for weight reduction. A number of agents are in development. The pharmacotherapy of obesity is discussed in Chapter 8.
Hypoglycemic agents. First-line pharmacological management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with obesity is with metformin (unless contraindicated). The introduction of several new agents has made the choice of second agent less obvious. Excess weight is the primary etiologic factor behind type 2 diabetes mellitus; weight gain can be demoralizing to patients, who are told that weight stability, or preferably loss, is their goal. The oral hypoglycemic agents that induce weight gain (see Table 2.2, Medications that cause weight gain, and 'weight friendly' alternatives) are therefore best considered third- or fourth-line treatments, particularly for obese patients.
Metformin. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated metformin to be an effective monotherapy for the treatment of obese patients with diabetes by improving insulin resistance and accordingly reducing plasma insulin and triglyceride levels without risk of hypoglycemia. The absolute reduction in HbA 1c was usually 0.6% more than by diet and lifestyle intervention alone. In the UKPDS, micro- and macrovascular complications were reduced by 32% in metformin recipients compared with lifestyle change alone. Metformin is the only oral hypoglycemic agent shown to reduce mortality.
Metformin can cause gastrointestinal upset, although this is minimized by the use of a slow-release formulation. Metformin-induced lactic acidosis is very rare, but for this reason the drug is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment or cardiac or hepatic failure.
In the setting of mild-to-moderate renal impairment, a low dose of metformin (maximum of 500 mg twice daily) is generally safe. There is no evidence to support the use of more than 2 g daily, and administration three times daily is not better than twice-daily dosing.
Sulfonylureas have been a traditional mainstay of oral hypoglycemic treatment, alone or in combination with metformin. However, there are concerns that they may advance beta-cell failure and therefore insulin dependency, and possibly reduce survival. During the initial stages of treatment, sulfonylureas induce more impressive reduction in HbA 1c than the alternatives, but this advantage is short lived. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of hypoglycemia.
Thiazolidinediones. The thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone (withdrawn from market in some countries) and pioglitazone act as agonists at the peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptor gamma and increase insulin sensitivity by activating genes involved in metabolism and fat synthesis. They induce significant improvements in glycemic control but increase body fat and cause weight gain and fluid retention. Adverse effects include heart failure and bone fractures.
Glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose reduce digestion of starch, slowing the postprandial increase in blood glucose. They may also increase the secretion of endogenous glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Acarbose has been shown to prevent progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes. Glucosidase inhibitors are most effective when used in conjunction with other oral hypoglycemics such as metformin. They do not lead to weight gain and do not by themselves confer a risk of hypoglycemia, although they may increase the risk of hypoglycemia if combined with sulfonylureas or insulin. Gastrointestinal side effects, in particular an increase in malodorous flatus, limit their use.
Incretin-based therapies
Hormones, in particular GLP-1, are produced in response to the presence of nutrients in the gut, particularly carbohydrate. They increase insulin and inhibit glucagon secretion while also slowing gastric emptying, increasing satiety and promoting nutrient utilization. These agents do not produce hypoglycemia.
GLP-1 receptor agonists (exempli gratia exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide) improve glycemic control and stabilize postprandial blood glucose by mimicking the actions of GLP-1. They induce significant weight loss, but are currently only available in injectable form, and often cause nausea. Pancreatitis may rarely occur. Long-acting formulations suitable for weekly administration are available.
Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin) inhibit the enzyme (DPP-4) responsible for the degradation of GLP-1, levels of which therefore increase postprandially. DPP-4 inhibitors are taken orally once or twice a day. They are not associated with hypoglycemia and have a neutral effect on weight. Pancreatitis is a rarely described complication.
Amylin mimetics (pramlintide) are synthetic analogs of amylin, a hormone synthesized in pancreatic beta cells, which is deficient in individuals with diabetes. Amylin slows gastric emptying, suppresses postprandial glucagon production and decreases hepatic glucose production. Pramlintide induces satiety and weight loss occurs, but it has to be administered by subcutaneous injection three times a day.
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, administered orally, inhibit glucose absorption in the renal proximal tubule. The expression of the glucose transporter SGLT2 increases in type 2 diabetes mellitus leading to increased glucose reabsorption. An increase in renal glucose excretion leads to a reduction in plasma glucose and improved glucose metabolism without causing hypoglycemia. SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with modest weight loss, improved lipid profile and lowering of blood pressure. Adverse effects predominantly relate to genital and lower urinary tract infections. Other safety considerations include changes in volume status, electrolytes and renal function. The future of this class of agents is uncertain following reports of an increase in urothelial cancers.
Bile acid sequestrants (colesevelam, colestimide) directly target intestinal L cells to increase circulating incretins and improve fasting and postprandial glucose metabolism. They have a neutral effect on weight. Colesevelam is licensed for this purpose in the USA, but not in Europe or Australia.
Bromocriptine quick release is a dopamine 2 (D2) receptor agonist that reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, probably via a vagally mediated central effect. It is currently licensed in the USA but not in Europe or Australia for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Insulin is recommended when satisfactory control of blood glucose cannot be achieved with oral hypoglycemic therapy and intensive efforts at appropriate diet and activity. To minimize the risk of an increase in weight, metformin, unless contraindicated, should be continued and a single dose of long-acting insulin used in the first instance.
Bariatric surgery (see Chapter 8) has a high success rate in patients with diabetes. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (see Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) is the optimal procedure for severely obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus because it results in up to 40-50% excess weight loss, the effects are durable in the long term and remission of diabetes occurs in up to 80% of patients, particularly if surgery is performed early in the course of the disease. The procedure increases postprandial GLP-1 and peptide YY concentrations, and reduces the basal ghrelin concentration. Provided adequate attention is paid to the long-term requirement for nutritional supplements there are few long-term complications.
PCOS is the most common endocrine disturbance in women: at least 11% of obese women with type 2 diabetes mellitus also have PCOS. Diagnostic criteria are given in Table 3.3, and investigations for PCOS in Table 3.4.
PCOS is characterized by androgenic effects, which may include acne, alopecia and hirsutism, typically of male distribution, including on the chin, upper lip, chest, back, abdomen, upper arms, thighs and buttocks. Ovulation is disordered, and oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea may occur.
Women with PCOS are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other related comorbidities, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and certain cancers.
Treatment. As insulin resistance is the main precursor to PCOS, the mainstays of treatment are dietary modification and increased physical activity, as described above and in Chapters 5 and. Insulin sensitizers, particularly metformin, have an important role; they may improve hyperandrogenism and can restore fertility. (Metformin is unlicensed in PCOS.)
A combined oral contraceptive may be prescribed to regulate the menstrual cycle and protect the endometrium by the induction of regular withdrawal bleeds. Ovulation and fertility can be induced in secondary care by anti-estrogens such as clomifene (clomiphene), although ultrasound monitoring is essential because of the risk of multiple pregnancy.
Hirsutism often improves with weight loss and increased physical activity together with the use of a combined oral contraceptive, which increases levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and lowers free androgen levels. Androgen receptor antagonists such as aldactone, where available, may be useful. Cosmetic therapies include electrolysis, waxing, bleaching and lasers. Eflornithine, which inhibits the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase in hair follicles, has been developed as a topical treatment.
Atherogenic dyslipidemia
Atherogenic dyslipidemia, also known as the 'lipid triad', refers to the specific lipid changes associated with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome:
moderately raised triglycerides
increased preponderance of small dense LDL particles
low levels of HDL cholesterol.
'The hypertriglyceridemic waist' has been proposed as the easiest way to identify high-risk patients in the clinic. The combination of abdominal obesity with raised plasma triglycerides identifies an individual at high risk for cardiovascular disease (Figure 3.4). Waist circumference and weight gain are the strongest predictors of early atherosclerosis in apparently healthy adults.
Epidemiology. Dyslipidemia develops progressively as BMI increases from 21 kg/m, increasing the risk of CHD by a factor of 3.6. It is estimated that about 38% of patients with a BMI above 27 kg/m have hypercholesterolemia. The Framingham study revealed that cholesterol increased by 0.3 mmol/L (12 mg/dL) for every 10% gain in weight. Up to 80% of patients with a waist measurement of at least 90 cm and a plasma triglyceride concentration above 2 mmol/L (177 mg/dL) possess the atherogenic combination of lipids that increases the risk of CHD by a factor of 20.
Measurement of apolipoproteins. While the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol expresses the overall risk of disease from dyslipidemia, it is now accepted that the ratio of apolipoprotein (apo)B (the primary protein constituent of LDL) to apoA1 (one of the major apolipoproteins in HDL) is a more precise measurement of atherogenic risk: a large number of small apoB particles is more atherogenic than a small number of large apoA1 particles. The number of particles can be assessed accurately in clinical trials by measuring apoB, as there is one molecule of apoB per LDL particle; a high apoB:apoA1 ratio expresses a high risk for CHD. Also see Fast Facts: Hyperlipidemia.
Weight loss significantly improves the lipid profile. Extensive Cochrane analyses have reported that a weight loss of 10 kg will induce a reduction in total cholesterol of about 0.25 mmol/L (9.75 mg/dL; approximately 5%). The American National Cholesterol Education Program reported that every 3 kg of diet-induced weight loss was accompanied by an increase in HDL cholesterol of 0.025 nmol/L (1 mg/dL), and it is widely accepted that 10% weight loss will induce a reduction in LDL cholesterol of approximately 15% and an increase in HDL of 8%, with a 10% fall in total cholesterol.
Figure 3.5 demonstrates improvement in lipid profile with weight loss, based on a meta-analysis of 70 studies. During weight loss, HDL levels decrease initially but then increase once weight loss has stabilized. Otherwise the greatest improvements in serum lipid concentrations tend to occur in the first 4-8 weeks of weight loss.
Dietary management. The effects of dietary changes are probably partly due to weight loss per se and partly to the effects of a more appropriate diet. The Finnish North Karelia study showed that a trebling in vegetable consumption over a 15-year period was accompanied by a substantial reduction in saturated fat intake, a substantial decline in salt intake and a 15% decrease in total serum cholesterol concentrations. Remarkably, however, these changes induced an increase, rather than a decrease, in the average BMI of the population, highlighting the importance of optimal nutrition in improving health.
Anti-obesity drug therapy in conjunction with lifestyle changes has been shown to improve lipid profiles in obese patients. Various studies have shown that orlistat reduces total and LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than weight loss alone.
Obesity, particularly severe obesity, or the presence of obesity-related comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are associated with increased plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and activation of the acute phase response, as reflected by levels of C-reactive protein. Although adipocytes themselves secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, they are predominantly produced by activated macrophages present in adipose tissue, particularly when it accumulates viscerally. A number of the cardiometabolic complications of obesity are likely to be caused, or at the very least exacerbated, by this pro-inflammatory state. In contrast, plasma levels of adiponectin, a cytokine derived from adipocytes that is associated with an antidiabetogenic effect, are lower in obese patients with insulin resistance. Levels decrease further as the metabolic state deteriorates and type 2 diabetes mellitus develops.
A diet high in saturated fat, the presence of OSA and psychosocial stress all aggravate the pro-inflammatory state.
The prothrombotic state
The prothrombotic state linked with obesity and the metabolic syndrome refers to changes in coagulation factors that promote increased blood viscosity and hypercoagulability, arterial thrombosis and inflammation, and increasing plaque and thrombus formation in the arterial wall. The prothrombotic state is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, enhanced LDL oxidation, promotion of platelet aggregation, activation of factor VII, and increases in factors IX and X, prothrombin and plasminogen activation inhibitor-1. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha may also play a role in atherogenic dyslipidemia and inflammation.
Obesity is a risk factor for the development of hypertension. Blood pressure should therefore be measured as part of the screening process once an individual is identified as being overweight. It should be measured with a sufficiently large cuff designed for obese individuals (otherwise the reading will be abnormally high), which should be readily accessible in order to avoid embarrassment to patient and physician.
Epidemiology. More than 85% of patients with hypertension have a BMI of 25 kg/m or more. The risk of hypertension is increased fivefold among obese people compared with their lean counterparts, and in up to two-thirds blood pressure is raised as a direct consequence of excess weight. Individuals who are 20% overweight have an eightfold chance of developing hypertension. The Framingham study showed that each 4.5 kg weight gain led to an increase in systolic blood pressure of about 4.3 mmHg; 15% gain in weight was associated with an 18% increase in systolic blood pressure.
The Physicians' Health Study, which observed 13500 normotensive men, discovered that 4920 participants developed hypertension after a median 14.5 years. Higher baseline BMI, even within the 'normal' range, was consistently associated with increased risk of hypertension. The Asia-Pacific Cohort Collaboration Study, which involved 26-33 cohorts of more than 300000 adults followed up for almost 7 years, showed that each unit change in BMI was associated with a 9% difference in ischemic heart disease events, and a change of about 8% in hypertension-related deaths and ischemic strokes.
In a cohort of 2751 men and women over 40 years of age, abdominal fat mass was the best predictor of stroke in women, whereas the ratio of gynoid fat to total fat mass was associated with a decreased risk of stroke. However, in a subgroup analysis abdominal fat was not a significant predictor after further adjustment for diabetes, smoking and hypertension.
A study of 20000 male and a similar number of female high-school students revealed hemodynamic abnormalities - hypertension and raised heart rate - in obese adolescents. Increases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with high resting heart rate, and this observed clustering increased with the degree of obesity, probably explained by impaired autonomic nerve function.
It is clear from studies such as these that screening of obese individuals for possible covert hypertension should be a priority, and will identify a large number of high-risk individuals whose risk can be successfully modified, and death prevented, by appropriate lifestyle changes and drug treatment.
Mechanism of obesity-related hypertension. Increased renal sodium reabsorption and blood volume expansion are central features in the development of obesity-related hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia leads to renal salt retention. Overweight is also associated with increased sympathetic activity, an effect that may be mediated by leptin, a protein expressed in and secreted by adipocytes (see Chapter 2). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has also been causally implicated in obesity-related hypertension, partly because of activation by increased sympathetic activity, and perhaps also because angiotensinogen is expressed in and secreted by adipose tissue. Low levels of the adipocyte-derived cytokine adiponectin, high circulating levels of free fatty acids and increased vascular production of endothelin-1 have also been implicated in mediating the effect of obesity to increase blood pressure, although recent studies have suggested that BMI, in the absence of diabetes, does not affect plasma adiponectin levels.
Dietary factors are also important: excess intake of saturated fats and refined carbohydrates increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Salt intake is more likely to be associated with hypertension in obesity.
Weight loss through dietary modification and increased physical activity is the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of both obesity and hypertension, whether they occur alone or together. Caloric restriction, reduced intake of refined carbohydrate and saturated fat, very low salt intake and increased fiber intake (from whole grains, salads, vegetables and fruit) are beneficial, regardless of weight. Reductions of 1 mmHg in systolic pressure and 2 mmHg in diastolic pressure for each 1% reduction in weight have been reported.
Pharmacotherapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel blockers can be used in conjunction with weight loss for the treatment of high blood pressure in obese individuals. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been associated with favorable metabolic properties and end-organ protection in addition to their antihypertensive effects. Beta-blockers should be avoided because of the risk of weight gain. A recent trial showed that the adjusted mean bodyweight in patients treated with beta-blockers was 9.2 kg higher among those attending a diabetes clinic, probably due to reduced energy expenditure.
Other cardiac complications
Even in the absence of metabolic complications obesity is associated with impaired ventricular systolic and diastolic function and atrial dilatation. Atrial fibrillation and cardiac failure (obesity-related cardiomyopathy) have been shown to have an independent relationship with obesity, as well as being the consequences of obesity-related comorbidities including hypertension, OSA, cardiac ischemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The benefits of aggressive risk factor management are augmented by weight loss.","<BULL> Obesity significantly affects cardiometabolic status and risk. <BULL> The metabolic syndrome defines the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors under the umbrella of obesity. <BULL> Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the comorbidity most closely linked with obesity.
