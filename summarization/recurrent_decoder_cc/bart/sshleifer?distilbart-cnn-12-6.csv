9781908541277,ch_12,"Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life. The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures. Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures. When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients. Patients with epilepsy may have difficulty in finding affordable life insurance. Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures without unduly limiting activities."," Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy. Depression is under-recognized and, when diagnosed, often undertreated. Suicide rate in depressed patients with epilepsy is five times higher than that in the general population. SSRIs and benzodiazepines are most often used, but no studies in patients with epilepsy have been reported.

9781910797907,chp6,"The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors. The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. Some patients with PK deficiency may tolerate a lower level of hemoglobin than those with other anemias due to increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Splenectomy is beneficial in increasing the hemoglobin level and decreasing the need for transfusions in most patients with PK deficiency. Given the potential risks associated with splenectomy, physicians should participate in shared decision making with their patients to determine whether to pursue splenectomy and at what age. The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis in PK deficiency is similar (approximately 10%) to other non-malignant hematologic conditions."," The main focus of care for pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is with supportive therapies. Red blood cell transfusions are frequently used to support patients with PK deficiency. There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals. The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin.

9781908541024,ch_12,"There are several syndromes associated with an inherited predisposition to a variety of brain tumors. However, the vast majority of brain tumors are not inherited. Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate surveillance of individuals at high risk of developing an occult brain tumor or associated disease and for genetic counseling. Recent advances in the molecular biology of familial brain tumor syndromes have suggested new therapies that have the potential to dramatically change the manifestations of these diseases. Cysts are common imaging findings; location, imaging characteristics and other features may help to establish the most likely diagnosis. Dermoids and epidermoids are benign congenital lesions that typically produce symptoms as they gradually increase in size. Total or subtotal resection is the treatment of choice. Colloid cysts should be resected using modern microneuro-surgical techniques."," The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial. The etiology of sporadic brain tumors is unknown, but environmental factors are suspected. Most cases of confirmed familial cancers are multigenerational and affected individuals are younger than average for the tumor. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is almost universally surgical, but recent trials using antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab for acoustic schwannomas have shown regression of these tumors.

Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy. Increased use of relievers (short-acting beta -agonists) indicates inadequate disease control. Asthma therapy should be tailored to disease severity; current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment. Any exacerbation should prompt a review of maintenance medications.

As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen. The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy. The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone is now also licensed for use before chemotherapy, and trials of other antiandrogens prior to chemotherapy are under way. When docetaxel chemotherapy has failed, second-line therapies such as cabazitaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone (a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis), enzalutamide (an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor) and radium-223 (targeted alpha therapy) have been shown to improve survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy for CRPC may be best implemented before significant symptoms appear. The monoclonal antibody denosumab and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have been reported to significantly delay bone-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer. External-beam radiotherapy may provide useful control of pain from bone metastases."," An increase in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level after initially successful androgen deprivation almost inevitably indicates impending clinical progression. Men with CRPC are a heterogeneous group, ranging from men with increasing PSA only and no demonstrable metastases to those who have many bone and/or visceral metastases.
