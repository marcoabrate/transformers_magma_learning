9781910797631,chp6,"Prevention and management. By far the most research attention has been paid to the treatment of depression, with relatively few studies focusing on approaches to prevent its onset. However, knowledge derived from epidemiology and predictive studies has provided a basis for identifying people who are at increased risk of becoming depressed, and for tackling a range of psychosocial risk factors that are implicated in depression onset. Preventive strategies may be directed toward. the whole population - 'universal prevention'. selected high-risk groups - 'selective prevention'. people who have already developed some clinical features but not the full-blown disorder - 'indicated prevention'. Universal prevention. An area where universal programs appear to be beneficial is mental health promotion for young people using a whole-school approach. The most recent review findings (2017) indicate that such programs have modest beneficial effects, which appear to be maintained at 12-month follow-up. Universal programs have also sought to improve 'mental health literacy' (public knowledge and beliefs about mental health and mental disorders) to assist the recognition and professional or self-management of problems, and so address the high level of unmet need in this area. Initiatives have been conducted in many countries including the USA, UK, Germany, Norway and, most extensively, Australia, and have mostly involved mass media health campaigns. The forms of psychological therapy best supported by current evidence are CBT, behavioral activation and IPT. In addition, electroconvulsive therapy is a well-established treatment with good evidence for effectiveness in severe depression; it is generally reserved for those who have not responded to other treatment or when the condition is potentially life-threatening. Self-help treatment options. Several other approaches have benefits for particular levels or presentations of depression - there is some evidence to support the use of exercise, relaxation training and a range of self-help approaches, as well as befriending, for milder levels. Exposure to light is effective for seasonal affective disorder and may be useful as an adjunct to other treatments for non-seasonal depression. Complementary therapies. Some complementary treatments may be useful - there is evidence that the herbal treatment St John's wort is equivalent to standard antidepressants in mild and moderate depression (although there are important problems that limit its usefulness, which are discussed on page 95). The nutritional supplement omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be useful as an adjunctive treatment for depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder but the effect is uncertain for unipolar depression. Studies of acupuncture for depression have shown mixed results: compared with sham control there is little evidence of benefit, but there may be an additive benefit when acupuncture is combined with medication. The effectiveness of individual treatments is clearly important in tackling depression, but much depends on the way that services are organized and enabled to respond to the variability of depression presentation and need for support within populations. Hence the development and evaluation of ways of delivering services is a key part of depression management. Current evidence suggests that better outcomes could be achieved if primary care practices were better organized to identify and respond to those experiencing depression. Stepped care is a model of healthcare based on matching treatments of differing intensity to the needs of the individual, so that the least restrictive approaches (in terms of intensity, inconvenience and cost) are used. Allied with this is the systematic monitoring of progress so that management can be altered (stepped up) if response is inadequate. This way of organizing practice involves standardizing the procedures and indications, and it has been used for the management of diverse conditions from migraine and back pain to diabetes and hypertension. More recently, it has been advocated for mental health problems such as anxiety, bulimia and depression. Monitoring use of antidepressants. For people whose symptoms respond poorly to antidepressants, reviewing side effects, treatment preferences and adherence is warranted. Many people discontinue their antidepressant treatment before the recommended adequate treatment period (6 months continuation after symptom remission): findings from the USA indicate that 42% of patients stop taking antidepressants within the first month of prescribing, and 72% within the first 3 months. Patient education. Communication between clinician and patient about how antidepressants work (psychoeducation), especially that they need to be taken daily (and not just when feeling depressed) for at least 2 weeks before a response will be seen, and discussing treatment concerns (such as worries that antidepressants may be addictive), risk and experience of side effects, and likelihood of relapse, are helpful in facilitating treatment adherence. Suicidal ideas and acts may be increased in the early stages of antidepressant treatment. This is a small but very important effect that is most evident in children and adolescents but remains for those aged below 25 years. Careful consideration of treatment options and close monitoring of people at risk of suicide is essential. If antidepressants are used for people judged to be at risk of suicide, frequent monitoring and reviews are essential. Direct contact is recommended within 1 week of prescribing and thereafter at regular intervals depending on the level of risk and response to treatment. Telephone reviews may usefully supplement direct contacts. The quantity and toxicity of the prescribed antidepressant is an important consideration, and judgment of risk by assessing depression features, conducting a comprehensive suicide risk assessment (Table 6.5), and consideration of social situation and supports are all key factors in deciding whether to involve specialist mental health services.","The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods. For milder forms of depression, self-help, relaxation, sleep hygiene, exercise and problem-solving therapy are likely to be effective; for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants or a structured psychological treatment (cognitive-behavior therapy) is indicated; combined antidepressants and psychological therapy may be most appropriate for severe depression. There are a range of treatments that may be effective for depression, and matching management intensity to the level of depression severity - termed 'stepped care' - is a widely adopted framework for care. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the first-choice medication but prior treatment history, medical history and drug interactions are key considerations in treatment selection. Depression is complex, and understanding and helping requires a sensitive weighing up of the many factors that are relevant to the individuals and families affected."," Preventive strategies may be directed toward the whole population - 'universal prevention' selected high-risk groups -'selective prevention' people who have already developed some clinical features but not the full-blown disorder - 'indicated prevention' Universal programs have also sought to improve'mental health literacy'  The forms of psychological therapy best supported by current evidence are CBT, behavioral activation and IPT.

9781910797426,ch03,"Epidemiology and risk factors. Gallstones are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age; women are at higher risk than men. In the USA, 5-8% of men and 13-26% of women have gallstones. Native Americans have the highest prevalence in North America, with more than 70% of Pima Indian women having gallstones; African-Americans have the lowest prevalence. European studies have reported the prevalence of gallstones to be about 10% in men and 20% in women, figures that increase to 30% and 40% respectively in older patients. Other risk factors for gallstones are given in Table 3.1. Symptoms and signs include pain or tenderness and guarding in the right upper quadrant, nausea and vomiting, fever, fast pulse (tachycardia) and a positive Murphy's sign (transient cessation of breathing due to pain during inspiration while the right upper quadrant is palpated, but not the left upper quadrant). Complications include empyema, perforation of the gallbladder, liver abscess and emphysematous cholecystitis. An inflamed and distended gallbladder may obstruct the main bile duct by pressure from a gallstone causing obstructive jaundice (Mirizzi's syndrome). Laboratory tests. Leukocytosis and mild elevation in serum bilirubin and transaminases may be present. Transabdominal ultrasonography is the most useful test for acute cholecystitis as it establishes the presence of gallstones (Figure 3.5). A thickened gallbladder wall (> 4 mm) and pericholecystic fluid are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.6). Sonographic Murphy's sign (tenderness over the gallbladder from the ultrasound transducer during imaging) is also diagnostic. Radionuclide scanning is a useful test if ultrasound is non-diagnostic or inconclusive but there is clinical suspicion of acute cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan uses a technetium-labeled analog of iminodiacetic acid. Non-visualization of the gallbladder with visualization of the tracer in the CBD and the small intestine is consistent with cystic duct obstruction. This test is about 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Computed tomography is useful for identifying local complications of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.7). Medical treatment of acute cholecystitis involves. Epidemiology and risk factors. Acalculous cholecystitis is associated with a myriad of clinical conditions and frequently occurs in critically ill patients, with the incidence in this group ranging from 0.5 to 18%. There are many predisposing risk factors (Table 3.2). Symptoms and signs. The usual scenario consists of abdominal pain, fever and leukocytosis in a patient with one of the above predisposing conditions. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Right upper quadrant tenderness and Murphy's sign may be present, and a palpable mass may be detected in a minority of patients. Jaundice is not uncommon. Treatment. Cholecystectomy is indicated for polyps greater than 1 cm, for polyps with associated gallstones and for patients with biliary symptoms. Solitary sessile polyps that are 5-10 mm in size are more likely to be neoplastic than small, multiple, pedunculated, hyperechoic polyps. Cholecystectomy should be considered if a neoplastic polyp is suspected. Follow-up. Observation with serial imaging is an option for small polyps that are considered to be at low risk for neoplastic features. Polyps that increase in size on serial imaging are an indication for cholecystectomy. Etiology and pathogenesis. Chronic gallbladder inflammation is attributed as an etiologic factor in gallbladder cancer along with molecular alterations in p53 and K-ras. Inflammation may occur as a result of gallstones, gallbladder polyps, chronic Salmonella infection, congenital biliary cysts, abnormal pancreaticobiliary duct junction, carcinogen exposure and certain drugs. There are molecular differences between gallbladder cancers associated with gallstones and those with an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction. Epidemiology and risk factors. Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and is the most common GI cancer in Native Americans. Incidence and mortality are very high in certain Latin American countries, especially Chile. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer are outlined in Table 3.3. The majority of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinomas.","The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age, and women are at higher risk than men. Transabdominal ultrasound is the imaging test of choice, with an accuracy of over 95%, for the diagnosis of gallstones in either acute or chronic cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Acalculous cholecystitis may occur in critically ill patients; the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.

Not surprisingly then, mood states and psychiatric comorbidities substantially contribute to the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. The three most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are depression, anxiety and psychosis. Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up to 55% of patients in some studies - and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than seizure-specific variables such as seizure frequency and severity. Nearly 1 in 3 patients reports significant concern about their mood. Not surprisingly then, mood states and psychiatric comorbidities substantially contribute to the quality of life of patients with epilepsy.

Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up to 55% of patients in some studies - and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than seizure-specific variables such as seizure frequency and severity. Few controlled trials of antidepressants have been conducted in patients with epilepsy and depression. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line treatments, especially citalopram and sertraline, which have minimal pharmacokinetic interactions with AEDs. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can be given as second-line therapy. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and non-TCAs are probably best avoided. Clomipramine and lithium are more likely to worsen seizure frequency than other antidepressants. Electroconvulsive therapy is not absolutely contraindicated in patients with epilepsy but should be reserved for medication-resistant depression. In addition to antidepressants, contributing psychosocial factors should be sought and addressed by qualified professionals (see Fast Facts: Depression). Psychosis. The incidence of psychosis varies according to the epilepsy syndrome, from 3.3% in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy to 14% in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, it correlates with epilepsy severity: psychosis occurs in 0.6-7% of patients with epilepsy in the community and 19-27% of patients with epilepsy who require hospitalization. Ictal psychosis presents as hallucinations or delusions. Symptoms are usually self-limiting and can be mistaken for schizophrenia or mania, but unlike a primary psychiatric disorder are associated with a pattern of non-convulsive status epilepticus on electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Postictal psychosis generally begins years after the onset of epilepsy. The typical pattern is a cluster of complex partial seizures, followed by a lucid postictal period. In turn, this lucid period is followed by affective symptoms together with grandiose and religious delusions, as well as simple auditory hallucinations. Patients with bilateral seizure foci, bilateral limbic lesions and clusters of complex partial seizures are at particularly high risk. Clinicians should encourage their patients to work whenever possible and to recommend they seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. In the USA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was amended in 2008 to further protect the rights of persons with epilepsy, protects a person from being denied employment because of a medical condition if that person can perform the essential duties of that job. In the UK, in line with several other European countries, a similar Disabilities Discrimination Act was introduced in 1995 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in employment. Whether patients should disclose their epilepsy before being hired is best dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Driving is often viewed as essential to holding a job and living independently. However, as driving is a privilege, applicants must meet the requirements established by their state, province or country to qualify for a driver's license. With reference to epilepsy, these requirements usually specify a seizure-free interval necessary for driving, the obligations of the patient and the physician to notify the authorities of the patient's status, and allowances that are made under certain circumstances such as seizures that only occur during sleep or seizures that occur during a physician-prescribed AED taper. Clinicians should be thoroughly familiar with the applicable laws where they practice, and should clearly document their discussions with patients. Clinicians should also remember that side effects of AEDs, especially sedation, may interfere with a patient's ability to safely operate a vehicle, and should advise patients accordingly. Life insurance. Patients with epilepsy may be unable to find affordable life insurance, particularly if applying for an individual policy. Most insurance companies ascribe a globally higher risk of mortality to people with seizures, irrespective of the applicant's frequency or severity of seizures. Patients who obtain life insurance through their place of employment generally do not have a problem. Lifestyle considerations. Clinicians should counsel patients on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures and help maintain overall health without unduly limiting activities that bring enjoyment and fulfillment. Reducing or eliminating the consumption of alcohol, engaging in stress-reducing behaviors, eating regularly and getting adequate sleep may help to reduce seizure frequency. Regular aerobic exercise, especially conducted in such a way that having a seizure would not pose a safety risk, is important for general maintenance of health as well as bone health. Participation in organized sports is generally possible, though the possibility of concussion should be minimized and athletes should consider discussing their condition with team trainers and doctors in advance.","Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life. The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures. When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures. Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients.

9781910797907,chp6,"When to transfuse. There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals., The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. As explained in Chapter 1, an increase in red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate results in enhanced oxygen off-loading into the tissues. Consequently, patients may tolerate moderately severe anemia with few symptoms. When patients have a transfusion, the goal nadir hemoglobin level should also be based on symptoms rather than on a level extrapolated from guidelines used in other anemias. Many patients with PK deficiency will never need a transfusion or will only require intermittent, or unplanned, transfusions during hemolytic crises due to infections or an aplastic crisis associated with parvovirus infection. Others may remain on regular transfusion therapy until splenectomy is considered. Hemoglobin goals. During the first years of life, hemoglobin goals are those that allow for normal growth and development, and young children are often reliant on frequent transfusions to decrease symptoms and improve growth. As individuals age through adulthood, transfusion requirements may increase despite a stable hemoglobin, as a result of increased symptoms from the anemia, perhaps related to increased daily activity. Patient selection. Preoperative assessment of red cell survival, splenic sequestration and/or spleen size is of no value in selecting patients for splenectomy. In part, this reflects the importance of the liver as a site of RBCl destruction. Low pre-splenectomy hemoglobin levels are associated with a poorer response to splenectomy in terms of the post-splenectomy hemoglobin rise and/or transfusion burden. The burden of transfusions in PK deficiency varies between patients. The decision whether to have a splenectomy to improve the anemia of PK deficiency is complex and depends on both the physician's and the patient's perspective of the potential benefits and risks. Recent guidelines recommend splenectomy in patients who are reliant on regular transfusions or are severely anemic. Splenectomy should also be considered in patients who receive intermittent transfusions with every infectious illness or who have symptomatic anemia.

The timing of splenectomy is based on the risk-benefit assessment. Splenectomy in young children is associated with an increased risk of post-splenectomy sepsis, while a delay in splenectomy in patients who receive regular transfusions is associated with increased iron loading.

Post-splenectomy thrombosis. Many studies demonstrate an overall increased risk of thrombosis after splenectomy, including in otherwise healthy individuals. After splenectomy, the overall risk of thrombosis in PK deficiency is approximately 10%, including portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and central nervous system thrombosis. Although the etiology for the increased risk is not clear, some physicians recommend taking low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after splenectomy, particularly in patients with marked thrombocytosis, to potentially decrease this risk.","The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. Some patients with PK deficiency may tolerate a lower level of hemoglobin than those with other anemias due to increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors. Splenectomy is beneficial in increasing the hemoglobin level and decreasing the need for transfusions in most patients with PK deficiency. Given the potential risks associated with splenectomy, physicians should participate in shared decision making with their patients to determine whether to pursue splenectomy and at what age. The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis in PK deficiency is similar (approximately 10%) to other non-malignant hematologic conditions."," There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals.

9781908541277,ch_8,"Modern antiepileptic drugs. After a hiatus of nearly 20 years, 16 new AEDs and two devices - the vagus nerve stimulator and deep brain stimulator - have received licenses for the adjunctive treatment of refractory epilepsy, the last so far only in Europe. Gabapentin (GBP), lacosamide (LCM), LTG, levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC), pregabalin (PGB), tiagabine (TGB), TPM and zonisamide (ZNS) are widely available for partial seizures. Rufinamide (RFN) has been licensed in Europe and the USA for adjunctive treatment of seizures in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is licensed in Europe as adjunctive treatment for partial seizures with or without secondary generalization. Retigabine (RTG; ezogabine in the USA) and perampanel (PER) have recently been approved for use in Europe and the USA for the same indication. After 20 years of global experience, vigabatrin (VGB) has been approved in the USA for the treatment of infantile spasms and as add-on therapy for drug-resistant complex partial seizures. However, the use of VGB has also been markedly restricted because of reports of concentric visual field defects in up to 40% of patients. Stiripentol (STP) was licensed in 2001 for the adjunctive treatment of Dravet syndrome in Europe via the orphan drugs system. A similar arrangement has taken place in the USA for CLB in the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This drug has been available elsewhere in the world since the 1970s. The progress of felbamate (FBM) has been dramatically curtailed because of the unusual development of idiosyncratic life-threatening bone-marrow and liver toxicities. The advent of these newer agents has provided many more options in the management of refractory epilepsy, although whether overall outcomes have improved substantially is debatable. Indications. OXC has a similar spectrum of efficacy to CBZ against partial and tonic-clonic seizures. It tends to be better tolerated than CBZ with fewer neurotoxic side effects. Dosage. The recommended starting dose for OXC in adults is 150-600 mg daily in two doses. The dose can be titrated upwards as clinically indicated to 3000-4000 mg daily. A starting dose of 5 mg/kg daily in children over 3 years of age can be prescribed, increasing gradually to a maintenance dose of about 30 mg/kg daily. Patients already on CBZ may be switched immediately to OXC using a dosage ratio of 1.5 OXC to 1 CBZ. Particular care in immediate switching needs to be taken when the daily CBZ dose exceeds 1200 mg. Plasma concentrations of the clinically active metabolite of OXC increase linearly with dose. No studies, however, have attempted to relate elevated plasma levels to efficacy or toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. VGB does not interfere with hepatic metabolic enzymes, but produces a small reduction in PHT levels of around 20% by an unknown mechanism. Zonisamide (ZNS) is a sulfonamide derivative, chemically and structurally unrelated to other AEDs. It blocks voltage-dependent sodium and T-type calcium channels, and actively inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Although probably not a major contributor to its pharmacological effect, a weak inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity may contribute to its side-effect profile.","Sixteen new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy since the late 1980s. This wider choice of AEDs permits pharmacological treatment to be better matched to the individual patient's circumstances.

VGB does not interfere with hepatic metabolic enzymes, but produces a small reduction in PHT levels of around 20% by an unknown mechanism.",17.1875,42.30769230769231,24.444444444444443,3.149606299212598,7.8431372549019605,4.49438202247191,12.5,30.76923076923077,17.77777777777778,64.24521207809448,58.00485014915466
9781910797006,ch08,"Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly those that result in hospitalization, place a large burden on healthcare resources. It has been estimated that, in an average UK Health Authority with a population of 250 000, there will be 14 200 consultations with a primary care physician and 680 hospital admissions for exacerbations of COPD each year. In the UK, respiratory admissions account for 25% of all acute emergency admissions, and COPD accounts for more than half of these, representing more than 200 000 hospital admissions per year. Recent studies have suggested that up to 50% of patients do not report exacerbations, so the true frequency is much higher than the number of consultations with primary care physicians suggests. Thus, the healthcare burden imposed by exacerbations of COPD is enormous. Annual costs in the USA are estimated at nearly $29.5 billion and $20.4 billion in direct and indirect costs, respectively. The comparable annual figure in the EU is €80 billion in total costs. Since exacerbations increase in frequency and require a greater level of care as COPD progresses, most costs are incurred towards the end stage of the disease. General healthcare costs are also increased in patients with COPD, emphasizing the multisystem problems faced by this patient group. Surrogate markers of inflammation, such as sputum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6, have been shown to be elevated in exacerbations of COPD. Oxidative stress is a major component of airway inflammation in COPD. Surrogate markers of oxidative stress are known to be elevated, compared with levels in healthy smokers, in the blood and exhaled breath of patients with stable COPD, and are further increased during exacerbations of COPD. The main etiologic factors in exacerbations of COPD are thought to be bacterial and viral infections, and air pollutants. Other factors associated with exacerbations of COPD are social deprivation and changes in temperature. However, in around 30% of exacerbations of COPD, no obvious etiologic factor is found. The use of mucolytic agents in COPD has been evaluated in a number of studies. The effects on the frequency of exacerbations have been mixed. There is, however, some evidence that, in patients with COPD who have not been treated with an inhaled corticosteroid, mucolytics may reduce exacerbations. The aims of management in exacerbations of COPD are to relieve airway obstruction, correct hypoxemia, address any comorbid disorder that may contribute to respiratory deterioration and treat any precipitating causes such as infection. Management at home. Most exacerbations of COPD are treated in primary care; only a minority of patients are admitted to hospital. Bronchodilators. The dose and the frequency of use of bronchodilators are increased in home management of exacerbations of COPD. If not already used, therapy with multiple bronchodilator classes may be added if symptoms are not improving. In the most severe cases, high-dose nebulized bronchodilators can be given on a regular or as-required basis for several days. However, there is evidence that the use of multiple doses of bronchodilators by metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device has an effect similar to that of nebulized bronchodilators in exacerbations of COPD. When a nebulizer is used, it is probably safer to use air as the driving gas, rather than oxygen, and to continue oxygen therapy via nasal prongs. The long-term use of nebulized therapy after acute exacerbations of COPD is not routinely recommended. Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve lung function effectively in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Currently, systemic corticosteroid, 40 mg/day for 5 days, is recommended for all patients with an acute exacerbation in the absence of significant contraindications. Oral corticosteroids are preferable. Nebulized budesonide is an alternative to oral corticosteroid treatment in exacerbations without respiratory failure and is associated with a reduction in complications, such as hyperglycemia. Corticosteroids should be discontinued after the acute episode; clinical improvement with corticosteroids during the exacerbation does not indicate the need for long-term treatment with oral or inhaled corticosteroids. The objectives of mechanical ventilatory support in patients with exacerbations of COPD are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and relieve symptoms. Ventilatory support includes both non-invasive ventilation using negative or positive pressure devices and invasive mechanical ventilation by endotracheal intubation. Non-invasive intermittent ventilation has been shown in several randomized control trials in acute respiratory failure in COPD to reduce respiratory acidosis, the severity of breathlessness, the length of stay in hospital, the need for intubation and mortality. However, non-invasive ventilation is not appropriate for all patients (Table 8.7).","Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and place a huge burden on healthcare resources. The main etiologic factors in acute exacerbations are bacterial infection, respiratory viruses and air pollution. Most exacerbations of COPD are managed at home, but those with suspected respiratory failure should be admitted to hospital. Treatment includes oxygen, increased use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and short-term oral glucocorticosteroids. Exacerbations can be prevented by inhaled corticosteroids and vaccination against influenza. Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure."," In the UK, respiratory admissions account for 25% of all acute emergency admissions, and COPD accounts for more than half of these.

9781910797105,ch06,"Morphological findings. MRI studies confirmed the previous findings of enlarged ventricles, with patients exhibiting about a one-third increase in ventricular volume compared with controls (Figure 6.1), and increased sulcal widening (Figure 6.2). MRI studies demonstrated for the first time the involvement of cortical and subcortical gray matter structures. Specifically, people with schizophrenia were shown to exhibit decreased volume of the neocortex, by about 5%, with specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. These brain regions are the neuroanatomic substrate for the complex cognitive behaviors that are disrupted in schizophrenia. In addition to volume reductions in these areas, several studies have found that people with schizophrenia have a reversal or loss of the normal asymmetry of these structures. Progression of brain changes. A series of longitudinal studies involving multiple MRI has evaluated whether schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with fixed morphological abnormalities, or a neurodegenerative disorder, with progressive changes in brain structure. These studies, conducted in childhood-onset, first-episode and chronic patient populations, have consistently demonstrated 2-10% decreases in cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes and 5-10% increases in ventricular volume. The extent to which these results apply to a subgroup or to the total schizophrenia population is unknown. The possible progression of brain changes would be consistent with increased functional disability and cognitive decrements observed in a proportion of people with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown consistently that superior and medial frontal structural changes occur in young people at clinical high risk if they make the transition to full psychosis compared with those who do not. Morphological changes associated with specific symptoms. Several studies have observed an association between decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) gray matter and hallucinations and delusions or positive formal thought disorder. Hallucinations and delusions are more frequently associated with decreased volume of the anterior STG, and positive formal thought disorder with decreased volume of the posterior STG. MRI has also been used to show that people with schizophrenia have a loss of the normal asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres, especially of the planum temporale, a region of the brain involved in audition and language.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on the diffusion of water through different brain tissues and allows for the evaluation of white matter integrity. In addition, DTI may be used to identify and measure specific white matter fiber tracts (Figure 6.4). DTI studies have documented widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy (a measure of white matter integrity) in the white matter of people with schizophrenia, but the localization of the abnormalities has differed across studies. In addition, multiple fiber tracts have been shown to be characterized by reduced fractional anisotropy. Several studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia with persistent negative symptoms have decreased fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts associated with social cognition. In combination with functional imaging, genetic and postmortem studies, DTI studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a dysconnection syndrome, characterized by abnormal connectivity among the different cortical and subcortical brain regions.","People with schizophrenia exhibit gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. A subgroup of patients may exhibit progressive changes in brain structure over the course of their illness. People with schizophrenia have decreased volume of subcortical structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus and thalamus.

9783318068207,hh-5,"The recent improvements in terms of available technologies and bioinformatics tools have allowed a better understanding of the pathobiology of different tumor types and the identification of several genomic alterations that may be targetable. CGP offers a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor for both prognostic and predictive purposes, helping oncologists make decisions about cancer treatment. The adoption of broad NGS gene panels (Table 3.1) may support the administration of immunotherapy drugs in patients harboring high TMB (see page 45). Another potentially valuable approach is hybrid capture-based CGP, an ultra-sensitive assay that can be used to detect variants even in specimens with low tumor purity (a low proportion of tumor cells).

Despite increasing knowledge of the cancer molecular landscape, the clinical and pathological significance of several molecular variants, including SNVs, CNVs and indels, remains unknown and unexplored. As far as variants are concerned and, in particular, when rare or unknown mutations are reported, it is fundamentally important to define the association with the risk of cancer development and progression. In this setting, it is pivotal to predict the structure and the potential functional impact of the proteins generated to. Immunohistochemistry uses tagged antibodies to detect specific proteins - MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 in this instance - in tissue slices or samples. The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends IHC as the first-line test to assess MMR status in sporadic cancer belonging to the spectrum of Lynch syndrome (colorectal, endometrial, small intestine, urothelial, central nervous system and sebaceous gland; Table 3.2). As discussed above, MLH1 mutations are related to loss on IHC of both MLH1 and PMS2; in the same way, mutations in MSH2 relate to the loss of both MSH2 and MSH6 on IHC. Overall, it is necessary to adopt all four IHC antibodies to define MMR status. However, IHC can be affected by several issues - for example, false-negative results may relate to problems with tissue fixation. Where there are fixation issues, it is important to focus on positive internal controls (for example, immune cells). Data interpretation potentially limits the usefulness of TMB analysis, regardless of the approach adopted (WES versus wide gene panels) and gene panel employed. In terms of prediction of suitability for immunotherapeutic regimens, it is important to analyze not only the total number but also the type of the detected mutations. While Rizvi et al. underlined the positive predictive value for immunotherapy when mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and replication are identified, Skoulidis et al. demonstrated that mutations in STK11 (also known as LKB1) were associated with resistance to immunotherapeutic drugs.

9781910797105,ch04,"Studies in twins involve probands with schizophrenia who are either identical (monozygotic: MZ) or non-identical (dizygotic: DZ). MZ twins share 100% of their genes and DZ twins share about 50%. Concordance rates in the two types of twins are compared by looking at the rate at which co-twins also have schizophrenia. The consensus from population-based studies is that concordance rates are about 45% for MZ co-twins and 15% for DZ co-twins. The fact that concordance is less than 100% in MZ twins suggests that non-genetic, environmental factors are also involved. However, the offspring of the unaffected MZ co-twins in discordant pairs are at increased risk of schizophrenia, suggesting that the co-twins still carry a genetic predisposition for the disease. Risk genes for schizophrenia. It is emerging that there are multiple susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. These divide into common genetic variants (SNPs), each of which confers a small (less than twofold) increased risk, and rare variants such as CNVs that can confer increased risk of 20-fold or more.

These divide into common genetic variants (SNPs), each of which confers a small (less than twofold) increased risk, and rare variants such as CNVs that can confer increased risk of 20-fold or more. Of the common variants, the evidence is strongest for the genes for zinc finger protein (ZNF804A; chromosome 2q32), neuregulin (NRG1; 8p12), dysbindin (DTNBP1; 6p22) and DISC1 (1q42) (Table 4.3). The DISC1 linkage followed from the finding of a Scottish pedigree with a balanced 1;11 chromosomal translocation that co-segregated with schizophrenia. The catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene is central to dopamine metabolism and has been studied because it is located close to the VCFS region at 22q11. A missense mutation in the COMT gene gives a valine-to-methionine substitution at codon 158, which produces an unstable enzyme, with reduced breakdown of dopamine. Individuals with this polymorphism have altered activity of the prefrontal cortex during working memory tasks, and in schizophrenia it has been shown to predict the degree of improvement in working memory and negative symptoms in schizophrenia treated with olanzapine. Most of the genes found by genome-wide association studies to be implicated in schizophrenia do seem plausible in that they are known to exert effects on neuronal systems and particularly synaptic function. It appears too that different genes give different symptom profiles; for example, ZNF804A is associated with better cognition, NRG1 with preserved affect and the dysbindin gene (DTNBP1) with IQ. Examples are being uncovered of synergistic gene-gene interactions, and of how specific genes interact with specific environmental risk factors (Table 4.4). Studies looking at patterns of gene expression in the postmortem brain suggest changes in particular functional gene groups in schizophrenia, such as those related to oligodendrocyte and myelin development and synaptic transmission. As genes predisposing to schizophrenia are now being discovered, there is renewed interest in the association between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It has long been known that neither disorder 'breeds true'. The children of mothers with schizophrenia have a sixfold increased risk of bipolar disorder, as well as higher rates of schizophrenia. Estimates suggest that perhaps 60% of the genetic variance for the two disorders is shared. Some genes, such as DISC1 and NRG1, appear to predispose to both disorders and perhaps have their strongest effect in schizoaffective disorders.","Identical twins show a 45% concordance rate. Having a close relative with schizophrenia increases one's own risk 15-fold. Copy number variants are rare major genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

9781910797006,ch03,"The characteristic symptom of COPD is breathlessness on exertion, sometimes accompanied by wheeze and cough, which is often, but not invariably, productive. Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly` causes the patient to seek medical attention, and it is usually the most disabling. Patients often date the onset of their illness from an episode of worsening cough with sputum production, which leaves them with a degree of chronic breathlessness. However, close questioning will often reveal the presence of a 'smoker's cough' over a period of years, along with the production of small amounts (usually < 60 mL/day) of mucoid sputum, usually predominantly in the morning. Most patients (80%) with COPD will have a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years (1 pack-year is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes [1 pack] per day for 1 year or 10 a day for 2 years) before symptoms are recognized, commonly in the fifth decade. However, COPD may occur in the non-smoker and is more frequently missed in this setting. It is characteristic of patients with COPD to progress through the clinical stages of mild, moderate and severe disease. Symptoms and signs therefore vary in any individual depending on the stage of the disease. Considerable loss of lung function can occur before symptoms become apparent, and many patients may seek medical attention when the disease is at an advanced stage, since COPD is a slowly progressive disorder and patients gradually adapt their lives to their disability. Most smokers accept cough and shortness of breath, so they often dismiss these symptoms of progressive airflow limitation as a normal consequence of their smoking habit and the aging process. The characteristic symptom of COPD is breathlessness on exertion, sometimes accompanied by wheeze and cough, which is often, but not invariably, productive. Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly` causes the patient to seek medical attention, and it is usually the most disabling. Patients often date the onset of their illness from an episode of worsening cough with sputum production, which leaves them with a degree of chronic breathlessness. However, close questioning will often reveal the presence of a 'smoker's cough' over a period of years, along with the production of small amounts (usually < 60 mL/day) of mucoid sputum, usually predominantly in the morning. Breathlessness is usually first noted while climbing hills or stairs, carrying heavy loads or hurrying on level ground. The appearance of breathlessness heralds moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. By the time the patient seeks medical advice, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) has usually fallen to around 1-1.5 liters in an average man (30-45% of the expected value). Patients with COPD may adapt their breathing pattern and their behavior to minimize the sensation of breathlessness. Generally, this takes the form of greatly restricted activity. COPD is most common among smokers and after the age of 40. The presence of symptoms or signs in non-smokers or in younger individuals does not exclude COPD, but should raise suspicion of another condition and lead to a review of the other possible diagnoses or increased genetic susceptibility to COPD, such as alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency (see page 28). Importantly, there is, in general, a dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked and the FEV; however, huge individual variations (see Figure 2.1) reflect the varying susceptibility to cigarette smoke. The physical signs seen in patients with COPD are not specific to the disease. They depend on the degree of airflow limitation and pulmonary overinflation, and may be virtually absent in patients with mild-to-moderate disease, so their sensitivity in detecting or excluding COPD is poor. Physical signs of airflow limitation are rarely present until lung function is significantly impaired. Detection of early COPD is possible only by spirometry or by imaging techniques, such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to detect emphysema. Some patients present initially to hospital or to their primary care provider during an exacerbation of the disease and claim that they had no significant symptoms until that time. However, close questioning often reveals the presence of progressive symptoms. Two clinical patterns have been described, both of which represent severe disease - the so-called 'pink puffers' and 'blue bloaters'. The pink and puffing patient is thin and breathless with blood gas values that are preserved until late in the course of the disease, and therefore does not develop pulmonary hypertension until the disease is very advanced. By contrast, the blue and bloated patient develops hypoxemia and hypercapnia earlier, and thus also the complications of edema and secondary polycythemia. These 'phenotypes' are not indicative of emphysema or bronchitis, as was once thought, but clearly indicate the varied systemic manifestations of COPD. These subtypes of COPD, however, only partially capture the heterogeneity of the diseases. Most patients lie between these two extremes, and many patients fit neither pattern. Traditionally, COPD is regarded as a disease of the lungs characterized by progressive symptoms and a decline in lung function. Therapeutic strategies such as bronchodilators and inhaled glucocorticosteroids have therefore been used for relieving symptoms in association with improving airflow limitation. However, COPD is also associated with a number of systemic effects and common comorbidities (see Table 3.3), which may be present at any stage of the disease. Some of these comorbidities arise independent of COPD, whereas others appear to be causally related, either as a result of shared risk factors or the influence of COPD on the development of another condition. Systemic inflammation in COPD may be the link between COPD and some of its comorbidities. Many national and international guidelines for COPD have used a simple classification of disease severity based on spirometry. However, because FEV only partially captures the severity of COPD, recent recommendations suggest assessing additional measures. The most recent classification from the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) takes into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation (Figure 3.2). First, the patient's symptoms are assessed using the COPD assessment test (CAT) or the modified MRC score (mMRC) for dyspnea (see Table 3.2). The CAT is the preferred test as it provides a comprehensive assessment of symptoms (www.catestonline.org). A CAT score of 10 or more indicates a high level of symptoms. Exacerbation risk is then assessed in three ways: by the severity of airflow limitation as indicated by spirometry grade, with a GOLD classification of 3 or 4 indicating high risk (see Table 4.1); by the patient's history of exacerbations, with two or more exacerbations in the preceding year indicating high risk; and by the patient's history of hospitalization in the preceding year. The highest risk parameter should be recorded for the purposes of this assessment. Alternatively, the COPD Foundation Guide recommends assessing seven independent domains of severity (Table 3.4).","Usually (in 80% of patients) there is a significant smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. For those with lesser smoking histories or for younger individuals, consider an alternative diagnosis or a genetic predisposition (exempli gratia alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency). The most common symptom in COPD is breathlessness on exertion. Dyspnea may be discounted by patients until disease is severe, as breathlessness can be avoided by restricting activity. COPD occurs, though less commonly, in those who do not smoke. Physical signs often present only at an advanced stage of the disease. Clinical indicators include signs of overinflation, prominent use of accessory muscles of respiration, weight loss, expiratory wheeze, cyanosis, peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure. These are usually apparent only in severe disease. The systemic effects of COPD result in a number of comorbidities that impact on the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The full spectrum of COPD can now be better identified using new classifications of disease that take into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation."," The characteristic symptom of COPD is breathlessness on exertion, sometimes accompanied by wheeze and cough, which is often, but not invariably, productive. Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly causes the patient to seek medical attention, and it is usually the most disabling. Patients often date the onset of their illness from an episode of worsening cough with sputum production.  The characteristic symptom of COPD is breathlessness on exertion, sometimes accompanied by wheeze and cough. Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly causes the patient to seek medical attention.  The appearance of breathlessness heralds moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. By the time the patient seeks medical advice, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) has usually fallen to around 1-1.5 liters.  COPD is most common among smokers and after the age of 40. There is a dose-response relationship between the number of cigarettes smoked and the FEV.  Physical signs of airflow limitation are rarely present until lung function is significantly impaired. Detection of early COPD is possible only by spirometry or by imaging techniques.  Two clinical patterns have been described, both of which represent severe disease - the 'pink puffers' and 'blue bloaters' These 'phenotypes' are not indicative of emphysema or bronchitis, as was once thought, but clearly indicate the varied systemic manifestations of COPD.  COPD is associated with a number of systemic effects and common comorbidities. Some of these comorbidities arise independent of COPD. Others appear to be causally related, either as a result of shared risk factors or the influence of COPD on the development of another condition. Systemic inflammation in COPD may be the link between COPD and some of its comorbidities.  Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) takes into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation. Exacerbation risk is then assessed in three ways: by the severity of airflow limitation as indicated by spirometry grade.",28.57142857142857,52.02312138728323,36.885245901639344,9.554140127388536,17.441860465116278,12.34567901234568,16.507936507936506,30.057803468208093,21.311475409836063,67.33728647232056,93.5063362121582
9781908541406,ch_6,"Dysfunction of cytosolic enzymes and other platelet constituents. Cyclooxygenase defects result in impaired platelet aggregation and release of ADP from dense granules in response to ADP and collagen, and are associated with a mild bleeding tendency. As acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) inhibits cyclooxygenase and gives rise to similar clinical and laboratory features, cyclooxygenase deficiency is sometimes known as an 'aspirin-like defect'. A variety of other forms of inherited platelet dysfunction have been described; examples are platelet-type von Willebrand disease, collagen receptor deficiency and the Chediak-Higashi and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes. Diagnosis. Inspection of the blood film will reveal whether the platelet count is normal (as in many mild platelet function disorders) or decreased, and if the appearance of the platelets or white cells is abnormal, exempli gratia large platelets and leukocyte Döhle bodies in the May-Hegglin anomaly (see Figure 2.3). Table 4.2 shows how thrombocytopenia due to congenital disorders is differentiated from acquired causes. Acquired disorders. Defective platelet function can be caused by alcohol, drugs, uremia and myeloproliferative disorders. Alcohol alone does not appear to affect platelet function, though it may reduce the platelet count; it does, however, strongly potentiate the inhibitory effects of ASA (aspirin). Antibiotics that inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins, can alter the platelet membrane and prolong the skin bleeding time. Minoxidil inhibits the synthesis of platelet prostaglandins. Valproic acid lowers the platelet count, prolongs the bleeding time and impairs platelet aggregation. The black tree fungus, used in Szechuan cooking, inhibits platelet aggregation. The effects of drugs used therapeutically (exempli gratia ASA [aspirin], clopidogrel) and uremic bleeding are discussed in Chapters 13 and, respectively. Postoperative thrombocytopenias are usually dilutional, because replacement fluids lack platelets, and often resolve within a few days. On the other hand, thrombocytopenias may be persistent in patients who have had cardiac surgery involving the use of aortic balloon pump devices or in patients with leaky heart valves, and may not improve until the pump is removed or the valve repaired. Severe thrombocytopenia may result from the use of platelet glycoprotein inhibitors during coronary angioplasty and stenting. If such features are absent from the history, an immune thrombocytopenia is most likely. Most often this is an autoimmune disorder, such as primary immune thrombocytopenia (formerly called immune or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), but other possibilities such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and post-transfusion purpura should be considered. Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy (see Chapter 10). Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 100-150 x 10 /L) is observed in 6-10% of pregnancies. It is usually a benign incidental finding, but it may be associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a manifestation of primary immune thrombocytopenia or a pseudothrombocytopenia due to platelet clumping in vitro. Pseudothrombocytopenia can be excluded by examining the peripheral smear for platelet clumps. The true platelet count can be assessed by platelet quantitation immediately after the blood is drawn, as the platelets may agglutinate while the blood is standing at room temperature. Occasionally, drawing the blood into citrate anticoagulant, rather than EDTA, will provide a more accurate platelet count. Once it has been established that the patient has a true thrombocytopenia, the benign gestational thrombocytopenias that account for 75% of cases must be differentiated from the uncommon primary immune thrombocytopenia that accounts for 4% of cases (Table 4.6). Platelets may be obtained by plateletpheresis (single-donor platelets) or retrieved from donated whole blood (random-donor platelets). One apheresis unit is equivalent to six random-donor units in terms of platelet numbers. Each random-donor unit generally increases the platelet count by 5 x 10 /L, so that one apheresis unit or six random-donor units should provide a satisfactory increase in platelet count; this must be verified by performing a platelet count 1 hour and 24 hours after the infusion. This will also give some indication of the recovery and survival of the infused platelets. Infusion of platelets can be associated with allergic reactions, which can be minimized by depleting the platelets of accompanying white cells. Transmission of infectious agents may also occur; careful donor assessment and screening for viruses in the donation will substantially reduce this risk. Platelet products must also be screened for bacterial contamination. Platelet sensitization is uncommon, even with random-donor platelets; if platelet alloimmunization develops, platelet cross-matching and giving HLA-matched platelets can be helpful.","Thrombocytopenia may occur with some inherited disorders of platelet function, such as the Bernard-Soulier, gray platelet and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes. Inhibitors of platelet function, such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), should be avoided in individuals with disorders of platelet function and those with thrombocytopenia. Gestational thrombocytopenia is common and requires no treatment, but it must be distinguished from primary immune thrombocytopenia. In immune thrombocytopenia, bleeding is uncommon if the platelet count exceeds 10 x 10 /L and aggressive interventions (exempli gratia high-dose corticosteroids, splenectomy) are not usually indicated. Platelet transfusion has limited indications and should be used sparingly, because it may transmit infection or sensitize the recipient to platelet antigens."," Cyclooxygenase defects result in impaired platelet aggregation and release of ADP from dense granules in response to ADP and collagen.

9781908541277,ch_6,"The diagnosis of epilepsy relies on the correct classification of epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndromes (see Chapter 2), with consequent implications for prognosis and choice of therapy. Epilepsy is not a single disease but an extensive collection of conditions with a wide range of underlying etiologies and pathologies, all sharing the common and fundamental characteristic of recurrent, usually unprovoked, seizures. Figure 3.1 shows some common etiologies in relation to age. Epilepsy is not a single disease but an extensive collection of conditions with a wide range of underlying etiologies and pathologies, all sharing the common and fundamental characteristic of recurrent, usually unprovoked, seizures. Figure 3.1 shows some common etiologies in relation to age. A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures and must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 3.1). For example, syncopal attacks, sometimes with clonic movements and incontinence, are commonly misdiagnosed as epileptic seizures. Furthermore, non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (also called pseudoseizures) are estimated to occur in up to 45% of patients referred to specialist centers with apparently refractory epilepsy. This misidentification of non-epileptic conditions as epilepsy can lead to unnecessary treatments that are potentially harmful, and can delay the start of appropriate therapy. The temptation to attach a label of 'epilepsy' should be resisted if there is any doubt about the diagnosis despite a thorough evaluation. Both the physician and patient must simply await the passage of time before coming to a firm conclusion. Further challenges of diagnosis and management may arise in patients in whom non-epileptic events coexist with epileptic seizures or develop as a substitute for epileptic seizures once the epilepsy is controlled. Electroencephalography can support the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and help with the classification of partial-onset or generalized seizures. It is important to give the electroencephalographer detailed information concerning the patient's age, seizure behavior and response to AEDs. Routine EEGs are often insensitive - more than 50% of patients with epilepsy will have a normal trace. Activation techniques, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation (Figure 3.2),are helpful in uncovering abnormalities. Diagnostic yield can also be increased by repeat recordings. If the initial EEG is unremarkable and the diagnosis remains in doubt, a sleep-deprivation study is recommended. Structural imaging. Imaging studies of the brain to look for underlying structural abnormalities are essential for the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of most patients with epilepsy, particularly those presenting with partial-onset seizures. The imaging modality of choice is MRI. It has higher sensitivity and specificity than CT for identifying structural lesions such as malformations of cortical development (Figure 3.3a), hippocampal sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangioma (Figure 3.3b) and low-grade gliomas (Figure 3.3c).

9781910797815,chp3,"The MPNs vary markedly in morphologic and clinical features (Table 3.1). Thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis are major diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV), respectively. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has a more variable presentation, which may include all the features of PV and ET; however, anemia is a common finding and work-up requires the differential diagnosis of anemia. Furthermore, PMF is generally associated with the most severe symptom burden among the MPNs, although patients with PV or ET often also have significant disease-related symptoms (see Table 3.1). The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for MPNs (Tables 3.2 - 3.4) are based on peripheral blood counts, molecular abnormalities and alterations in bone marrow morphology, reflecting the central role of erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis in the pathophysiology of these conditions. The 2016 updated WHO criteria differ from the 2008 criteria in the following ways. Diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia. Thrombocytosis is a major criterion for the diagnosis of ET (Table 3.2) but can also be present in other MPNs; the diagnostic approach to ET therefore generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. As shown in Figure 3.1, a patient with elevated platelet count (>= 450 x 10 /L) should undergo further blood testing, including a complete blood count, blood film/smear and determination of iron and C-reactive protein status, together with testing for MPN driver mutations and BCR-ABL1. The presence of a driver mutation might suggest a diagnosis of ET but bone marrow biopsy is required to preclude other MPNs such as PV, PMF or myelodysplastic syndrome.

As noted above, the presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include. symptomatic splenomegaly. constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus. Patients with MPNs are at risk of vascular complications such as hemorrhage and venous or arterial thrombosis. Moreover, PV (and ET to a lesser extent) has a risk of progression to secondary myelofibrosis, while PMF may progress to an AML-like blast phase, which may be preceded by a myelodysplastic phase. The extent to which an individual patient is at risk of vascular complications and disease progression is determined by multiple clinical and molecular risk factors (Table 3.5). Since the level of risk influences treatment decisions, risk stratification is essential in the management of MPNs. ET is usually considered to have the best prognosis among the MPNs. Risk stratification focuses on the likelihood of thrombotic complications, and is based on the two main risk factors for thrombosis: age 60 years or older, and a previous thrombotic event.

9781910797310,chp3,"Tumor size (T) is the primary descriptive and most significant prognostic factor for operable lung cancer. Table 3.1 shows the proposed changes to the current T classification. Subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare the survival benefit of sublobar resections (id est wedge resection or segmentectomy) and lobectomy (see pages 24 -). Surgical advances have enabled 'distance from the carina' to be removed from the new TNM classification. However, the poor prognosis associated with pleural invasion has been confirmed, and therefore it remains a contraindication to surgery. Nodal status (N). A fundamental prerequisite in selecting patients for surgical treatment is reliable nodal staging (Table 3.2). The current N classification of nodal staging adequately predicts prognosis, so no change to the N descriptors has been recommended in the eighth edition. Division of the N1 stage into N1a (N1 at a single station) and N1b (N1 at multiple stations), and division of the N2 stage into N2a1 (N2 at a single station without N1 involvement; 'skip' metastasis), N2a2 (N2 at a single station with N1 involvement) and N2b (N2 at multiple stations) is descriptive only, as the survival curves for N1b and N2a2 overlap. Although N2a1 was associated with a better prognosis than N1b, the difference was not significant. Metastasis (M). When patients were assessed according to the number of metastases, there were no significant differences in prognosis in patients with M1a staging (metastases within the chest cavity); however, patients with M1b tumors (distant metastases outside the chest cavity) with a single metastasis in a single organ had a significantly better prognosis than those with multiple metastases in one or several organs. This will now be the definition of M1b and will serve as a first step in providing rational selection criteria for surgical treatment of oligometastatic disease in clinical trials. There will also be a new M1c classification (Table 3.3) - multiple metastases in a single organ or in multiple organs. Ground glass opacity (GGO) is a pulmonary shadow visualized using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), comprised of hazy increased attenuation with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins. Adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of GGO, therefore careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy must be considered when GGO is identified. Patients with multiple tumors and a prominent ground glass component on imaging or lepidic component on microscopy are being seen with increasing frequency. These tumors are associated with good survival after resection and have a lower propensity for nodal and extrathoracic spread than other types of NSCLC; however, they frequently relapse. Sublobar resection with the goal of sparing lung parenchyma is the gold standard for treatment of small GGO. The main difficulty is localizing the tumor within the lung during minimally invasive surgery. Different means of tracking the GGO and guiding the resection have been studied, including ink injection, coil insertion, and indocianide green injection. Most lung cancers are detected at an advanced stage and are treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgical resection has proved valuable in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC without nodal involvement or distant metastasis, resulting in long-term survival with a lower risk of postoperative mortality. Surgery also has a relevant role in the treatment of locally advanced tumors invading neighboring structures.","Better subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare wedge resection and segmentectomy.

9781910797426,ch12,"Etiology and pathogenesis. Cancers of the ampulla of Vater, the intrapancreatic bile duct and duodenum are all adenocarcinomas and often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer. Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors. All of these tumors progress from a small benign adenoma through to invasive adenocarcinoma, although most are only detected at the cancerous stage. Ampullary tumors arise from the common channel of the ampulla of Vater as benign adenomas and progress as tubulovillous adenomas before becoming adenocarcinomas. Two pathological types of ampullary cancer have been described (intestinal versus pancreaticobiliary), with important consequences for patients' prognosis. Duodenal tumors also commence as adenomas before progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma. The long-term survival of patients with these cancers is better than that for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Figure 12.1). Ampullary tumors tend to be slow growing, so endoscopic stenting can provide good medium-to-long-term palliation in advanced patients.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) arise from cells in the islet of Langerhans or enterochromaffin-like cells. In contrast to most other tumors of the pancreas, these tumors tend to be highly vascular, a feature that is important in making a radiological diagnosis. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

In contrast to most other tumors of the pancreas, these tumors tend to be highly vascular, a feature that is important in making a radiological diagnosis. Management. Patients with pNETs need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes specialist endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists and pancreatic surgeons. Medical treatment. The syndromes associated with all of these tumors, except for insulinoma, can be managed medically during the wait for surgery or, if there is metastatic disease, with a long-acting somatostatin receptor antagonist (octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide slow release). Although antitumor efficacy of somatostatin analogs is rather weak, there is disease stabilization in more than 50% of patients. Surgical tumor debulking is commonly undertaken, since the symptoms may still be difficult to control with somatostatin receptor antagonists. Cystic pancreatic tumors. Cystic neoplasms need to be distinguished from pseudocysts secondary to acute or chronic pancreatitis. These tumors include serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and other rare cystic lesions (cystic neuroendocrine tumors, etc.). Diagnosis is made by CT (Figure 12.4) or MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography sequences (Figure 12.5), usually followed by EUS-guided FNA and analysis of the cystic fluid (Figure 12.6). Pancreatic lymphoma. By definition pancreatic lymphoma is restricted to the pancreas and draining lymph nodes. Resection should be undertaken where possible. If this is not feasible chemotherapy should be tried, although pancreatic lymphomas respond poorly. Metastases to the pancreas. The pancreas is a site for the spread of metastases from cancers originating in the abdomen, breast, bronchus or skin (melanoma). Sometimes these metastases are isolated, in which case radical resection is the treatment of choice.","Tumor types that occur in the ampullary and periampullary regions may have a much better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with inherited neuroendocrine tumors require genetic counseling and long-term follow-up for pancreatic and other tumor types. Neuroendocrine tumors should usually be removed surgically. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Cystic pancreatic tumors need to be differentiated from pancreatic pseudocysts, but only a minority need resection at the time of diagnosis. Solitary metastases to the pancreas may be worth resecting."," Cancers of the ampulla of Vater, the intrapancreatic bile duct and duodenum are all adenocarcinomas. Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors.

9781908541024,ch_13,"Although half of all primary and metastatic brain tumors occur in patients over the age of 65 (Figure 12.1), geriatric neuro-oncology is an area that has received limited attention. Population studies suggest that increasing age is often associated with decreasing treatment. While this may be appropriate for some elderly patients, other patients over the age of 65 remain in excellent health with a good quality of life and the potential to respond to appropriate treatment. The area deserves particular attention as the elderly represent the fastest growing segment of the population. Many intracranial tumors present with subacute cognitive decline over several weeks to months. In an elderly patient the differential diagnosis for this clinical presentation is lengthy, ranging from dementia and depression to cerebrovascular disease. Employing excellent neuroimaging early in the diagnostic evaluation usually allows diagnosis of an intracranial mass lesion. As each tumor requires a specific approach to management it is critical to obtain tissue for a pathological diagnosis to avoid administering incorrect and toxic therapies. Recent advances in the management of brain tumors raise a number of issues for older patients. First, older patients are often underrepresented in those clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of a new therapy and thus it is not known if the same benefit can be expected in the geriatric population. Further, the acute toxicity profile associated with a new therapy may be different in the elderly.

9781910797617,chp6,"The expanded genetic characterization of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis is a critical advance in the last 5 years and is influencing both treatment and patient selection for standard therapy and clinical trials in AML. While the karyotype remains key in prognostication, molecular profiling represents a paradigm shift for both research and the clinical management of AML. Molecular testing is destined to become an essential part of the initial characterization of patients with AML. Drugs in late-stage development. As described in Chapter 3, four new treatments for AML were recently approved, three of which are molecularly targeted products, marking a turning point in the treatment of AML. Several targeted agents are currently in the late stages of clinical development, as described below, and many more approaches are being explored (see Table 6.1). Many of these products in development have been awarded breakthrough status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recognizing the lack of effective treatments for patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and those with relapsed or refractory disease, for whom the prognosis is poor. FLT3 inhibitors. In addition to midostaurin, several other FLT3 inhibitors are currently in trials. Crenolanib inhibits FLT3 internal tandem repeat (FLT3 -ITD) and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3 -TKD) mutations in the active conformation but has little activity against cKIT; this is expected to avoid the myelosuppression seen with other FLT3 inhibitors that have been shown to inhibit KIT. The addition of crenolanib to standard 3 + 7 induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML resulted in 88% complete response rate (CR), with no unexpected toxicities. Quizartinib (AC220). A non-randomized Phase II study reported a remission rate of 44% and median overall survival (OS) of 23 weeks in patients with FLT3 -ITD-mutated AML that had relapsed or was refractory to second-line treatment or relapsed following HCT in a non-randomized Phase II study. Quizartinib is being investigated across multiple lines of treatment, including induction and consolidation chemotherapy, as a maintenance therapy for patients in first remission after chemotherapy, and for salvage therapy. Nevertheless, studies of cellular therapies, including CAR-T and natural killer (NK) cells, and antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 and other markers, are of interest. New approaches to treatment include antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and novel antibody-based approaches using bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) and dual-affinity re-targeting (DART) molecules, which bind to CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts, thereby directing activated immune cells to malignant cells. Studies with cellular therapies and other antibody-based therapies are of great interest and promise in AML, including with CAR-T or NK cells, and likewise with antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 or other markers of interest. Included among these are new ADCs and novel antibody-based approaches using BiTEs or DARTs designed to direct activated immune cells to malignant cells (id est dual affinity for CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts). A new era for clinical trials in AML?. Recent experience with enasidenib, approved on the basis of data from patients specifically with IDH2 mutations, challenges the dogma that large randomized controlled trials showing survival benefit in a general AML population are required for approval. The approval of enasidenib was based on data from a single-arm phase 1/2 monotherapy trial involving only 199 patients; historical data were used for the control. This approval reflects the regulatory agencies' recognition of the challenges of evaluating new treatments in relatively rare subtypes of a disease; similar approvals have been seen across a range of oncology (hematologic and solid tumors) in recent years. Trials of new targeted agents are also likely to be in small, clearly identified patient populations. Beat AML is a new approach to clinical trials, begun in late 2016 and sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The aim is to quickly and comprehensively genetically characterize older patients (> 60 years) with previously untreated AML and to treat with novel targeted therapy on the basis of the genetic result. Within a week of diagnosis, patients will be assigned to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations (Table 6.2). Each group is treated with unique therapy designed for that molecular aberration. Patients who have more favorable clinical outcomes with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with core binding factor rearrangements or an NPM1 mutation without an FLT3 mutation) are assigned 3 + 7-based treatment in combination with an investigational agent. Patients with poor long-term outcomes and lower remission rates with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with a p53 mutation) receive less intensive therapy. Two examples of treatments in these poor-risk subsets are hypomethylating agent in combination with novel therapy, and monotherapy with an investigational agent followed by lower-intensity treatment (if no response is observed during the monotherapy window). Hopefully, such an approach will quickly identify promising agents and speed up drug approvals in AML. Subsequent iterations of the trial (exempli gratia 'version 2.0' and beyond) will include agents for other targets and possibly combinations of novel drugs.

Of critical importance to the Beat AML trial, as well as for trials of treatments, is the need to achieve disease control in order to facilitate the opportunity for alloHCT for eligible patients. Even in the era of molecular targeted treatment, alloHCT remains the best tool available for the prevention of relapse.","A wide range of targeted agencies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently in the late stages of development, including FLT3 inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, giltertinib, sorafenib), hypomethylating agents (guadecitabine, oral azacitidine), the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat, the blc-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the E-selectin inhibitor GM-1271.

Increased sebum production. Acne is a hormonally mediated disease, with androgens contributing to an increase in sebum production from sebaceous glands. Increased sebum production, which presents as seborrhea, correlates well with acne severity. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is thought to be the main androgen responsible for sebum production, although a possible direct role of testosterone has not been excluded. However, only a minority of patients with acne have elevated serum androgen levels, and irregular menses or hirsutism has been reported only infrequently in women with acne.

9781910797471,ch05,"A 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and renal impairment is referred to the cardiology outpatient department because of fatigue. He is overweight and relatively inactive, but still able to visit his country property and went hunting as recently as last year. He has experienced shortness of breath when climbing two flights of stairs at home and has difficulty in walking uphill to his house. He has no history of ischemic heart disease or other cardiac symptoms. His blood pressure is 164/96 mmHg and he has an irregular pulse of 102 beats per minute. He has no jugular venous distension or edema, and his chest is clear to auscultation; the apex beat is impalpable but there is a blowing pansystolic murmur at the apex. The chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and the ECG shows atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block. This is a typical presentation of decompensating chronic heart failure (HF). The following questions need to be asked. The onset of HF symptoms (Table 5.2) may be acute (typically with pulmonary edema, even with cardiogenic shock) or subacute. Both right and left HF may occur in the context of low output (fatigue, syncope and hypotension), and both right- and left-sided HF usually occur together. Assessment of functional class (see Table 2.1), based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic HF because it is linked to outcome - the annualized mortality in NYHA class IV HF is about 50%, which is four to five times that of class II and twice that of class III. The signs of HF are often subtle. Jugular venous pressure is a sign of intravascular volume overload that is often overlooked (25-58% of cases) (Table 5.3). The Framingham criteria for HF are shown in Table 5.4. However, these features are ill-suited to the recognition of HF with preserved ejection fraction, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has proposed the incorporation of imaging findings in order to facilitate the recognition of HF in patients presenting with exercise intolerance alone (see Table 5.4). The initial clinical picture of acute HF reflects the varying degree of impairment of cardiac output and elevation in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (obtained at left and right heart catheterization, respectively). Patients with acute HF can present with one of several distinct hemodynamic profiles, based on the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold) (Figure 5.3). More specific for acute HF is Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention. Arrhythmias may play a part in both acute and chronic HF. Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement. Atrial arrhythmias contribute to reduced functional capacity, as atrial systole makes an important contribution to stroke volume, especially in the context of LV filling problems and particularly with exercise. Although some patients die from progressive HF, ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF. The risk of fatal arrhythmias is greatest in the presence of low ejection fraction, but because of the higher number of patients with less severe reduction of ejection fraction, this group has the highest absolute number of sudden deaths.

Imaging for coronary disease and viable myocardium. The role of CAD should be considered in any patient with HF. Coronary investigation is often not indicated in young patients for whom there is a good alternative explanation for their symptoms; however, most patients with HF are elderly and in these patients coronary angiography may be considered if it is felt that the patient is a suitable candidate for a revascularization procedure. Coronary CT has been used in these circumstances, although calcification, which may preclude recognition of stenosis, should be expected in older patients. Once coronary disease has been identified, the next question is whether this is an 'innocent bystander'. A variety of tests have been reported for the detection of viable myocardium, ranging from the simple (single-photon-emission CT, dobutamine echo) to the complex (MRI, positron emission tomography). Although the STICH trial found no relationship between the results of viability imaging and outcome, it is important to consider not only the presence of dysfunctional but viable tissue, but also its extent, id est the total burden of compromised myocardium, including ischemia.

Functional testing involves exercise testing using either a treadmill or ergometer, with or without analysis of expired gases to obtain peak oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide generation.

Studies have shown a strong association between dopamine D receptor occupancy, antipsychotic dose, symptom remission and adverse effects. Finally, multiple studies have demonstrated that dopamine plays a central role in reward mechanisms, especially the mesolimbic projection to the nucleus accumbens. People with schizophrenia exhibit several impairments that are consistent with altered reward system function, including anhedonia, decreased motivation and failure to use feedback to enhance goal-directed behavior. Although the dopamine hypothesis remains central, it has been found that a substantial proportion of people with schizophrenia do not adequately respond to dopamine antagonists. This suggests that other neurotransmitters are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The glutamate hypothesis. Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and plays a central role in cortical-subcortical and thalamic-cortical excitatory projections. It acts at ionotropic receptors, which mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission, and at metabotropic receptors, which activate second messenger systems through the G-protein system and regulate the release of glutamate and other neurotransmitters (Table 8.2). gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are extensively located on cerebral cortical interneurons and regulate cortical glutamatergic efferents. GABA receptors are also important in processing thalamic inputs to the cerebral cortex. GABA interneurons may be decreased in people with schizophrenia, with a possible selective decrease in GABA A receptors. Decreased GABAergic function may contribute to altered cortical function and the broad array of observed cognitive impairments.",Positive symptoms are hypothesized to be due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Negative symptoms are hypothesized to be due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway. Disturbances in the cholinergic and GABAergic systems have been hypothesized to underlie cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis remains the major neurochemical hypothesis of schizophrenia. Altered glutamate activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of negative and positive symptoms and cognitive impairments.," The dopamine hypothesis was reformulated to predict the existence of hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic activity in people with schizophrenia. The reformulation states that positive symptoms are due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Negative symptoms are due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway.

9781912776207,ch4,"Accurate diagnosis and subtyping of PTCL is challenging but crucial, because it determines both prognosis and choice of therapy. The neoplastic nature of a given T-cell population is informed by its morphology, aberrant T-cell phenotype and clonality based on T-cell receptor (TCR) genotype (id est alphabeta versus gammaδ; see page 11). Accumulating evidence indicates that TCR genotype and the cell of origin influence tumor biology and clinical behavior, and are becoming increasingly clinically relevant as targeted therapeutic options emerge. Distinction between the PTCL subtypes requires consideration of the clinical picture, morphology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cytogenetics and molecular biology. Total body imaging is required for accurate staging. Imaging at diagnosis should include cross-sectional imaging of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis, conventionally by contrast-enhanced CT, but increasingly using functional fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT. PET-CT is particularly useful for imaging extranodal PTCL and types of T-cell lymphoma presenting in the skin, and is recommended at staging and restaging; however, residual FDG-avid lesions lack specificity, and biopsy confirmation is recommended.

9781910797495,chp12,"Acute headache. The immediate, important first step in assessing a new headache is determining whether the headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical event requiring emergency evaluation and management. All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and discarded before considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition. Brain imaging, including neurovascular studies, may be needed as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurement and analysis and further evaluation by a neurologist. For intractable migraine and occipital neuralgia, non-invasive methods of vagal neurostimulation and transcranial magnetic neurostimulation may serve as useful adjuncts to more conventional therapies. Trials of more invasive forms of neuromodulation in the form of temporary insertion of suboccipital electrodes result in about 50% of these patients proceeding to permanent implantation of electrodes with a pulse generator. Tension headache. Management of episodic tension-type headaches starts with understanding the precipitants of the headaches. This is best accomplished by a headache diary in which the patient records all headaches and their contexts, either in a small notebook, on headache diary sheets or in a personal digital assistant (PDA). Once precipitants are identified, intervention strategies should proceed as follows. For stress-induced headache, a stress management program, usually delivered in CBT, that trains the patient to avoid and/or manage precipitating stressors and to relax and stretch at onset of headache. For positional headache, such as that activated by poor ergonomics at a computer terminal, positional and seating changes, stretching routines and icing can be helpful. At the onset of headache, modulation techniques are initiated, such as stretching and icing, and relaxation techniques. Usually analgesics such as NSAIDs or paracetamol suffice, although other medications such as tramadol may be tried in more severe forms. The medical custom in some countries, such as the USA, includes use of pills, combining a barbiturate, butalbital, and caffeine with paracetamol or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; aspirin). Regular and frequent use (more than two to three times weekly) of these and other short-acting sedatives and anxiolytics as well as opioids should be avoided because of the potential for developing transform (rebound) headache, medication dependency or even addiction. Occipital neuralgia. Pressure over occipital nerves or nerve injury due to trauma or surgery may activate headache symptoms. Nerve block may eliminate headache symptoms temporarily or for extended periods. Such blocks do not accurately predict the outcome of trial suboccipital nerve stimulation (see above). Myofascial headache. Treatment includes awareness and avoidance of triggers, such as posture and stress. Analgesics are used with usual cautions. Trigger point injections may give short-term benefit, and physical therapy may be helpful.","In patients without history of chronic headaches, determine whether an acute new headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition. In chronic headache:- use a headache diary to differentiate headache type and establish pattern of triggers to enable self-management strategies- institute preventive measures such as trigger avoidance, stress control and medication- institute abortive regimen appropriate for headache type- migraine: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress control, triptans- tension/myofascial: NSAIDs, stress control, icing, stretching- avoid regular frequent analgesic use to reduce incidence of transform (rebound) headache physical dependency."," All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and discarded before considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition.

Around 20-40% of patients present with seizures, which are most commonly associated with tumors of the temporal lobe. Up to 50% of patients have seizures later in the disease course. These may be simple partial seizures, where the electrical disturbance is limited to a specific area of one cerebral hemisphere and consciousness is retained, or complex partial seizures, in which consciousness is impaired or lost. Partial seizures may spread to cause a generalized seizure, classified as partial seizures secondarily generalized.

9781910797815,chp2,"The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are rare disorders associated with significant morbidity and, to varying extents, decreased life expectancy. Population-based epidemiology data are heterogeneous, possibly reflecting the changing classification of the disorders over time, misdiagnoses and problems with case ascertainment.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are the most common MPNs and, together with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), account for about one-third of all newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies. The incidence and prevalence of these MPNs has been investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 34 studies conducted worldwide. The crude annual incidence for the MPNs combined was 2.58 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval 1.90-3.50), with individual studies yielding rates of 1.15-4.99 per 100 000 (Table 2.1).

In general, patients with ET or PV have a near-normal life expectancy with current treatment strategies, whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. The UK HMRN has reported 3-year relative survival rates of more than 90% in patients with the chronic MPNs (ET, PV, MPN, unclassifiable) compared with fewer than 70% in those with myelofibrosis (Figure 2.1). However, the emergence of new and improved treatments in recent years has markedly improved survival rates. For example, the introduction of phlebotomy as a routine treatment for PV increased median survival from less than 2 years to approximately 14 years. Genetic predisposition. In addition to the presence of the driver mutations described in Chapter 1, age is a predominant risk factor for the MPNs. In the UK HMRN study, the median age at diagnosis in people with chronic MPNs was 70-74 years (Table 2.4). PV tended to be diagnosed at an earlier age in men than in women. An estimated 7-8% of individuals with apparently sporadic MPN have a family history with at least two cases of MPN, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Such familial cases are presumed to be due to acquisition of the somatic driver mutation through a genetic predisposition. To date, familial MPN has been identified in only a small number of families; however, identification of such cases may facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate intervention. Other risk factors for the MPNs have been proposed (Table 2.5), although in many cases the supporting evidence is limited. Two major long-term epidemiology studies have reported strong evidence that increased body mass index and smoking have significant associations with some or all of the MPNs.","The incidence of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is approximately 2.6 per 100 000.

Recent data from the UK suggest that the incidence of ET and PV is similar in men and women, whereas PMF is twice as common in men. ET and PV are associated with near-normal life expectancy whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. MPNs primarily affect older individuals: the median age at diagnosis is 70-74 years.

In advanced disease, the aim is to achieve maximal cytoreduction and tumor reduction. Surgery for primary ovarian cancer. Surgical management of primary ovarian cancer may involve non-fertility-sparing and fertility-sparing approaches (Figure 5.1). Non-fertility-sparing surgery consists of cytological staging, removal of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and uterus, peritoneal biopsies and lymph node dissection (Table 5.1). In addition, appendicectomy should be considered in patients with mucinous histology, or if the appendix appears abnormal. Depending on the histological grade and tumor subtype, up to 30% of patients with apparently early epithelial ovarian cancer will be upstaged after comprehensive peritoneal and lymph node staging. - The only prospective randomized trial to have compared lymph node sampling alone with systematic lymph node dissection found that 13% of patients with lymph node involvement would be missed with lymph node sampling alone; this clearly has important implications for tumor staging and choice of adjuvant treatment. However, in this study, systematic lymph node dissection was not associated with a significant survival benefit compared with sampling alone, partly because of a lack of statistical power but also because of common use of chemotherapy in the sampling arm, which seemed to potentially compensate for the less radical dissection. Increasing evidence shows that the prevalence of positive lymph nodes in stage IA mucinous cancer is extremely low, and that there is no value in performing surgery that can lead to unnecessary morbidity. Patients with stage IA ovarian cancer and favorable histology (low-grade mucinous, serous, endometrioid or mixed histology) have been shown to have a lower risk after fertility-preserving surgery than patients with a higher disease stage or tumor grade. In large retrospective analyses, women with grade 3 disease or stage IC3 with clear cell histology had a higher risk of recurrence (Figure 5.2), which was mainly related to the higher incidence of extra-ovarian spread in grade 3 tumors rather than to a higher relapse rate in the preserved ovary. In retrospective studies, the risk of positive contralateral pelvic lymph nodes in women with unilateral disease despite negative ipsilateral nodes was as high as 11%., For this reason, staging of pelvic lymph nodes should be bilateral. In order to achieve total macroscopic tumor clearance in peritoneally disseminated disease, a maximal surgical effort is required, incorporating multivisceral resection techniques such as. extensive peritoneal stripping. full thickness diaphragmatic resection. removal of bulky pelvic/para-aortic lymph nodes.","Surgery is one of the cornerstones of treatment for ovarian cancer. The key aims of surgery are tumor removal and accurate staging. Surgery for relapsed disease is associated with significant prolongation of progression-free survival in prospective studies; data for overall survival are not yet mature, but in retrospective series patients who are tumor free after surgery at relapse have significantly longer overall survival than those with residual tumor. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is associated with lower complete debulking rates at relapse, but not with inferior overall survival in tumor-free patients who undergo surgery. Multivisceral surgery is needed to achieve complete tumor resection."," Surgery is the cornerstone of management for both early and advanced ovarian cancer.

9781910797617,chp1,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that affects the blood and bone marrow. The build up of abnormal white blood cells interferes with the production of red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells, and indirectly leads to leukemic complications of infection, fatigue and hemorrhage. Complications also arise directly from the proliferation and accumulation of immature leukemia cells, which can affect blood flow or infiltrate other organs. The pathogenesis is described in more detail on page 9. Incidence data specific for AML worldwide are limited, as AML is usually included within the broader category of leukemia in epidemiology registries such as GLOBOCAN. The incidence of AML in the USA is 4.2 per 100 000 per year, with an estimated 21 380 new cases in 2017. AML accounts for about 1.3% of all new cancer cases and 31% of all new leukemia cases. In the UK in 2014, there were 3072 new cases of AML (fewer than 1% of all new cancer cases); there the incidence has risen by 28% since the early 1990s. Annual incidence rates differ little between large datasets from the USA (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results), the UK (Cancer Research UK), and Sweden (Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry). Data from developing countries are sparse. AML is rare compared with other cancers, but is the most common acute leukemia in adults. Age, sex and ethnicity. While AML affects all age groups, the incidence increases with advancing age (Figure 1.1), presenting at a median age of 67-69 years. AML is slightly more common in men than women, particularly in the older age groups. It is more commonly diagnosed in developed countries and is more common in white than in other populations. Survival. AML is universally fatal if untreated. Even with treatment, patients seldom survive long term: according to US registry data, only 27% of patients survive 5 years from diagnosis. Survival is particularly poor in older patients, with fewer than 10% surviving 5 years. This is attributed to a marked increase in intrinsic chemoresistance with age and a greater number of comorbidities that compromise tolerance to chemotherapy. Some older patients do not receive treatment for AML because of these concerns, although data from the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry demonstrate that this population benefits from treatment instead of purely palliative care., Figure 1.2 shows overall survival estimates by age group for patients in the Swedish registry.

Sequencing data demonstrate the surprising finding that AML is associated with far fewer mutations than most other adult cancers: adults with AML have an average of 13 genetic mutations, in stark contrast to melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer, which typically have several hundred, as illustrated in Figure 1.4. TCGA has also shown that, on average, only five of 13 mutations found in a typical patient with AML are in genes known to be frequently mutated in AML. Despite the relatively low number of known mutations, there is tremendous heterogeneity in the types of mutation found in patients with AML. Furthermore, genetic analysis of serial samples from patients suggests that the pathogenesis of the disease is (at least in most cases) not rooted in a single mutation but in complex relationships between the accumulated (but limited number of) mutations. Most cases of AML are idiopathic, arising in previously healthy individuals with no (or unknown) genetic predisposition. Advancing age is the main risk factor for AML, as noted above and described by TCGA, but a number of other risk factors contribute to the development of AML in some patients. These include familial risk, environmental exposure to chemicals, drugs or ionizing radiation, and antecedent hematologic disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Familial risk. Although most cases of AML are not familial, it is now clear that myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition (exempli gratia an inherited risk) are more frequent than has been recognized previously. Myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition - that is, AML and related disorders that arise in the setting of an inherited genetic mutation which puts the patient at increased risk for developing the disease - are an important component of the forthcoming revision to the World Health Organization classification of AML (see Table 2.3). Germline mutations associated with an increased risk of developing a myeloid neoplasm occur in the CEBPA, DDX41, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6 and GATA2 genes, among others. Familial risk.

Patients typically require transfusion support and are at risk for potentially fatal infection. AML is uniformly fatal without treatment. AML is the most common acute leukemia in older adults, with median age at diagnosis of 67-69 years. Long-term survival of patients with AML is poor: about a quarter of patients survive 5 years but only 10% of older patients. Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time. Most cases of AML are idiopathic; however, prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents increases the risk of AML.

9781908541963,chapter3,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In the USA, approximately 2 million people suffer from an alcohol-induced liver disorder. In the UK in 2012, ALD accounted for 63% (4425) of all alcohol-related deaths, an 18% increase on 2002. Medical costs associated with caring for these patients are enormous. Liver function tests. Examination of laboratory results is helpful in diagnosing ALD. The aminotransferases are elevated and have a characteristic pattern in patients with ALD: the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is almost always higher than the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and the greater the ratio the more likely that the liver disease is due to alcohol. Alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin levels may be increased, the prothrombin time (PT) prolonged and the albumin level depressed. The last two are good markers of the severity of ALD. However, it should also be noted that liver function tests may be entirely normal in the presence of cirrhosis, particularly if the patient has achieved sobriety. The treatment of ALD essentially entails abstinence from alcohol, which is clearly the most important factor in promoting both short- and long-term survival. Achieving abstinence typically requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous, professional alcoholism counselors and, often, mental health professionals. This requires a substantial commitment on the part of the patient and the patient's family. Ideally, the patient will be encouraged by the knowledge that, with cessation of alcohol intake, their liver function is likely to improve substantially. Nutrition. Alcoholics are usually malnourished, and improving nutrition is associated with improved outcomes. This is particularly important for patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Anorexia may prevent adequate nutrition and feeding via an enteral tube is sometimes required. Most alcoholics need protein. Unfortunately, however, a few patients with advanced liver disease develop hepatic encephalopathy when given large amounts of protein. Consultation with dietitians may be beneficial. Corticosteroids. Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammatory condition. Thus, corticosteroids are a logical treatment for ALD. However, despite many studies that have investigated the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, there is no clear consensus on their efficacy. Most hepatologists believe that patients with the most severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis - id est those with a Maddrey's discriminant function (DF) score greater than 32 - will benefit from a course of corticosteroids. The DF score is calculated with the simple formula.","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease. Patients with ALD typically have mild to moderate elevations in aminotransferases, with AST > ALT. Early intervention prevents permanent injury, but interrupting alcoholism can be difficult.

9781908541796,chapter1,"Lymphoma is a malignancy of lymphocytes and their progenitors. The term lymphoma encompasses a broad range of lymphoid malignancies, which is reflected in the complexity of the classification systems (see Appendix, page 131). Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is clinically useful, it is now recognized that many of the broader categories, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, include several distinct entities, each of which may have its own unique epidemiological and etiologic profile. Consequently, it is difficult to present an all-encompassing overview of the epidemiology of lymphoma. Incidence and relevant factors. In the USA, Europe and Australasia the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is approximately 20 per 100 000 of the population, with a slightly higher incidence in men than in women. This makes lymphoma the sixth or seventh most common cancer worldwide. Changes in incidence. Between 1973 and 1990, the annual incidence of NHL in the USA rose by 81% from 10.2 to 18.5/100 0000 (Figure 1.2); this increase was observed in all racial groups and in both sexes. This rate of increase has only been surpassed by lung cancer in women and melanoma in both sexes for which specific etiologic factors have been identified (smoking and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, respectively). Recent age-adjusted data in the USA (and UK) suggest, however, that since 1990 the incidence of NHL has plateaued. Interestingly, the incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma has also been stable. Common risk factors with low relative risk. Many environmental factors have been implicated in the development of lymphoma (see below). Most of these have been identified using case-control retrospective analyses, which have disadvantages, such as recall and selection bias, that can reduce the validity of the results. Further large prospective cohort studies are needed, some of which are ongoing. However, it must be remembered that a relatively innocuous environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk of developing lymphoma can contribute substantially to a rising incidence if a sufficiently large number of people are exposed. Nevertheless, it is not possible to test for every environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk. Patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs following solid organ transplantation are at 30-50-fold increased risk of developing NHL; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is often a cofactor. The drugs impair T-cell control of EBV-driven polyclonal B-cell activation, resulting in polyclonal B-cell proliferation. A dominant B-cell clone can then evolve, resulting in lymphoma (see Chapter 8). Infection (other than HIV) may be an acquired cause of lymphoma (Tables 1.2 and 1.3). Inflammatory conditions. Certain inflammatory conditions predispose to the development of NHL and particularly extranodal marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, which are associated with organ-specific autoimmune conditions. For example, Sjögren syndrome (an autoimmune condition affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands) is associated with a 15-fold increased risk of developing salivary or lacrimal MALT lymphomas, and Hashimoto disease (an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid gland) predisposes to thyroid MALT lymphoma. Pesticide/herbicide exposure has been implicated in the etiology of NHL in numerous studies. Agents include organophosphates, phenoxyacetic acid herbicides and triazine herbicides. However, the results are inconsistent with wide variations in the estimates of risk. Presumably this is because most investigations have been case-control studies in which the estimation of risk is fraught with difficulty. Some studies have also demonstrated an association between specific pesticides and herbicides and NHL subtypes but, again, the results are inconsistent. Pesticide exposure is not only relevant to the small proportion of the population who work in agriculture, as studies have convincingly shown that pesticide exposure in the general population is increasing dramatically. Only a small (and therefore difficult to demonstrate) relative risk may account for a significant proportion of lymphoma cases. Blood transfusion. Increased use of blood transfusions has coincided with the increased incidence of lymphoma. It has been postulated that the immunosuppressive action of a blood transfusion and/or the inherent risk of spreading bloodborne viruses is involved. However, results from cohort and case-control studies are conflicting.","The epidemiology of lymphoma is difficult to study owing to the existence of so many different subtypes of the disease, each with its own epidemiology and associated causative factors. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s but has plateaued in recent years. Large cohort studies are required to verify many of the potential causative factors. Various other subtypes of lymphoma have been linked with infection, particularly immunosuppression-related lymphomas caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas caused by various bacterial infections. An understanding of the epidemiology has, in some instances, led to an understanding of causative factors such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma."," Lymphoma is a malignancy of lymphocytes and their progenitors.

The indications for transplantation are liver failure, defined by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) as a disease severity score ranging from 4 to 40, typically above 20; severe and intractable pruritus; and hepatocellular carcinoma The results of liver transplantation for PBC are excellent. There is evidence that PBC recurs in the transplanted liver, but this phenomenon appears to be of little clinical relevance in the first 10-15 years after transplantation. A rapid deterioration may indicate the development of a complicating cholangiocarcinoma. The risk of this malignant transformation is about 6-15% over the course of the disease. Screening for malignant transformation is not effective in detecting early disease, and progression to cholangiocarcinoma is generally regarded as a contraindication to liver transplantation. Treatment. UDCA, 10-15 mg/kg/day, is recommended. This ameliorates pruritus, improves the liver biochemistry and histology and may alter the natural history of the disease. Immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies have not proved effective. Liver transplantation is used widely for advanced disease. The indications for transplantation are less precise than they are in PBC, but persistent jaundice of more than 3 months' duration, in addition to evidence of liver failure or severe portal hypertension, are reasonable indications to proceed to liver transplantation. The results of liver transplantation are excellent in the absence of cholangiocarcinoma. PSC recurs in 8-15% of cases and is occasionally a cause of significant graft dysfunction.","Autoimmune liver disease can target the hepatocyte or any element of the bile duct system.

9781910797907,chp2,"Despite being the best studied of the glycolytic enzyme disorders, gaps remain in our understanding of pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. More than 600 cases of PK deficiency have been reported, mainly from Europe, the USA and Japan, but the disease occurs worldwide, and it is likely that many cases go unreported. This may be because affected individuals die before birth, or because cases are mild and do not require medical attention. Alternatively, some cases may not be properly recognized, or they may be misdiagnosed. Given that some cases may not present with any of the findings usually associated with the condition, there are likely to be more cases of PK deficiency than are published in the literature. Patient registries have now been developed for PK deficiency, which are helping to characterize the range of symptoms and complications arising from this disorder. As discussed in Chapter 1, mutations in the PKLR gene on chromosome 1 are responsible for PK deficiency. More than 300 different mutations have been reported; most are very rare, occurring only once. Currently, about 25% of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency appear to have a previously unrecorded mutation. Although many of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are rare, a few are recorded more frequently (Table 2.1). The variability in how PK deficiency manifests is thought to reflect the heterogeneity of these causative mutations, as well as the fact that most individuals with PK deficiency will be compound heterozygotes (id est they will have a different mutation in each copy of the PKLR gene). Approximately 70% of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense (M) mutations (id est a single nucleotide change resulting in the production of a different amino acid), while the others are more disruptive non-missense (NM) mutations - either nonsense or insertional mutations, deletions (such as the deletion of exon 11 found in the Romany population), or splicing abnormalities (see pages 43 -). Genotype-phenotype relationship. Current research is focusing on the relationship between specific mutations in the PKLR gene and the severity of hemolysis. Given the sheer number of different mutations and the predominance of compound heterozygotes, studies of the relationship between genotype and phenotype have grouped patients by type of mutation (id est two missense mutations [M/M], one missense and one non-missense mutation [M/NM], or two non-missense mutations [NM/NM]). Findings so far suggest that individuals with more disruptive (non-missense) mutations are more severely affected; they have lower levels of hemoglobin and require more frequent transfusions and a greater total transfusion volume. They also have a higher rate of splenectomy and a higher frequency of iron overload (see pages 43 -). While almost all cases of PK deficiency are inherited and result from mutations in the PKLR gene, an acquired form of the deficiency can very rarely occur secondarily to other blood diseases, such as acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory sideroblastic anemia.

9781908541666,ch_13,"Diabetic pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome for the fetus, but there is little excess mortality among diabetic women. Pregnancy may be complicated by type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and, increasingly, by type 2 diabetes. Occasionally, both types 1 and 2 may be diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy. Of all pregnancies in the USA, 3-10% are complicated by diabetes (90% are cases of GDM). Prevalence is higher in certain ethnic groups such as Asian, Afro-Caribbean and Hispanic groups. The fetal morbidity associated with diabetes is shown in Table 12.1. There is a miscarriage rate of 9-14% among women with pre-existing diabetes. Higher rates are seen in those with very poor glycemic control. The risk of a structural anomaly in the fetus is four to eight times the rate in the normal population. The congenital malformation rate in diabetic pregnancy is 5.1-9.8%. Two-thirds of the birth defects affect the cardiovascular and central nervous systems, with neural tube defects being particularly common. The achievement of meticulous preconception glycemic control can reduce the incidence of malformation to near normal. Diabetic pregnancy is linked with the development of large-for-gestational-age babies, but growth restriction in patients with pre-existing type 1 diabetes may also occur, particularly when the diabetes is associated with vascular complications. Fetal macrosomia (affecting 15-45% of babies born to diabetic women) is a frequent complication of diabetic pregnancy and increases the likelihood of birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia and brachial plexus trauma. Perinatal mortality has fallen greatly in diabetic pregnancies but remains approximately twice that observed in non-diabetic pregnancies, with serious congenital malformations accounting for a large proportion of fetal loss.

Close monitoring is mandatory, with retinal assessment at 16 weeks in those with type 1 diabetes and signs of retinopathy at the first antenatal appointment. Hypertension and pre-eclampsia are more common in diabetic mothers. Gestational diabetes mellitus. GDM is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Previously there were no uniformly accepted international standards for the diagnosis of GDM. New evidence has emerged to change practice. The large multinational Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study has demonstrated a linear relationship between maternal hyperglycemia and birth weight, with no apparent threshold effect between maternal glycemia and pregnancy outcome. The Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study in Pregnant Women (ACHOIS) has established that treatment of GDM with insulin improves pregnancy outcomes (such as birth weight, macrosomia and shoulder dystocia). The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has attempted to achieve an international consensus on screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes. It recommends a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all women who are not known to be diabetic at 24-28 weeks. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed when one or more threshold values are exceeded (fasting >= 5.1 mmol/L [92 mg/dL), 1-hour >= 10.0 mmol/L [180 mg/dL], 2-hour >= 8.5 mmol/L [153 mg/dL]).

Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). conservative care and symptom control. dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis). kidney transplant (from a living or cadaveric donor). Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). conservative care and symptom control. dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis). kidney transplant (from a living or cadaveric donor). In general, all patients should be offered all suitable choices, and be fully counseled as to the advantages and disadvantages of each. In reality, however, not all options are available in all centers, and patient-related factors can be limiting. Dialysis may not improve quality of life in patients with extensive comorbidities. Indeed, there is some evidence that very elderly patients, with only limited comorbid illnesses, may not even have the length of their lives prolonged by dialysis. In these circumstances, many patients opt for symptom control without dialysis, using erythropoietin, vitamin D analogs, dietary control, antipruritics and antiemetics as necessary. Such patients often have significantly better quality of life, fewer hospital admissions (exempli gratia from dialysis-related complications), and are more likely to die finally at home rather than in hospital than patients receiving dialysis. Patients need excellent vascular access, and access problems are a major cause of morbidity (Table 12.1). Access is obtained through either a fistula created between a peripheral artery and vein (usually radial or brachial), or a permanent plastic catheter inserted into an internal jugular or subclavian vein (Figure 12.2). Hemodialysis can be carried out in a main hospital center, a satellite unit (often staffed only by nurses) or in the patient's home. Home hemodialysis offers patients the most autonomy, but requires a suitable house with a water supply, space (for the machine and supplies), a reasonably technically competent patient and usually a trained helper who will be present during each dialysis session. Patients dialysing at home often have the best quality of life. Dialysis is usually performed three times each week for about 4 hours. Some patients opt for daily hemodialysis (usually 6 days/week), which provides the best control of fluid balance and biochemistry, but is intensive. Patients can dialyse overnight while they sleep either at home or in dialysis centers. It is difficult to determine the optimum amount of dialysis a patient requires, and various methods are in use. Dialysis and pregnancy. Most women with ESKD on dialysis are infertile, and pregnancy is extremely uncommon. Fertility often returns rapidly after a successful kidney transplant (see below). If women on dialysis do become pregnant, the outcome is usually poor with a very high risk of miscarriage, severe hypertension, small babies and prematurity. Only 47% of women have a successful obstetric outcome. A kidney transplant provides the best long-term outcome for patients with ESKD. A transplant can come from a cadaveric donor, from a living relative or from an unrelated living donor (often called emotionally related). The sale of organs for transplantation is prohibited in almost all countries, but nevertheless continues, mostly because of the severe shortage of organs. All patients with ESKD should be considered for a transplant. Age itself is not a major determinant of outcome, though the presence of comorbid disease adversely affects survival (Table 12.3).

Patients should be aware of the risks and benefits of transplantation (Table 12.4), and require screening for occult cardiovascular disease before surgery. Over 90% of transplants should be working 1 year after surgery. A cadaveric transplant should have a mean survival of 15 years and a living transplant about 18-20 years.","Most patients will require several modalities of renal replacement therapy in their lifetime. Peritoneal dialysis is an excellent modality for many patients, especially early in ESKD. Not all patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) need or want dialysis, and some may be managed conservatively. Hemodialysis requires excellent vascular access; problems with access cause significant morbidity. Most women on dialysis are infertile. Fertility is restored after transplantation, but pregnant transplant recipients have an increased risk of hypertension, miscarriage in the first trimester and premature delivery. Transplantation offers the best long-term outcomes, but at the expense of long-term side effects from immunosuppression, including cancers and cardiovascular disease."," Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis) kidney transplant (from a living or cadaveric donor)  Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease.

More accurate imaging modalities may allow better detection and management of residual or micrometastatic disease, with consequent improvements in the stratification of patients into more appropriate treatment pathways. Improved use of existing therapies. This has been the main focus of work to date, and considerable progress has been made across all stages of bladder cancer. Two surgical trials testing the potential benefit of extended pelvic and iliac lymphadenectomy at the time of radical cystectomy will define the optimal anatomic limits of this surgery., Radiation therapy can be administered more safely at higher doses and with fewer side effects. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can now be safely delivered to many patients and previous definitions of cisplatin-ineligibility have been relaxed. These changes mean that treatment can be given more safely, at more effective doses, for the planned duration, and to a broader range of patients. Many patients now have excellent outcomes with established treatments such as systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy and further improvements could be realized through more widespread use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for suitable patients.

Most of the progress in bladder cancer management in the last 20 years has been in supportive care. This relates to improvement in quality of life through better control of symptoms, reduction in treatment-related toxicity, improved management of comorbidities and involvement of other disciplines such as exercise physiology, where improvements in cancer-specific outcomes can also be shown. There is a risk that quality of life is sacrificed by favoring treatments that have good efficacy but might be toxic. Whilst this is understandable, our patients often tell us that quality of life is more important than extending survival. It is important to recognize this, and to remember when considering the choice of treatment in the setting of incurable cancer, that improvement, or at least maintenance, of quality of life and functioning is a paramount objective. It is heartening to see this growing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes. A further benefit from this approach is the focus on reducing and managing the toxicities of treatment, with consequent improvements in response (and potentially cure) rates as well.","Public health preventative measures are likely to have the greatest influence on bladder cancer outcomes globally. Outcomes in advanced disease are likely to improve through the uptake of new therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as better application of existing evidence and treatments. Improved biological characterization of tumors may point towards more appropriate and patient-specific treatments, including those aimed at specific molecular targets.

9781910797211,ch04,"Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine and restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells. It has improved the quality of patients' lives substantially, and appears to have led to a reduction in mortality. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylation in the brain (Figure 4.1), but this can also occur outside the blood-brain barrier, leading to side effects such as nausea and postural hypotension. The addition of a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, such as carbidopa or benserazide, inhibits dopa decarboxylase in the rest of the body and reduces side effects. The bioavailability of levodopa has been enhanced further by the emergence of drugs such as tolcapone and entacapone, which inhibit catechol- O -methyl transferase (COMT), the enzyme principally responsible for the breakdown of dopamine. Is levodopa toxic? Results of experiments with cultured dopaminergic neurons and with rats previously suggested that levodopa may be toxic to dopamine neurons; it was postulated that levodopa is converted to toxic dopamine metabolites, which cause damage by the production of free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide. The substantia nigra was thought to be at risk because it contains high concentrations of catalysts, such as iron, for free-radical production, and low concentrations of free-radical scavengers. These concerns gave rise to 'levodopa phobia' in many patients, denying them the benefit of levodopa treatment. However, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. A postmortem study of 5 patients with essential tremor, who were mistakenly given sustained levodopa therapy, found no evidence of damage to nigral cells. In addition, patients who receive long-term levodopa for restless legs syndrome show no evidence of damage to the substantia nigra at autopsy. These findings should reassure patients receiving long-term levodopa. In practice, dopamine agonists are also useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa, as well as the many theoretical advantages listed in Table 4.4. Ropinirole and pramipexole are well-established non-ergot dopamine agonists in widespread clinical use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. Both are effective in early and late disease as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. In addition, pramipexole has been investigated for its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects in Parkinson's disease. A direct beneficial effect of pramipexole on depressive symptoms, accounting for 80% of total treatment effect, was found in a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the drug in 287 mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease patients with depressive symptoms. In the 1990s, 8 patients with Parkinson's disease who were taking pramipexole or ropinirole were reported to have fallen asleep while driving, causing accidents. In Europe, this led to a driving ban for patients taking either of the two drugs, although the ban has now been lifted. Since then, similar episodes of unintended sleep have been reported in patients taking other dopaminergic drugs. Daytime sleepiness is likely to be a part of the disease process, which could be aggravated by the use of dopaminergic drugs. This important side effect is discussed in greater detail on pages 136 - (see Sleep disorders). Impulse-control disorders. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) defines impulse control disorders (ICDs) as the failure to resist an impulse, drive or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others. These are increasingly reported in Parkinson's disease and include a range of compulsive disorders (Table 4.5). Typically, the syndrome is characterized by a combination of impulsivity, compulsivity and preoccupation with a behavior or mood state. Unrecognized, ICDs can have serious consequences, such as breakdowns in interpersonal relationships and financial distress. The lifetime prevalence of ICDs, as reported by patients attending specialized clinics, is between 3 and 8%, although the DOMINION study reported a higher rate of 13.7% with ICDs, including problem/pathological gambling (5%), compulsive sexual behavior (3.5%), compulsive buying (5.7%) and binge-eating disorder (4.3%). Men with early-onset Parkinson's disease and a history of alcohol misuse, illicit drug use or affective disorders may be susceptible to this syndrome. Abnormal dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in response to a reward has been postulated as a possible mechanism. The treatment is complex and requires slow withdrawal of dopamine agonists, use of atypical neuroleptics and/or antidepressants, counseling and input from a neuropsychiatrist. PDLIFE study. The argument for treatment of Parkinson's disease at diagnosis has been strengthened by the publication of the UK's prospective PDLIFE study, a national audit of the quality of life of people with Parkinson's disease. Findings indicate a progressive and significant deterioration in the self-reported health status of patients with Parkinson's disease who are left untreated at diagnosis compared with those who are treated. The work has reignited the debate of whether to initiate treatment of the disease at diagnosis or whether to adopt a 'wait and watch' policy. If a neuroprotective agent became available it would be instituted as early as possible, even before the appearance of motor symptoms. Nevertheless, the issue of neuroprotection in Parkinson's disease remains controversial (see pages 89 -). Patients and their carers should be given an opportunity to discuss palliative care issues. No specific agents could be identified as the treatment of choice in either early or advanced disease. The guidelines also emphasize the need for considering non-motor symptoms at all stages of Parkinson's disease. Guidelines for the management of Parkinson's disease in other countries are broadly similar to the NICE guidelines. They include those of the AAN, published in 2002 and modified in 2006, and those issued by the joint task force of the EFNS and the Movement Disorder Society's European Section in 2006. More recent guidelines from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) highlight the following issues as key to the modern 'holistic' treatment of Parkinson's disease. The SIGN's suggested scheme for therapy is shown in Figure 4.5. Dopamine agonist versus levodopa. In younger patients, the issues of neuroprotection and dyskinesias should be considered. The results of four controlled dopamine-agonist monotherapy trials have been published and suggest that initiation of treatment with an agonist is beneficial in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. However, the results of the PD Med study, a multicenter real-life pragmatic study, reporting on quality of life-related outcomes in both young and old patients with Parkinson's disease, is likely to generate considerable controversy regarding the use of dopamine agonists and the choice of initial therapy. In total, 1620 patients with early Parkinson's disease were recruited and given one of three initial treatment regimens. levodopa formulation (528 patients). levodopa-sparing strategy - dopamine agonist (632 patients). levodopa-sparing strategy - MAOB inhibitor (selegiline; 460 patients).

The study started in 2000 with a median follow-up of 3 years and maximum of 7 years. During this time the dopamine agonists varied, including ergot agonists that are no longer in widespread use. The randomization to levodopa or alternative regimens was at the discretion of the clinician and a large part of the study was conducted in centers for the care of the elderly. The findings suggest relatively small but persistent benefits of starting therapy with levodopa rather than the listed alternatives. Interestingly, initial treatment with a MAOB inhibitor appeared to be at least as effective as treatment with a dopamine agonist.","Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately. Fear over the toxicity of levodopa has resulted in levodopa phobia in some patients; however, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. Dopamine agonists are useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa therapy; some, such as rotigotine, may offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation in practice and specifically offer night-time and early morning benefit. Impuse control disorders have emerged as a major complication of mostly dopamine agonist treatment, and monitoring is a must. The findings of the PDLIFE study suggest that early initiation of treatment may be beneficial in terms of health-related quality of life. The treatment of non-motor symptoms is important at all stages of Parkinson's disease. The results of the PANDA study may help people with Parkinson's-associated pain. Treatment decisions should be based on the degree of disability, occupational needs, age, patient/clinician preference and adherence issues; neuroprotection remains a theoretical argument, while dyskinesias and wearing off are an important consideration in younger patients. Trial data indicate that treatment of Parkinson's disease could be initiated with levodopa, oral dopamine agonists or a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor. The PD MED study seems to suggest that initial therapy with levodopa offers a small but persistent benefit compared with the alternatives, and initial MAOB inhibitor treatment is at least as effective as a dopamine agonist."," Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine and restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells. It has improved the quality of patients' lives and appears to have led to a reduction in mortality.  The substantia nigra was thought to be at risk because it contains high concentrations of catalysts, such as iron, for free-radical production, and low concentrations of free-radical scavengers. These concerns gave rise to 'levodopa phobia' in many patients, denying them the benefit of levodopa treatment.  Ropinirole and pramipexole are well-established non-ergot dopamine agonists in widespread clinical use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. Both are effective in early and late disease as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. Pramipexole has been investigated for its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects in Parkinson's disease.  These are increasingly reported in Parkinson's disease and include a range of compulsive disorders. Unrecognized, ICDs can have serious consequences, such as breakdowns in interpersonal relationships and financial distress.

9781908541727,ch03,"Blurred vision. The most common causes of blurred vision are refractive error (in the young) and cataract (in the elderly). However, blurred vision can also be the presenting symptom of potentially blinding intraocular disease such as retinal detachment, or potentially fatal extraocular disease such as vasculitis, brain tumor or stroke. It is essential to be able to clinically triage your patients with blurred vision into the majority for whom routine written referral to an ophthalmologist is appropriate and the minority who require urgent referral (to be seen the same day). Delay in referral of urgent cases, of even a few days, can cost the patient their sight. Patients with none of the features requiring urgent referral may be referred routinely, but should be advised to contact you if there are any major changes in their symptoms while they are waiting to be seen by the ophthalmologist. Causes of acute visual loss. Patients suspected of having any of the diseases outlined in this section should be referred urgently, as immediate ophthalmic medical or surgical treatment may be able to recover or stabilize sight. Retinal detachment. The retina lines the inner aspect of the back wall of the eye and consists of specialist cells called rods and cones (photoreceptors). These cells convert the focused light falling upon the retina to electrical energy to send to the brain to give us vision. The retina also contains the retinal pigment epithelium, which lies beneath the photoreceptors and helps them function, and the neural connections above the photoreceptors which form the optic nerve. Chronic glaucoma causes slow, painless loss of vision, which is usually not noticed by the patient because peripheral vision is lost first. Central vision loss signifies severe disease and can occur if the condition is not detected early by routine population screening. Chronic glaucoma is common, and risk increases with age. People with a family history of glaucoma are at increased risk and may develop the disease at a younger age. Regular examination by an optometrist every 2 years is recommended from the age of 40 to look for signs of glaucoma. If there is a strong family history of glaucoma, annual examination from an earlier age may be required. The examination should include an eye pressure test, optic disc examination and automated visual fields. The eyes of a patient with chronic glaucoma appear entirely normal on examination, apart from raised intraocular pressure (in most but not all patients) and characteristic 'cupping' of one or both optic discs (Figure 3.7). Do not confuse this condition with acute glaucoma, which is much rarer and presents with a painful red eye and blurred vision (see Chapter 2). Diabetic maculopathy. All of your practice's diabetic patients should be enrolled for regular (usually annual) diabetic retinopathy screening. The right time to treat diabetic maculopathy (or proliferative retinopathy) is in its early stages, before it becomes symptomatic. Laser treatments, slow-release steroid injections and anti-VEGF injections are used for this condition. Patients who have advanced diabetic maculopathy that has not been detected by screening complain of blurred vision and metamorphopsia. Early diabetic maculopathy is very difficult to see with the direct ophthalmoscope, particularly without the aid of dilating drops. Advanced cases may show microaneurysms (small red dots) and hard exudates (yellow lipid deposits from leaky microaneurysms) at or near the macula (Figure 3.8). Transient visual loss that is not the prodrome of known migraine is always serious and requires urgent ophthalmic referral. Dangerous causes of non-migrainous transient visual loss include carotid stenosis, heart valve disease, transient ischemic attack and papilledema due to a brain tumor. Transient visual loss in one eye is usually the result of an embolus from a stenosed ipsilateral carotid artery or, less often, an embolus from a cardiac valve. However, in patients over 50, transient visual loss in one eye can also be a warning sign of subsequent permanent visual loss from temporal arteritis (urgent treatment at this stage of temporal arteritis can often avert acute bilateral blindness).","Most patients with blurred vision have benign, slowly progressive conditions and can be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. However, blurred vision may also be the first symptom of potentially sight- or life-threatening disease, and patients suspected of having a serious cause of blurred vision must be referred urgently. All people over 40 should be encouraged to have regular eye checks by their optometrist to look for early signs of glaucoma and other eye disease. Chronic glaucoma is usually asymptomatic until it is very advanced. Please check that all your practice's diabetic patients are enrolled for regular eye screening to detect diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy is best treated at an asymptomatic stage to prevent visual loss. Always consider temporal arteritis if a patient over 50 complains of sudden loss of vision or transient blurring of vision."," Most common causes of blurred vision are refractive error (in the young) and cataract (in the elderly) Blurred vision can also be the presenting symptom of potentially blinding intraocular disease such as retinal detachment.

In this setting, careful attention should be paid to pre-analytic factors that can adversely affect the quality and quantity of nucleic acids in the sample, leading to uninterpretable molecular results. FFPE histological samples represent the gold standard starting material from which to extract nucleic acids for molecular analysis. FFPE specimens contain a high quantity of material for both morphological evaluation and ancillary techniques and do not require additional molecular validation, unlike cytological samples. Molecular reports are a crucial part of molecular laboratories' workflow. They should contain all relevant information to support the clinician's management of the patient, particularly regarding the best treatment choice., For this reason, the communication should be accurate and avoid any misinterpretation by molecular pathologists or clinicians, particularly oncologists or other physicians who request the molecular analysis. At each meeting, the MTB discusses the correct management of individual cancer patients. It is the role of the MTB to decipher the complexity of the cancer genomic landscape and translate it into information useful for patient management. Although there are no guideline recommendations, the MTB should meet at least weekly to discuss cases, especially when particular issues emerge. As well as therapeutic strategies, the meeting provides an opportunity to solve other kinds of problems, such as the type of sample that should be analyzed, the molecular technique and gene panel that should be adopted and the interpretation of molecular results, which is particularly important when unclear or doubtful data have been reported. Costs and reimbursements are crucially important for molecular pathology laboratories offering predictive assays. Owing to a high workload and the necessity of orthogonal technologies (validation process and confirmation of mutational results), laboratories may implement two or more different platforms. Costs. Malapelle et al., in a validation study, demonstrated that the costs of NGS were affordable compared with Sanger sequencing (the gold standard). In this study, patients with advanced CRC were analyzed for clinically relevant mutations in KRAS and NRAS exons 2, 3 and 4 and BRAF exon 15. As far as consumable costs are concerned, Sanger sequencing (a single-gene test) cost at least €28 per reaction, giving a total cost of €196 for the analysis of seven exons. With NGS testing using the Ion Torrent platform (see page 34), 504 mutational hotspot regions in 22 genes can be tested simultaneously for 8 patients using a single 316 chip. In this case, the cost for each patient's analysis was calculated as €187.23.",Different sample types (histological or cytological) have distinct advantages and disadvantages; these are a key issue in molecular analysis.

9781908541024,ch_12,"The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial. The etiology of sporadic brain tumors is unknown, but environmental factors are suspected. Most patients with a family history of primary brain tumors have a hereditary disease that is known to be associated with such tumors, such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, familial polyposis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome. However, some patients do not have any underlying or obvious hereditary disorder that would predispose them to primary brain tumors, but nevertheless give a striking history of these tumors in first-degree relatives. Usually, the tumors are found to be high-grade gliomas. Although it is feasible that germline abnormalities could lead to the development of primary brain tumors in these families, there are a number of unusual demographic features suggesting an environmental rather than genetic explanation for brain tumor clustering. Most cases of confirmed familial cancers are multigenerational, and affected individuals are younger than average for the tumor. However, brain tumor families who do not have one of the recognized hereditary diseases usually involve parent-child and sibling-sibling cases; it is rare for more than two generations to be involved. In addition, the demographics suggest environmental rather than genetic causes in the parent-child and sibling-sibling clusters. These observations suggest that familial exposure to an environmental toxin or ionizing radiation may account for the clustering of primary brain tumors in these families. It is important for clinicians to enquire about any family history of brain tumors, and to be aware of the major syndromes with neoplastic manifestations in the nervous system, so that these diagnoses are not missed. Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate patient surveillance for another occult brain tumor or associated disease, for screening family members, and for genetic counseling. Most patients presenting with primary brain tumors will, however, be sporadic cases and the etiology will remain unknown.

Most patients presenting with primary brain tumors will, however, be sporadic cases and the etiology will remain unknown. Advances in our understanding of the aberrant signaling cascades that result from mutations of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes have resulted in remarkable preliminary results using mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as sirolimus and everolimus, where regression of subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and cortical tubers have been noted. This class of drugs has great potential to alter the clinical manifestations and outcome of this disease. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder in which there is an increased risk of multiple tumors developing in children and young adults, including breast cancer, soft-tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas and primary brain tumors. The incidence of the disorder has not been established, but it is known to be due to a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 on 17p13. Both types of lesion slowly expand as a result of epithelial turnover; dermoid cysts may expand more rapidly as a result of secretions. Symptoms may arise secondary to mass effect or, in some cases, spontaneous rupture or leakage may result in aseptic meningitis. Patients who have recurrent aseptic meningitis should therefore be evaluated for a dermoid or epidermoid cyst. Disseminated fat droplets in the subarachnoid space or ventricular system are diagnostic for a ruptured dermoid cyst. Treatment is resection. Intraoperative leakage of cyst contents may cause cranial neuropathies, aseptic meningitis or secondary hydrocephalus due to obstruction of arachnoid granulations. Complete resection may be more difficult to achieve for epidermoids than for dermoids. Subtotal resection is appropriate when total resection is not feasible. Rathke cleft cysts are usually small asymptomatic abnormalities found on MRI. They can arise in either the sellar or suprasellar region, with 70% of these cysts bridging these two compartments. The lack of calcification may help to distinguish these cysts from craniopharyngiomas. Rarely, Rathke cleft cysts cause pituitary dysfunction, headache or visual disturbance; in these cases, surgical resection is appropriate. Recurrence is rare.","There are several syndromes associated with an inherited predisposition to a variety of brain tumors. However, the vast majority of brain tumors are not inherited. Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate surveillance of individuals at high risk of developing an occult brain tumor or associated disease and for genetic counseling. Cysts are common imaging findings; location, imaging characteristics and other features may help to establish the most likely diagnosis. Recent advances in the molecular biology of familial brain tumor syndromes have suggested new therapies that have the potential to dramatically change the manifestations of these diseases. Dermoids and epidermoids are benign congenital lesions that typically produce symptoms as they gradually increase in size. Total or subtotal resection is the treatment of choice. Colloid cysts should be resected using modern microneuro-surgical techniques."," The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial.

9781910797105,ch05,"Developmental theories and environmental factors. Is schizophrenia a degenerative brain disorder, as originally thought by Kraepelin, or is it better viewed as non-progressive?. During the 1990s, much attention was given to the 'neurodevelopmental hypothesis' of schizophrenia. On the basis of the range of observations outlined in Table 5.1, it was suggested that a static lesion, either genetic or environmental in origin during brain development, expressed its effects as a function of the maturational stage of the brain. In schizophrenia, the characteristic symptoms emerge only during the final stages of brain development in adolescence, when normal 'pruning' or elimination of excess synapses takes place. It is now known that schizophrenia results in part from a developmentally regulated disconnection of higher order association areas, through alterations in neuronal migration, synapse formation and myelination. Some established risk factors act early in life (Table 5.2). Obstetric complications generally appear to increase the risk of schizophrenia. During pregnancy, risk factors include rubella and influenza infections in the first or second trimester and antepartum bleeding. Asphyxia and low birth weight, especially with intrauterine growth retardation, are risk factors at birth, as are certain brain insults and infections in childhood. Use of cannabis and amphetamine-like drugs has long been known to be an important trigger of relapse, but had not been thought to directly cause the onset of illness. However, several cohort studies since 2000 have shown that use of cannabis doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia. The risk is further increased if minor psychotic symptoms pre-exist and if cannabis use starts early in adolescence. Research suggests that this effect of cannabis may be mediated by a particular gene. Those with a specific version of the catechol- O -methyltransferase (COMT) gene, carried by about a quarter of the general population, appear to be especially prone to psychosis after cannabis use.

9781908541420,ch_6,"Combination therapy. A series of clinical trials have shown that the inhaled LABAs salmeterol and formoterol, when administered to patients who are already taking inhaled corticosteroids but whose asthma is poorly controlled, may produce greater improvements in pulmonary function and symptom control than would be obtained by doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. Combinations of an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA - specifically, fluticasone propionate and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol and fluticasone propionate and formoterol - are now available in single inhalers. The addition of a LABA is indicated for all whose asthma fails to be controlled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid. It would seem, therefore, that the dose-response curve for topical corticosteroids is not linear, and that the overall benefits obtained with doses of up to approximately 400 µg HFA-beclometasone dipropionate per day or equivalent are as great as those that can be achieved with further increments (HFA refers to the propellant hydrofluoroalkane-134a). One possible explanation for these observations is that topical corticosteroids are able to control the inflammatory response by inhibiting cytokine and other relevant pathways. They are not able to alter, at least in the short and medium term, the behavior of the remodeled airway with its increased smooth muscle, microvasculature and thickened airway walls. In this situation, drugs that act on the airway smooth muscle and microvasculature to restore airway physiology to normal, such as a LABA, are likely to be effective. All controller and reliever combination medications are indicated to be taken regularly, usually twice daily, as a preventative for asthma exacerbation and to control the underlying airway inflammation characteristic of asthma. The formulation of budesonide and formoterol combination treatment can be used as a single inhaler to deliver both maintenance preventive treatment as well as being used as a reliever. This means patients have only one inhaler for both their controller and reliever therapy. Some trials indicate that this approach can be effective in preventing exacerbations as patients will receive increased inhaled corticosteroid as well as bronchodilator therapy at the first sign of worsening symptoms as they use their reliever medications. Currently, the only single inhaler approach to demonstrate effective regular preventer and as-needed reliever therapy in clinical studies is the budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler as formoterol (unlike salmeterol) has a rapid onset of action, enabling its use as a reliever medication in a single-inhaler treatment plan. Current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma treatment, depending on disease control (Table 4.5), in both adults and children (Figure 4.6). All patients should aim to have well-controlled asthma, and treatment should be stepped up or down, as appropriate, every 1-3 months to achieve and maintain asthma control. Recommended management strategies suggest five treatment steps. Patients should be started on therapy appropriate to the initial level of symptoms: step 2 is appropriate for most patients who are receiving no, or only as-needed, bronchodilator treatment for asthma, and step 3 is appropriate for those with more uncontrolled symptoms and reduced lung function at the start of treatment.

Depending on symptom severity and the presence of exacerbations, treatment should be continued at a given level for 1-3 months before considering escalation or reduction. Generally, after 3 months of well-controlled asthma a step down to a lower level of treatment should be considered.

Generally, after 3 months of well-controlled asthma a step down to a lower level of treatment should be considered. An alternative method of delivering therapy at this or later stages of management is a combined inhaled corticosteroid/LABA for both preventer and reliever therapy. This relies on the use of a rapid- and long-acting beta -agonist (formoterol) in combination with a low-dose formulation of inhaled corticosteroid (usually budesonide, 200-400 µg twice daily) to be used as both controller and reliever therapy. This treatment has the advantage of convenience, as well as enabling the delivery of increased doses of inhaled corticosteroid for symptoms, thereby increasing anti-inflammatory controller treatment at the first sign of worsening symptoms. Evidence supports this approach for reducing asthma exacerbations. A potential concern with this approach is that patients may not take regular controller medication, and education therefore needs to emphasize the importance of using the budesonide/formoterol inhaler for both regular maintenance as well as reliever treatment. Written treatment plan. All patients with asthma should have a written plan that describes their current step of asthma treatment and advises on treatment adjustments to accommodate worsening asthma (see Chapter 6). For many patients, such a plan will also involve instructions to take oral corticosteroids or seek medical advice for prescription of oral corticosteroid treatment.","Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks. Asthma therapy should be tailored to disease severity; current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment. If recommended treatment fails, adherence and diagnosis should be re-examined before treatment is escalated. Any exacerbation should prompt a review of maintenance medications. Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy. Increased use of relievers (short-acting beta -agonists) indicates inadequate disease control. All patients with asthma should have a written asthma action plan."," Combinations of an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA are now available in single inhalers.

9781908541680,ch_8,"Behavioral therapy - the collective name for the various methods and strategies used to bring about changes in lifestyle - is universally credited as being one of the three main pillars of weight management, alongside dietary modification and increased physical activity (Chapters 5 and). Bringing about a change in behavior is an important part of clinical care; the ability to foster such change in patients is fundamental to the skill base of any health professional. Changing patients' habits and attitudes using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is key to long-term obesity management. Goal setting: the agreement of realistic weight-loss targets, at a realistic rate of improvement. Self-monitoring: increasing self-awareness of eating patterns and physical activity behavior, which is an essential precursor for change. Stimulus control: avoiding situations that lead to harmful behavior, and promoting situations that influence healthy activity. emotional feelings or triggers involved. levels of activity. A food and activity diary should clarify eating patterns and behaviors, particularly events that trigger eating, with a view to changing those patterns once they have been identified, for instance by planning ahead. Once the pattern of eating has been established, the diary can be used as part of the treatment plan, by recording progress towards dietary goals. Long-term weight management has been shown to improve when food records are used. Binge eating disorder (BED) is specifically recognized in its own right in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the broadly accepted manual for mental illness classification, published by the American Psychiatric Association. Patients with BED display the features of bulimia nervosa but without the purging, abnormal exercise regimens or other compensatory behavior to induce weight loss (see also Fast Facts: Eating Disorders). The condition was largely ignored when it was first recognized in 1959 but has recently gained greater prominence.","Behavioral therapy, alongside diet and lifestyle advice, is one of the three key components of obesity management. Techniques include goal setting, self-monitoring and stimulus control. A person's degree of motivation and expectations should be assessed.

9781910797457,chp8,"Antiandrogens. When the serum PSA level rises after a period of ADT alone, an initial step may be to add an antiandrogen to the treatment. This may transiently reduce PSA, but the PSA will usually start to rise again relatively soon. Withdrawal of the antiandrogen at this time produces a favorable PSA response in approximately 40% of men for 4-6 months. This phenomenon has been ascribed to a mutation affecting androgen receptors in malignant tissue which means that the antiandrogen acts as an agonist (stimulatory) rather than an antagonist (blocker), so when the antiandrogen is withdrawn the stimulation is reduced; a similar phenomenon occurs in breast cancer treated with antiestrogens. As long as the patient is asymptomatic, the addition and withdrawal of different antiandrogens can be continued for 2-3 cycles, as previous antiandrogen administration does not appear to diminish the response to different antiandrogens.

Enzalutamide is an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor, approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC either prior to chemotherapy or after previous docetaxel treatment. It inhibits nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor, DNA binding and coactivator recruitment (Figure 8.5), and has a greater affinity for the receptor than non-steroidal antiandrogens; it does not have any agonist activity (see Table 8.1). In the PREVAIL trial in men with metastatic CRPC who had not had prior chemotherapy, oral enzalutamide, 160 mg/day, was associated with a 29% improvement in survival compared with placebo. Enzalutamide was associated with fatigue, diarrhea and hot flashes. Docetaxel, a member of the taxoid family, induces apoptosis through microtubule stabilization; it has been established as first-line therapy for M1 CRPC for many years. A randomized trial (TAX-327) in men with CRPC found that a 3-week schedule of docetaxel was superior to mitoxantrone plus prednisone in terms of disease progression and OS (see Table 8.1). The incidence of neutropenia, skin reactions and gastrointestinal problems was higher with docetaxel than with mitoxantrone plus prednisone. These are the most common side effects with docetaxel but in general the chemotherapeutic agent is well tolerated. Second-line therapy. Treatment options when prostate cancer progresses after docetaxel chemotherapy include further chemotherapy, one of the new hormonal modulation agents or targeted alpha therapy. Cabazitaxel. This taxane chemotherapy was developed to overcome the resistance that can develop as a result of docetaxel treatment. In the TROPIC study, men with CRPC that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomized to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone. Those who received cabazitaxel demonstrated a 30% improvement in survival compared with those receiving mitoxantrone (15.1 versus 12.7 months; Figure 8.6 and see Table 8.1). Side effects were similar to those seen with docetaxel. Mitoxantrone and prednisone was the first chemotherapy combination to be tested in a randomized trial in advanced prostate cancer. The combination was very well tolerated and more than doubled the time of palliation response compared with prednisone alone. It also improved the quality of life of men with CRPC. It has now been replaced by docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy and by cabazitaxel as second-line chemotherapy, which have better efficacy; however, the combination still has a place in second-line therapy when resistance to docetaxel has developed and cabazitaxel is not an option. Abiraterone. In a study in men with metastatic CRPC for whom docetaxel chemotherapy had failed, abiraterone plus prednisone resulted in a 35% improvement in survival compared with prednisone alone (see Table 8.1). Mineralocorticoid-related adverse events, including fluid retention, hypertension and hypokalemia, were more frequent in the abiraterone group, highlighting the continuing dependency of CRPC on androgen-receptor signaling even after it has become castrate resistant (see Table 8.1). Therapies that modulate the immune system are showing considerable promise in trials of CRPC. These therapies take time to mediate an effect and are therefore best used in men with minimal or no symptoms. Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy. In a phase III trial of men with CRPC not previously treated with docetaxel, treatment with sipuleucel-T resulted in a 22% relative reduction in the risk of death compared with placebo, with minimal side effects (see Table 8.1). This is the first immunotherapy to demonstrate a survival advantage in prostate cancer; however, treatment is complicated and requires a specialized laboratory, which makes it extremely expensive to administer. Focal external-beam radiotherapy is a well-established treatment, providing rapid improvement in pain in up to 80% of men. Treatment can be given as either a single fraction or as multiple fractions over 2-3 weeks. This type of irradiation is associated with very few side effects. Wide-field radiation may also be useful in patients with intractable diffuse pain. It can delay the progression of existing disease as well as slow the occurrence of new disease, but is associated with side effects such as pneumonitis, cataracts, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in approximately 35% of patients, and severe, sometimes irreversible, hematological effects in 9%. Bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption and demineralization, providing symptomatic benefit in some patients. A study involving over 600 men with CRPC demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of patients with bone-related events among those receiving zoledronic acid (zoledronate), given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks, compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid also significantly delayed the onset of first skeletal-related event (see Table 8.1); however, the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one death is 10. Side effects with bisphosphonates include renal deterioration and, rarely, osteonecrosis of the jaw. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand); it inhibits osteoclast function and bone turnover. A randomized trial involving 1904 men with CRPC supported denosumab as the optimal medication to reduce bone-related events in men with CRPC (see Table 8.1).","After an initial response to androgen ablation, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value starts to rise as a result of androgen-insensitive cell clones. As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen. The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy. The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone is now also licensed for use before chemotherapy, and trials of other antiandrogens prior to chemotherapy are under way. When docetaxel chemotherapy has failed, second-line therapies such as cabazitaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone (a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis), enzalutamide (an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor) and radium-223 (targeted alpha therapy) have been shown to improve survival and quality of life. Immunotherapy for CRPC may be best implemented before significant symptoms appear. External-beam radiotherapy may provide useful control of pain from bone metastases. The monoclonal antibody denosumab and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have been reported to significantly delay bone-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer."," When serum PSA level rises after ADT, an initial step may be to add an antiandrogen to the treatment.

9781910797815,chp7,"Pacritinib is an inhibitor of both JAK2 and FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), an enzyme that is important in the development of the hematopoietic and immune systems. The efficacy of this agent in patients with myelofibrosis has been evaluated in two randomized Phase III trials: PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2. PERSIST-1 excluded patients who had previously received JAK2 inhibitors whereas such patients were eligible to enter PERSIST-2. In PERSIST-1, the primary endpoint was at least 35% reduction in spleen volume, and a secondary endpoint was at least 50% reduction in total symptom scores; these were co-primary endpoints in PERSIST-2. Both trials showed pacritinib to be superior to best available therapy in terms of spleen and symptom responses. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia). Momelotinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor. In the SIMPLIFY-1 trial in JAK2 inhibitor-naive patients with myelofibrosis, momelotinib produced comparable spleen responses to ruxolitinib but less control of symptoms.

At 2 years, a complete hematologic response (European LeukemiaNet criteria) was achieved in 71% of patients receiving ropeginterferon alfa-2b compared with 49% of patients receiving hydroxyurea (p = 0.010); the proportion of patients with both complete hematologic response and symptomatic improvement was also numerically higher with ropeginterferon alfa-2b (50%, versus 37% with hydroxyurea; not significant). Partial molecular response (reduction in mutant JAK2 allele burden) was achieved in 70% of patients receiving ropeginterferon alfa-2b, compared with 29% of those receiving hydroxyurea (p = 0.005). Furthermore, in contrast to the hydroxyurea group, the response rates continued to improve over the 2-year treatment period in patients receiving ropeginterferon alfa-2b. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b was associated with lower rates of anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia than hydroxyurea, and there were no treatment- or disease-related secondary malignancies. Other therapeutic targets. Many therapies targeting diverse molecular targets are currently being investigated in myelofibrosis (Table 7.1). Telomerase inhibitors. Telomerase controls the addition of telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes and is therefore essential for chromosome stability. Expression of telomerase is increased in MPNs,, suggesting that this enzyme may represent a potential therapeutic target. In a study with the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat, involving 33 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis, complete or partial responses were achieved in 21%. All four patients who had complete responses also showed reductions in bone marrow fibrosis. The most common adverse events were myelotoxicity and transient reductions in liver enzymes. However, a Phase II study in patients with relapsed or refractory myelofibrosis following treatment with ruxolitinib has been suspended. Several treatments are currently being evaluated for use in combination with ruxolitinib, in order to enable an adequate dose of ruxolitinib (exempli gratia by increasing the platelet count) or to improve the response; some of the combinations are listed in Table 7.2.

Both FVIII and FIX are normally made in the liver (FVIII in liver endothelial cells and FIX in hepatocytes). However, diverse cell types are capable of producing functional coagulation factors, and tight regulation of gene expression is not required as the therapeutic range is wide. For example, raising coagulation activity to above 5% changes the disease phenotype to mild, typically requiring few additional factor infusions. A large number of approaches, utilizing different gene transfer vectors and cell types for transgene expression, were initially explored during the 1990s. Since then, in vivo gene transfer to hepatocytes using AAV vectors has emerged as the leading method, and this is being evaluated in three Phase III trials and multiple more Phase I/II trials (Table 4.3, Figure 4.2). Various viral capsids have been adapted that allow for the transduction of hepatocytes after injection into a peripheral vein, and tissue-specific promoters are employed to restrict transgene expression to hepatocytes. CAR-T therapy for lymphoma and leukemia. Adoptive lymphocyte therapy using gene-modified autologous T cells is one of the technologies revolutionizing cancer therapy. T cells are harvested from the patient's blood and transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) by ex vivo gene transfer using retroviral or lentiviral vectors (Figure 4.3). Early success has been shown with blood cancers. In pioneering work, CAR-T cells directed against the CD19 antigen were able to effectively kill lymphoma cells from patients refractory to conventional chemotherapy. CAR-T cells targeting CD19 are now approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of several types of blood cancer. These include: relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children and young adults; and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in adults. CARs have a modular design and comprise an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv, the extracellular binding domain that targets the intact tumor surface antigen), a hinge region, a transmembrane domain and intracellular signaling domains. Expression of the CAR re-directs the T cells to the tumor antigen and provides the signals required for T-cell activation on binding to the antigen. Importantly, targeting of the intact antigen via scFv binding is neither MHC restricted nor dependent on co-receptors or epitope processing. CARs are broadly classified by the number of co-stimulatory domains that have been incorporated into the intracellular portion of the molecule. First-generation CARs contained only CD3zed chain, while second- or third-generation CARs have CD3zed plus one or more co-stimulatory domains, respectively (Figure 4.4). Current commercial designs are based on second-generation CARs. Future (fourth) generation CARs are being developed with inducible signaling.","Gene therapy, using gene-modified cells or in vivo gene transfer, has now been successful for diverse diseases and modes of gene transfer. After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for Leber congenital amaurosis and spinal muscular atrophy are now approved medicines in the USA and rely on in vivo injection to, respectively, the subretinal space and systemic circulation. Multiple gene therapies for hemophilia, based on hepatic AAV gene transfer, have elevated coagulation factor activities in patients to the normal or near normal range. These are now being evaluated in Phase III trials.

The major circulatory complications are increased total and pulmonary blood volume, high cardiac output and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

'Metabolic syndrome' describes the clustering in an individual of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, namely abdominal obesity (Figure 3.1), abnormal glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia and hypertension. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) updated the definition of metabolic syndrome in 2005, making abdominal obesity a requirement for a diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, and providing different obesity cut-off points for different ethnic groups. This definition takes account of the fact that central adiposity is common to each component of the metabolic syndrome. The criteria are summarized in Table 3.1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease. Moreover, recent data have clearly shown that aggressive early management confers the best chance to prevent, or at the very least substantially delay, both progression of the disease and emergence of cardiovascular and other complications. Once complications are established very tight control is less beneficial. Also see Fast Facts: Diabetes Mellitus. Management of obese patients at risk of or with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Weight loss. Several major studies have shown that a modest reduction in weight by intensive lifestyle modification alone reduces the cumulative incidence of diabetes by 58% (Figure 3.3). Weight loss of 0.5-9.0 kg is associated with a 30-40% reduction in diabetes-related mortality.","Obesity significantly affects cardiometabolic status and risk. Lipid disorders and hypertension are exacerbated by obesity and add to cardiovascular risk. Weight loss rapidly and effectively reduces cardiovascular risk and the burden of atrial fibrillation, and improves cardiac function. The metabolic syndrome defines the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors under the umbrella of obesity. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the comorbidity most closely linked with obesity. Weight loss prevents the disease in those at risk and improves glycemic control when it is present."," Obesity is associated with hypertension, tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy, increased collagen deposition, reduced cardiac contractility and increased end-diastolic pressure.
