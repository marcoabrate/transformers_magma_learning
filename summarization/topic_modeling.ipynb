They can aid\n","communication in patients who have severe dysarthria, and also delineate the nature of swallowing problems in MS . The occupational therapist works\n","with the patient to allow them to remain independent for as long as possible . The nutritionist can help plan a diet that is high in fiber to improve\n","bowel function in patients with constipation . The risk of osteoporosis may increase in patients with MS, for which the dietitian can recommend a diet\n","rich in calcium or, when required, supplements such as vitamin D and calcium . Patients may not always be aware of their entitlement, and for various\n","reasons may struggle with completing forms . Rehousing to incorporate the needs of the patient and their family requires vital input from social\n","workers . Patient rights - education and employment . It is therefore important that people with MS receive appropriate information and support to\n","assist them to stay in education and employment for as long as possible . The specific diagnosis does not need to be disclosed to employers at\n","interview (although disability will usually need to be) . In the UK, for example, employers must be informed of the diagnosis if employment is in the\n","armed forces, on a plane or on a ship .

The regulations speak to basic protections for human research\n","participants in subpart A, known as the Common Rule . Additional subparts speak to protections for vulnerable populations, including children and\n","prisoners . The three core principles of biomedical ethics described in the Belmont Report are at the core of research ethics and should be carefully\n","considered during the study design phase and ethics review process . Respect for persons is demonstrated through the informed consent process, which\n","occurs when a person is given the information needed to make a sound decision about whether to volunteer to willingly participate . How this\n","information is conveyed is important because volunteering to be a research participant is different from, say, accepting terms of service (ToS) to\n","access an app, or signing a consent form to obtain medical care . Consent to participate in research is a choice that an individual can only make if\n","presented with information in a setting conducive to good decision-making . The informed consent process involves more than signing a form to document\n","voluntary participation - it is the first of what may be many interactions between a participant and the research team and is part of developing a\n","trusted relationship . Technological literacy is another important consideration . For informed consent to be meaningful, participants will need to be\n","'tech-literate' enough to understand the specifics of how their data will be obtained and used . Moving forward, this charge will require a commitment\n","from the medical community to provide accessible public-facing educational modules . A participant may also think that if the study team has access to\n","their health data in real time, 24/7, then that means someone is paying attention to them (which may not be the case) . One organization working to\n","advance meaningful informed consent in digital health research is Sage Bionetworks; it has published a toolkit to assist researchers . Determining\n","risk of harm is a somewhat subjective process, yet worth breaking down . Thus, the same potential harm presents a low risk for most, but a high risk\n","for some important groups . Safeguarding data and managing data-sharing protocols are important considerations when applying the principle of\n","beneficence, and researchers, IRBs and research participants need to think about carefully these . Research is inherently risky because we are\n","learning something that is not yet known . Research participants are often told about risks as an odds ratio . For example, in studies that include a\n","test for maximum oxygen uptake, participants are required to exercise to exhaustion . Because of this particular risk of harm, the research team can\n","mitigate risk by having access to personnel and equipment used to treat a cardiac event . There is no potential benefit of knowledge gain if the study\n","is poorly designed and the tools are not trustworthy . The principle of justice focuses on the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of\n","research and recruitment protocols that are inclusive of those most likely to benefit from knowledge gained . To do that requires that we design\n","technologies that are accessible and, in some cases, culturally tailored . With that in mind, including end users in the development process who\n","represent a wide cross-section of our society is one way we can be responsive to the principle of justice . For example, in a study designed to\n","increase physical activity in refugee women, the researcher decided to use a wrist-worn accelerometer to assess daily movement . The participants were\n","given the sensor and shown how to use it . One week later, the researcher returned to gather the measurement tools and found that no data had been\n","collected .

Additionally, it correlates with epilepsy severity: psychosis occurs in 0.6-7% of patients with\n","epilepsy in the community and 19-27% of patients with epilepsy who require hospitalization . Postictal psychosis generally begins years after the\n","onset of epilepsy . Patients with bilateral seizure foci, bilateral limbic lesions and clusters of complex partial seizures are at particularly high\n","risk . Compared with patients with schizophrenia, patients with interictal psychosis have an absence of negative symptoms, better premorbid state,\n","less deterioration of personality and better response to pharmacotherapy .

Patients who obtain life insurance through their\n","place of employment generally do not have a problem .\n","\n","Prediction:\n"," The three most common psychiatric comorbidities in patients with epilepsy are depression, anxiety\n","and psychosis. Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up\n","to 55% of patients in some studies. The overall suicide rate in depressed patients with epilepsy is\n","five times higher than that in the general population.\n","\n","Reference:\n","Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative\n","impact on quality of life. The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety\n","pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures.

When psychotropic\n","medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of\n","potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and\n","to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace.

practitioners take significant time and effort to prepare patients adequately for their first course of\n","chemotherapy . Outcomes are improved by following the recommendations of national or international guidelines for CINV . All of the guidance for\n","managing CINV in this book adheres to these international guidelines . Management principles . The route of delivery will depend on what the patient\n","is best able to tolerate . In general, antiemetics given either orally or intravenously in appropriate doses have equivalent efficacy . Highly\n","emetogenic chemotherapy . The recommended doses for these agents are shown in Table 4.3 . Women with breast cancer receiving AC chemotherapy have a\n","particularly high risk of CINV and are included in these recommendations . Choice of antiemetic agent . Many clinical institutions have pharmacy\n","committees that provide recommendations or formularies for specific antiemetic regimens . These recommendations should be based on cost, efficacy and\n","toxicity . Choice of 5-HT RA . In the first trial, intravenous palonosetron, 0.25 mg and 0.75 mg, was compared with intravenous ondansetron, 32 mg .\n","In the second trial, palonosetron, 0.75 mg, was compared with granisetron, 40 μg/kg . In addition, a meta-analysis of 16 randomized clinical trials\n","compared palonosetron to the first-generation 5-HT RAs . As discussed on page 34, this meta-analysis revealed that palonosetron is statistically\n","superior in the acute, delayed and overall phases . Ondansetron, granisetron and (oral) dolasetron are available as generics; palonosetron is not\n","available as a generic and has a higher acquisition cost . Tropisetron is distributed in various countries worldwide, but is not available in the USA\n",". International guidelines recommend the use of palonosetron as the preferred agent because of its higher efficacy compared with ondansetron or\n","granisetron (see above) . Choice of NK-1 RA . Aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant and rolapitant have all been shown to be safe and effective in\n","phase III clinical trials, with few adverse events (see Chapter 3) . Rolapitant does not induce CYP3A4 . To date, no definitive clinical trials have\n","directly compared the efficacy and safety of the various NK-1 RAs . All patients in both arms received standard doses of dexamethasone . There\n","appeared to be no significant differences in adverse events or in the prevention of CINV between NEPA and the aprepitant-ondansetron combination . A\n","formal statistical comparison of the NEPA and aprepitant/ondansetron arms was not reported . For the present, the choice among these agents may be\n","based on cost and the availability of oral or intravenous forms . Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy . At present there is no consensus as to whether\n","to administer dexamethasone on days 2-3 . Low or minimally emetogenic chemotherapy . High-dose chemotherapy . The cause of CINV in this setting is\n","multifactorial . Contributing causes include the use of prophylactic antibiotics, narcotic analgesics administered for the management of mucositis and\n","total-body irradiation . A complete response (significant reduction in emesis without increasing toxicity or use of rescue medication) was\n","demonstrated in 82% of those receiving aprepitant compared with 66% in those who did not . A total of 362 patients were available for the efficacy\n","analysis, with 181 in each treatment arm . The complete response rate was significantly greater in the aprepitant group than the control group (58% vs\n","41%) . CINV in children . The incidence and severity of CINV in the pediatric age group is similar to that in adults . The use of antiemetics should\n","follow the same principles as those used to treat adults . The use of corticosteroids has depended on the risk:benefit ratio in specific age groups\n","and the particular chemotherapy regimen being used . Recently, aprepitant has been recommended for use in various age groups and various clinical\n","applications . To date, there have been no studies in children with netupitant or rolapitant .\n","\n","Prediction:\n"," Aprepitant, fosaprepitant, netupitant and rolapitant have all been shown to be safe and effective\n","in phase III clinical trials, with few adverse events. Palonosetron, granisetron and (oral)\n","dolasetron are available as generics; palonosetron is not available as a generic and has a higher\n","acquisition cost.\n","\n","Reference:\n","The primary goal of CINV therapy is the prevention of nausea and vomiting. Patients should be\n","individually evaluated for their specific risk factors as well as the level of anxiety present\n","before the first course of treatment. Outcomes are improved by following international guidelines\n","when selecting the antiemetic regimen to use in relation to emetogenicity of the type of\n","chemotherapy involved. The triple-drug regimen of a NK-1 receptor antagonist (RA), 5-HT RA and\n","dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The two-drug\n","combination of palonosetron and dexamethasone is recommended for patients receiving moderately\n","emetogenic chemotherapy. A single 8-mg dose of dexamethasone before chemotherapy is recommended for\n","patients receiving low emetogenic chemotherapy; no antiemetic should be administered routinely for\n","patients receiving minimally emetogenic chemotherapy. The final choice of antiemetic agent will\n","depend on efficacy, toxicity and cost. To determine overall cost-effectiveness of any given regimen,\n","the acquisition cost of the antiemetic agent should be weighed against the probability and cost of\n","post-chemotherapy visits to the clinic or emergency department and/or admissions to hospital. The\n","incidence and severity of CINV in children is similar ito that in adults. The use of antiemetics in\n","children should follow the same principles as those used to treat adults.\n","\n","####################################################################################################\n","\n","(9781908541703, 'ch_4')\n","Breast cancer is an enigmatic disease . The risk of breast cancer begins at puberty and rises slowly until the perimenopausal years, when it increases\n","dramatically, eventually leveling off at about the age of 75 years . Women who do not start menses, seldom get breast cancer . Breast cancer stage\n","appears to be a biological property of the tumor rather than simply an expression of anatomic spread . The natural history of breast cancer is\n","determined by the stage at diagnosis; thus, the risk of recurrence of a stage II tumor is inherently higher than that of a stage I tumor . When breast\n","cancer recurs, it can show a variety of presentations, depending on the time to relapse and the site of recurrence . The anatomic distribution of the\n","disease shows several curious clusters . Bony metastases can wax and wane for years . Occasionally, the disease is explosive in both time and\n","distribution, mimicking an infectious process . Breast biology . To appreciate the significance of the observations outlined above, it is helpful to\n","consider the development of the human breast and breast cancer as a biological process . It is, perhaps, a truism to suggest that breast cancer is the\n","result of a subtle imbalance in the complex regulatory cycles to which breast tissue is exposed . It is the combination of such 'host' and tumor\n","factors that will determine the clinical pattern of the disease . The incidence of breast cancer is age related perhaps because multiple defects are\n","involved; the clinical stage and pattern of disease are functions of these defects . Moreover, cancer as a process extends beyond the cancer cell .\n","Breast cancer is fundamentally different (Figure 3.4) . The risk of recurrence, on a proportionate basis, remains constant for life and is determined\n","by the initial stage of the tumor . Moreover, periods of increased recurrence risk 2-3 years after diagnosis have been observed . The treatment\n","guidelines presented in Fast Facts: Breast Cancer have been derived from a classic model of the disease, which is now evolving rapidly . As breast\n","cancer is more fully understood as a systemic regulatory disease with events at the time of surgery critical for outcome, treatment strategies will\n","change, and perhaps the enigma will begin to dissipate . Structure of the breast and surrounding tissues . The blood supply to the breast has two main\n","components . Benign breast disease . Although a lump is the first symptom in 80-90% of cases of breast cancer, about 80% of lumps are due to benign\n","breast disease (Table 3.1) . Solitary cysts are among the most common benign breast tumors in women aged 35-55 years . Fibroadenomas account for 13%\n","of all breast tumors and are most common in women under 30 years of age, in whom they account for 60% of palpable lumps . Excision is considered\n","appropriate in older women to avoid the risk of overlooking breast cancer, unless the diagnosis has been confirmed by image-guided core biopsy .\n","Breast cancer . Histologically, breast cancers are characterized by groups of abnormal cells in a matrix of normal fibrous tissue . Ductal carcinomas\n","account for over 90% of breast cancers . Lobular carcinomas account for approximately 8% of breast cancers . Such tumors may occur at several sites,\n","either in the same breast or in both breasts . Natural history of breast cancer . At one extreme, albeit rare, women may present with massive\n","involvement of the axillary nodes or even bone-marrow infiltration and a virtually undetectable primary tumor, and die of breast cancer before the\n","primary disease is clinically apparent .

This chapter focuses on the diagnostic use of imaging in patients with suspected\n","glioma/glioblastoma . The role of imaging in the management of patients with glioblastoma is discussed in Chapter 4 .

Anatomic magnetic\n","resonance imaging . All patients with suspected or confirmed glioblastoma should have an MRI scan . T2-weighted and FLAIR images are most valuable for\n","estimating macroscopic tumor boundaries: FLAIR increases the overall contrast between the tumor and normal brain tissue, and may thus facilitate\n","lesion detection, while the loss of grey-white matter detail, indicative of tumor, is well delineated on T2 images . For this reason, T2 imaging\n","should always be reviewed when assessing the extent of glioma infiltration . Microscopic tumor infiltration, which is a typical feature of\n","glioblastoma, remains occult on anatomic MRI . Similarly, imaging cannot reliably differentiate between peritumoral edema and infiltration . Numerous\n","anatomic imaging features have been explored as biomarkers of glioma subtype, specifically glioblastoma . Distant metastases, however, are virtually\n","non-existent, so staging can be achieved from brain imaging only . Structural features on imaging, particularly calcification, and younger patient age\n","can support the identification of oligodendrogliomas (Figure 3.4) . DWI (b1000) and ADC must be interpreted in conjunction and are often assessed\n","qualitatively in clinical practice by reporting the presence or absence of restricted diffusion as a tumor feature .

The adoption of broad NGS gene panels (Table 3.1)\n","may support the administration of immunotherapy drugs in patients harboring high TMB (see page 45) . Another potentially valuable approach is hybrid\n","capture-based CGP, an ultra-sensitive assay that can be used to detect variants even in specimens with low tumor purity (a low proportion of tumor\n","cells) . As far as variants are concerned and, in particular, when rare or unknown mutations are reported, it is fundamentally important to define the\n","association with the risk of cancer development and progression . Single nucleotide variants in coding and intronic regions can significantly alter\n","the functions of cancer-related genes . PCR-based techniques involve comparing the profiles of microsatellite loci generated by amplification from\n","neoplastic samples and corresponding normal tissue material obtained from the same patient . In May 2017, the FDA approved the use of an immune\n","checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) in advanced stage solid tumors with MSI-H (evaluated by PCR or NGS) or dMMR (evaluated by IHC) status .

However, as WES is currently unfeasible in routine clinical practice, with its high costs and long turnaround time, several different\n","approaches are now employed, based on wide NGS panels . Patients were defined as having a high TMB when the tumor DNA harbored at least ten mutations\n","per megabase . Different gene panels are available to evaluate TMB status (see Table 3.1) . Data interpretation potentially limits the usefulness of\n","TMB analysis, regardless of the approach adopted (WES versus wide gene panels) and gene panel employed . underlined the positive predictive value for\n","immunotherapy when mutations in genes involved in DNA repair and replication are identified, Skoulidis et al . RNA-based molecular approaches, such as\n","reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), NGS and multiplex digital color-coded barcode technology, play a key role in identifying targetable gene fusions\n","(Figure 3.3) . Another important field of application for RNA-based molecular approaches is the identification of splice variants . As for gene\n","fusions, the presence of a splice variant may have a predictive role for therapy . This limitation can be overcome by NGS, which allows the\n","identification of known and unknown gene alterations for different patients simultaneously . This is a multiplex digital color-coded barcode\n","technology that can identify gene fusions and splice variants simultaneously . In addition, the nCounter technology is able to identify several gene\n","fusions and splice variants, even when RNA is of low quality and target capture amplification fails .\n","\n","Prediction:\n"," The adoption of broad NGS gene panels may support the administration of immunotherapy drugs in\n","patients harboring high TMB.
