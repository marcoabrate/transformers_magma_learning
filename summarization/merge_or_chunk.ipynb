Exercise-induced asthma is particularly common in children and\n","approximately 80% of children with asthma will have evidence of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. For some individuals with brittle asthma, the\n","response to exercise can be severe and may be a strong disincentive to exercise. Exercise-induced asthma appears to be more common in those with\n","allergies to inhaled substances and often occurs on exercise in very cold weather. A feature of exercise-induced asthma is a refractory period,\n","whereby induction of exercise-induced asthma appears to be protective for further episodes for a period of several hours. Thus, individuals who\n","experience a bout of exercise-induced asthma can undertake subsequent exercise with relative protection from further episodes. Some people with asthma\n","use this strategy to manage exercise-induced symptoms by undertaking a warm-up to exercise of short, high-intensity exercise bursts. The refractory\n","period can be inhibited by anti-inflammatory medications such as indometacin. For most, exercise-induced asthma can be diagnosed on symptoms or wheeze\n","or excess dyspnea during or following exercise, which may be confirmed with peak flow testing. However, in some cases it is important to make a\n","diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma so, in the lung function laboratory or for research purposes, exercise-induced asthma can be brought on by a\n","short period (6-8 minutes) of high-intensity exercise of at least 70% of maximum capacity. Lung function is measured following this exercise; a\n","decline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) of more than 10% from baseline denotes a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma (Figure 8.1).\n","During inhalation air is humidified and warmed to body temperature. At rest, this process usually occurs in the upper airways, particularly in the\n","nose. During exercise, ventilation is increased, sometimes to levels exceeding 100 L/min, so that the individual has to breathe through the mouth to\n","overcome upper airway resistance. Mouth breathing and increased ventilation lead to recruitment of the lower airways to warm and humidify inspired\n","air, resulting in progressive evaporation of airway surface fluid and consequent hyperosmolarity of this fluid. It is thought that hyperosmolarity of\n","the airway surface fluid provokes mast cell degranulation, which can then stimulate airway narrowing through smooth muscle contraction. In support of\n","these theories, exercise-induced asthma has been shown to correlate with increased blood, lavage and urinary mast cell mediators. In addition,\n","breathing humidified warmed air during exercise has been shown to be protective for the development of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Swimming\n","is often recommended as an exercise to people with asthma, as inspiration will occur from the humidified air near the water surface, decreasing the\n","dehydrating stimulus to the lower airways. By contrast, many individuals with asthma find cold air a potent trigger of symptoms. This is because the\n","water content of air is temperature dependent, cold air holding less water than warmer air. Thus, exercise in the cold, such as skiing, requires\n","greater water transfer for complete saturation of inspired air than does exercise in warmer climates, and cold dry air is therefore a more potent\n","stimulus for developing exercise-induced asthma. Exercise-induced symptoms appear to be more common in atopic individuals; this observation may imply\n","that inhaled allergens play a role. In particular, loss of the protective functions of the upper airways during inspiration may permit increased\n","penetration to the lower respiratory tract of allergens and other particles likely to stimulate asthma. Although this has not been proven to be a\n","cause in laboratory-induced exercise-induced asthma, increased lower airway exposure to allergens and extremes of environmental changes such as heat\n","and cold may be particularly relevant in elite athletes who spend a large amount of time training with high ventilation, thereby increasing their\n","cumulative exposure to such potential triggers.\n","\n","Prediction:\n","Exercise-induced asthma.

This process of imaging is fraught with complexity.

Volumetric (3D) imaging can be useful in support of\n","serial tumor measurements, as this provides image reconstructions in all planes. Glioblastoma recurrence versus therapy effects. A problematic issue\n","is the overlap that exists between structural and advanced imaging features of viable tumor and necrotic tissue. On conventional MRI sequences, the\n","early (pseudoprogression; Figure 4.2) and late (radiation necrosis) effects of adjuvant therapy are often indistinguishable from a growing tumor, as\n","both may appear as new or enlarging enhancing lesions due to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The true incidence of therapy effects is debatable,\n","as it depends on the definition of a progressive lesion. This complexity is acknowledged in the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria,\n","which take into consideration the timing of adjuvant therapy for glioblastoma serial monitoring. To date, the challenge of distinguishing between\n","glioblastoma recurrence and therapy effects has not been completely resolved, not least because the two may coexist. However, several advanced imaging\n","techniques are valuable in this context. Perfusion MRI can help to identify neovascular (viable) tumor (Figure 4.3), but difficulty may arise from\n","intermediate values, and short-interval monitoring may be necessary unless a histological diagnosis is pursued. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)\n","may have potential for identifying therapy effects, but it is infrequently used for this indication and there are conflicting data with regards to its\n","accuracy. Diffusion imaging, using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and advanced methods (see page 36), has shown success in lesion follow-\n","up, with tumor typically exhibiting lower diffusivity values than tissue inflammation/necrosis. However, overlap in diffusivity values and movement of\n","tumor structures over time can hamper serial diffusion measurements in clinical practice. PET imaging may also be useful if advanced MRI techniques\n","are unable to provide a clear distinction between recurrent glioblastoma and therapy effects. Other follow-up tests. Routine blood tests are not\n","required, other than for monitoring during chemotherapy, monitoring antiepileptic use (where indicated) and measurement of blood glucose in patients\n","taking steroids (see page 63).

Recognizing predictive factors for severity (see\n","page 38) is important. A family history of acne and scarring should be taken into account when implementing therapy to prevent significant disease.\n","Scarring has been shown to develop with more prolonged disease and the duration of inflammation appears to be relevant.

If this fails and the number of inflammatory lesions increases, the addition of topical antibiotics and/or benzoyl\n","peroxidase (BPO) should be considered (see pages 54-5). In general, 40-80% of patients with non-inflammatory or mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne\n","respond to topical therapy; this minimizes potential adverse effects associated with the use of systemic agents. When designing a topical therapeutic\n","regimen, attention should be given to the specific formulations available. Existing preparations of some topical agents can cause significant local\n","irritation (see page 55), which decreases tolerability and may, therefore, decrease adherence, particularly in teenage boys who are not accustomed to\n","applying creams or lotions to their faces. Management of this and other side effects is discussed in Chapter 5. Moderate acne.\n","\n","Prediction:\n","Choosing the right treatment. In all cases, the choice of a specific agent or agents should depend\n","on the type of acne lesions as well as the presence of scarring and/or psychological disability.\n","Clinicians should seek to achieve maximum efficacy and tolerability with minimum risk of adverse\n","effects. With the exception of early comedonal acne in prepubertal children, it is rare for a\n","patient to present with a single type of acne lesion. For this reason, combination therapy is the\n","mainstay of acne treatment. For example, different topical therapies may be alternated morning and\n","evening, or formulations containing a stable combination of products may be prescribed. Therapeutic\n","agents should be chosen to match the type and severity of lesions observed in each individual\n","patient. Rational use of combination therapy requires consideration of the pathogenic factors\n","involved (see Chapter 2) and an understanding of how the various antiacne agents target one or more\n","of these factors (see Chapters 5 and).

The onset of HF symptoms (Table 5.2) may be acute (typically with pulmonary edema, even with cardiogenic\n","shock) or subacute. Both right and left HF may occur in the context of low output (fatigue, syncope and hypotension), and both right- and left-sided\n","HF usually occur together. Assessment of functional class (see Table 2.1), based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic HF because it is linked\n","to outcome - the annualized mortality in NYHA class IV HF is about 50%, which is four to five times that of class II and twice that of class III. The\n","signs of HF are often subtle. Jugular venous pressure is a sign of intravascular volume overload that is often overlooked (25-58% of cases) (Table\n","5.3). The Framingham criteria for HF are shown in Table 5.4. However, these features are ill-suited to the recognition of HF with preserved ejection\n","fraction, and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has proposed the incorporation of imaging findings in order to facilitate the recognition of HF\n","in patients presenting with exercise intolerance alone (see Table 5.4). Acute heart failure. The initial clinical picture of acute HF reflects the\n","varying degree of impairment of cardiac output and elevation in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (obtained\n","at left and right heart catheterization, respectively).

More specific for acute HF is\n","Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention.\n","Arrhythmias may play a part in both acute and chronic HF. Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself\n","engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement. Atrial arrhythmias contribute to reduced functional\n","capacity, as atrial systole makes an important contribution to stroke volume, especially in the context of LV filling problems and particularly with\n","exercise. Although some patients die from progressive HF, ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF.

Behavioral therapy - the collective name for the various methods and strategies used to bring about changes in\n","lifestyle - is universally credited as being one of the three main pillars of weight management, alongside dietary modification and increased physical\n","activity (Chapters 5 and). Bringing about a change in behavior is an important part of clinical care; the ability to foster such change in patients is\n","fundamental to the skill base of any health professional. Changing patients' habits and attitudes using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is key to\n","long-term obesity management. Classic behavioral interventions for managing obese patients may last months or years, but complex behavioral therapy\n","concepts can be introduced during a normal consultation. In fact, many clinicians do so without realizing, by simply providing good advice in a\n","logical ordered fashion. For example, if the first thing an individual does when arriving home from a stressful day is to eat two biscuits, basic\n","dietary and nutritional advice is simple: stop eating biscuits. Behavioral therapy, on the other hand, suggests how to avoid eating the biscuits: the\n","answer could be simple - don't buy any biscuits; or more complex - avoid the stressful situation that triggered the desire to eat biscuits, which may\n","mean changing jobs, or walking home instead of taking a crowded bus. Other suggestions might include putting the biscuits where they are difficult to\n","reach, or to have healthy snacks readily accessible instead. Alternatively, there may be other ways to unwind: such as having a bath or going for a\n","run. Behavioral therapy produces disappointing results when used alone, but has much more profound effects when used in combination with other\n","modalities. In short-term studies, it has been shown to induce weight loss of 10% or more but this was not sustained in the long term. However, a\n","long-term support program that combines behavioral therapy with regular physical activity and dietary advice can be highly successful in improving\n","adherence to lifestyle changes and sustaining weight loss. 'Stage of change' theory. An individual's likelihood of accepting any lifestyle advice\n","depends on their 'stage of change', which refers to their state of mind and reflects how motivated they are to undergo management for their condition.\n","Before starting treatment it is important to determine which stage the individual is at and to act accordingly; success is unlikely if the wrong\n","approach is made at the wrong time. The six stages are shown in Figure 7.1. Elements of behavioral therapy. Goal setting: the agreement of realistic\n","weight-loss targets, at a realistic rate of improvement. Self-monitoring: increasing self-awareness of eating patterns and physical activity behavior,\n","which is an essential precursor for change. Stimulus control: avoiding situations that lead to harmful behavior, and promoting situations that\n","influence healthy activity. Problem solving: how to avoid social and societal pressures that might result in straying from agreed goals and targets.\n","Cognitive restructuring: identifying and modifying self-defeating thoughts and ideas. Many of these techniques are summarized in Table 7.1. Self-\n","monitoring is a fundamental pillar of CBT; in its most basic form it constitutes a food and activity diary that records. what is eaten. where the food\n","is eaten, and in what circumstances. emotional feelings or triggers involved. levels of activity.

Once the pattern of eating has been established, the diary can be used as part of the treatment plan, by recording progress towards\n","dietary goals. Long-term weight management has been shown to improve when food records are used. Stimulus control. Different stimuli (cues) for\n","eating, only one of which is feeling physically hungry, must first be identified then managed. For example, eating chocolate biscuits on arriving home\n","from work is more likely to be because of stress than hunger; the stimulus control is therefore to remove the biscuit or the stress. External cues\n","include. time (exempli gratia eating because its lunchtime). the presence of food (exempli gratia eating because food is available, or finishing a\n","plateful because it is rude or wasteful not to [this can be a habit deeply ingrained from childhood]). social situations (exempli gratia eating cheese\n","with port because everyone else is). Stimulus control might involve avoiding external cues, for instance taking a different route home that avoids\n","passing the temptation of a fast-food outlet. Controlling eating at the last stage of the chain (id est when one is already looking at the menu in the\n","window) is incredibly difficult, whereas taking action earlier in the chain, when the meal is less tangible, is easier. Avoiding shopping whilst\n","hungry is another example of stimulus control.\n","\n","Prediction:\n","Management: behavioral therapy. Behavioral therapy - the collective name for the various methods and\n","strategies used to bring about changes in lifestyle - is universally credited as being one of the\n","three main pillars of weight management, alongside dietary modification and increased physical\n","activity (Chapters 5 and). Bringing about a change in behavior is an important part of clinical\n","care; the ability to foster such change in patients is fundamental to the skill base of any health\n","professional. Changing patients' habits and attitudes using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is\n","key to long-term obesity management. Classic behavioral interventions for managing obese patients\n","may last months or years, but complex behavioral therapy concepts can be introduced during a normal\n","consultation. In fact, many clinicians do so without realizing, by simply providing good advice in a\n","logical ordered fashion. For example, if the first thing an individual does when arriving home from\n","a stressful day is to eat two biscuits, basic dietary and nutritional advice is simple: stop eating\n","biscuits. Behavioral therapy, on the other hand, suggests how to avoid eating the biscuits: the\n","answer could be simple - don't buy any biscuits; or more complex - avoid the stressful situation\n","that triggered the desire to eat biscuits, which may mean changing jobs, or walking home instead of\n","taking a crowded bus. Other suggestions might include putting the biscuits where they are difficult\n","to reach, or to have healthy snacks readily accessible instead. Alternatively, there may be other\n","ways to unwind: such as having a bath or going for a run. Behavioral therapy is the only way to\n","avoid eating biscuits. The answer could be simple, such as buying the biscuits: the answers could be\n","simple - avoid the biscuits: the alternative is more complex - don't buy some biscuits; or, complex\n","- avoid the\n","\n","Reference:\n","Behavioral therapy, alongside diet and lifestyle advice, is one of the three key components of\n","obesity management. A person's degree of motivation and expectations should be assessed. Techniques\n","include goal setting, self-monitoring and stimulus control. Binge eating disorder and night eating\n","syndrome are specific eating disorders and should be treated accordingly.\n","\n","####################################################################################################\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bKYnUXhvMszX"},"source":["#####
