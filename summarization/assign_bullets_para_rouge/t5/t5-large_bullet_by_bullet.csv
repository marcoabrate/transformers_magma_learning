9781910797631,chp6,"The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods.","Universal versus selected prevention approaches. Although the science of depression prevention is at an early stage, the developing evidence base indicates promising findings, and a systematic review has identified good evidence for prevention among at-risk individuals and those with early features. In general, it seems that although universally directed services are a vital part of delivering health and social care, there are limits to broad-based community education programs. The most efficient and effective approaches for depression prevention may be those that target populations at risk rather than broader approaches. Selective prevention approaches that enhance protective factors using particular psychotherapy approaches appear able to delay the onset of depression in a range of at-risk groups. Current evidence indicates that interventions based on cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are useful approaches. For instance, a Cochrane review () provides promising evidence for the effectiveness of individually delivered support for postnatal women. Intensive home visits by nurses and health visitors and telephone peer support were both found to reduce depression onset when targeted to those at risk. Preventing depression onset in patients with stroke has also been evaluated, and both antidepressant medication and problem-solving approaches have been found to be effective.",2319,"universally directed services are a vital part of delivering health and social care, but there are limits to broad-based community education programs. selective prevention approaches appear able to delay the onset of depression in a range of at-risk groups.",29.268292682926827,28.57142857142857,28.915662650602414,5.0,4.878048780487805,4.938271604938272,12.195121951219512,11.904761904761903,12.048192771084338,53.21477651596069,43.58009099960327

The extent of effect means that prevention should play a larger role in the further reduction of the disease burden of depressive disorders.

There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals., The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. As explained in Chapter 1, an increase in red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate results in enhanced oxygen off-loading into the tissues. Consequently, patients may tolerate moderately severe anemia with few symptoms. When patients have a transfusion, the goal nadir hemoglobin level should also be based on symptoms rather than on a level extrapolated from guidelines used in other anemias.

Nevertheless, because of these lifelong infectious risks, surgery should be avoided altogether or preferably delayed until at least 5 years of age. If splenectomy is needed at an earlier age, the benefits must be balanced against the risk of infection. Vaccination. Since the spleen is the primary site for the production of immunoglobulin M antibodies, which are required for opsonization of encapsulated organisms, vaccination prior to splenectomy is much preferred.

In good health, the body meets the increased oxygen demand produced by exercise by using some of the inspiratory reserve volume of the lungs to increase tidal volume and by increasing respiratory rate (Figure 3.1).

As a result, the lungs become overinflated with air trapped in the alveoli, particularly when the respiratory rate increases. This hyperinflation compromises the use of the inspiratory reserve volume and breathlessness worsens. As the diaphragm flattens when the lungs are overinflated, the accessory muscles of respiration become increasingly important.

9781910797617,chp1,Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time.,"Advances in genetics have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML. Although in-depth understanding of the relationship between a specific genetic mutation and a specific pathophysiological or clinical feature is clear in only a few cases, this is slowly changing. One such example is the association of the PML-RARA fusion gene with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of AML (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The PML-RARA fusion gene is typically detected as a chromosomal rearrangement: t(15;17)(q22;q21). Patients with APL have a high risk for fatal hemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the consequence of a halt in myeloid differentiation that is mediated by the PML-RARA fusion gene. The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development. In normal cells, RARA encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors; PML is important in controlling proliferation and apoptosis, among other processes. The PML-RARA fusion protein suppresses gene transcription and blocks differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage, resulting in the accumulation of malignant promyelocytes seen in APL. Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage.

This may be because affected individuals die before birth, or because cases are mild and do not require medical attention. Alternatively, some cases may not be properly recognized, or they may be misdiagnosed.

It recommends a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all women who are not known to be diabetic at 24-28 weeks.

9781908541420,ch_6,Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy. Increased use of relievers (short-acting beta -agonists) indicates inadequate disease control.,"Inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclometasone (beclomethasone) dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone, fluticasone furoate and ciclesonide, are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents currently available for asthma management. They are the mainstay of effective asthma treatment, improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths. Studies have consistently shown that these agents reduce pathological signs of airway inflammation, so that lung function and symptoms improve, bronchial hyperresponsiveness decreases, and the frequency and severity of exacerbations are reduced. Corticosteroids interrupt the signaling pathways for pro-inflammatory molecules by decreasing the expression of genes for a variety of inflammatory mediators and by increasing the expression of genes for anti-inflammatory mediators. Inhaled corticosteroids are also useful in the treatment of persistent asthma because they reduce the need for oral corticosteroids and have fewer systemic adverse effects. Local adverse effects, which include oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia and coughing, can largely be prevented by using spacer devices and mouth rinsing after use. Potential systemic adverse effects include thinning of the skin, cataract formation, adrenal suppression and decreased bone metabolism and growth. The risk of such effects depends on a number of factors, including the dose taken, absorption from the gut or lung, the extent of first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver, and the half-life of the corticosteroid. In general, the risk of significant systemic effects is low with therapeutic doses.",2531,"inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents for asthma. their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths. local adverse effects include oropharyngeal candidiasis, dysphonia and coughing.",20.689655172413794,26.08695652173913,23.076923076923077,10.714285714285714,13.636363636363635,11.999999999999998,20.689655172413794,26.08695652173913,23.076923076923077,66.20378494262695,22.813022136688232
9781908541420,ch_6,Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks.,"Relievers (sometimes referred to as rescue medication) are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks (see Table 4.2). They include SABAs, LABAs with a rapid onset of action, short-acting theophylline and short-acting anticholinergic agents. The most effective forms are those that are delivered by inhalation directly to the airways. Short-acting beta -agonists. Inhaled SABAs, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, are used to control bronchoconstriction, and are the treatment of choice for the management of acute exacerbations and the prophylaxis of exercise-induced asthma. Oral preparations are also available and may be suitable for patients who are unable to use inhaled medication. In general, oral administration is less desirable than inhaled administration because systemic side effects such as tachycardia are more pronounced when the drug is delivered orally. Concern has been expressed over the long-term safety of repeatedly inhaling short-acting beta -bronchodilators. Several points are worth making in relation to the use of these quick relievers. They are certainly the best drugs for relieving acute bronchospasm and associated symptoms, but their increased use by a patient is a sign of worsening asthma and the need for greater use of controller (preventer) drugs. The use of one canister of a metered-dose inhaler per month should certainly sound alarm bells. Regular use of SABAs is not recommended, as a refractory response may develop, and it has been suggested that asthma may worsen. In addition, it is now known that genetic beta -adrenoceptor polymorphisms influence the effectiveness of these drugs, particularly with regard to tachyphylaxis or the development of refractoriness; therefore SABAs should only be used for quick relief on an 'as-required' basis.",2531,quick relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks. the most effective forms are those that are delivered by inhalation directly to the airways. concern has been expressed over the long-term safety of repeatedly inhaling short-acting beta -bronchodilators.,43.47826086956522,47.61904761904761,45.454545454545446,31.11111111111111,34.146341463414636,32.558139534883715,30.434782608695656,33.33333333333333,31.818181818181824,68.67390275001526,47.68092334270477

While achieving control of asthma symptoms is likely to lead to prevention of exacerbations in most, for some patients asthma exacerbations are the predominant feature of their asthma. As asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening and are inevitably disruptive to patients and their carers, in these instances prevention of exacerbations should be the major focus of treatment. Factors indicating a high risk for future exacerbations include a past history of severe or life-threatening asthma attack, exacerbation occurring despite adequate preventative treatment, impaired interval lung function and cigarette smoke exposure. Current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma treatment, depending on disease control (Table 4.5), in both adults and children (Figure 4.6).

9783318066685,ch4,"After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach.","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes death in infants. Loss of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle wasting, initially affecting arm, leg and respiratory muscles. The disease is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which is autosomal recessive and encodes survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (SMN1), a protein necessary for motor neuron survival. The SMN1 protein is important for the biogenesis and assembly of small nuclear ribonucleic particles (snRNPs), which are critical in messenger (m)RNA splicing (spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing). While SMN1 is ubiquitously expressed, its loss is particularly detrimental to motor neurons. Without functional motor neurons, the central nervous system (CNS) is unable to send signals to skeletal muscles, and babies born with this defect gradually become paralyzed. To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1. This vector is capable of transducing motor neurons and effectively transduces the spinal cord after systemic administration. Moreover, it is also able to cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce cells in the brains of rhesus macaques, even in animals up to 3 years old. Nonetheless, it is thought that the most effective reversal of disease can be achieved early in life. Remarkably, all 15 babies treated by this gene therapy in the initial clinical trial are alive at age 20 months or older (these patients were expected to die within the first 2 years of life). Most can sit up, and some are even able to walk.

Overweight is also associated with increased sympathetic activity, an effect that may be mediated by leptin, a protein expressed in and secreted by adipocytes (see Chapter 2). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has also been causally implicated in obesity-related hypertension, partly because of activation by increased sympathetic activity, and perhaps also because angiotensinogen is expressed in and secreted by adipose tissue. Low levels of the adipocyte-derived cytokine adiponectin, high circulating levels of free fatty acids and increased vascular production of endothelin-1 have also been implicated in mediating the effect of obesity to increase blood pressure, although recent studies have suggested that BMI, in the absence of diabetes, does not affect plasma adiponectin levels.",2556,"renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system causally implicated in obesity-related hypertension. low levels of adipocyte-derived cytokine adiponectin, high circulating levels of free fatty acids have also been implicated in mediating the effect of obesity to increase blood pressure.",7.894736842105263,23.076923076923077,11.76470588235294,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.894736842105263,23.076923076923077,11.76470588235294,58.44494104385376,3.64069901406765
