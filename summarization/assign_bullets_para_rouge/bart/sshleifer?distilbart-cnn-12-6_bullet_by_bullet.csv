9781910797631,chp6,"The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods.","Universal versus selected prevention approaches. Although the science of depression prevention is at an early stage, the developing evidence base indicates promising findings, and a systematic review has identified good evidence for prevention among at-risk individuals and those with early features. In general, it seems that although universally directed services are a vital part of delivering health and social care, there are limits to broad-based community education programs. The most efficient and effective approaches for depression prevention may be those that target populations at risk rather than broader approaches. Selective prevention approaches that enhance protective factors using particular psychotherapy approaches appear able to delay the onset of depression in a range of at-risk groups. Current evidence indicates that interventions based on cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are useful approaches. For instance, a Cochrane review () provides promising evidence for the effectiveness of individually delivered support for postnatal women. Intensive home visits by nurses and health visitors and telephone peer support were both found to reduce depression onset when targeted to those at risk. Preventing depression onset in patients with stroke has also been evaluated, and both antidepressant medication and problem-solving approaches have been found to be effective.",2319, A systematic review has identified good evidence for prevention among at-risk individuals and those with early features.

The extent of effect means that prevention should play a larger role in the further reduction of the disease burden of depressive disorders. Low participation rates in depression prevention programs have been noted as a problem, but it seems likely that the increased use of communications technologies such as mobile phones and the internet, together with appropriate marketing approaches, will enhance involvement. The attention given to improving recognition of depression in primary care explored in Chapter 4 is encouraging. However, a central problem with innovations to improve detection is that they have not necessarily led to more effective depression management.

These management problems relate to the availability, acceptability and effectiveness of current treatments for depression: although considerable progress has been made over recent decades, difficulties and limitations remain in all these areas.

Most smokers accept cough and shortness of breath, so they often dismiss these symptoms of progressive airflow limitation as a normal consequence of their smoking habit and the aging process. Breathlessness is the symptom that causes most disability and is associated with loss of lung function over time. In good health, the body meets the increased oxygen demand produced by exercise by using some of the inspiratory reserve volume of the lungs to increase tidal volume and by increasing respiratory rate (Figure 3.1). In COPD, because the expiratory airflow is reduced, the lungs empty slowly. As a result, the lungs become overinflated with air trapped in the alveoli, particularly when the respiratory rate increases. This hyperinflation compromises the use of the inspiratory reserve volume and breathlessness worsens. As the diaphragm flattens when the lungs are overinflated, the accessory muscles of respiration become increasingly important. The loss of alveolar/capillary surface in COPD, particularly in emphysema, increases the ventilation required to excrete the carbon dioxide that is generated during exercise, and this further increases the sensation of breathlessness.",2370, COPD is a slowly progressive disorder and patients gradually adapt to their disability.

However, because FEV only partially captures the severity of COPD, recent recommendations suggest assessing additional measures. The most recent classification from the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) takes into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation (Figure 3.2). First, the patient's symptoms are assessed using the COPD assessment test (CAT) or the modified MRC score (mMRC) for dyspnea (see Table 3.2). The CAT is the preferred test as it provides a comprehensive assessment of symptoms (www.catestonline.org). A CAT score of 10 or more indicates a high level of symptoms. Exacerbation risk is then assessed in three ways: by the severity of airflow limitation as indicated by spirometry grade, with a GOLD classification of 3 or 4 indicating high risk (see Table 4.1); by the patient's history of exacerbations, with two or more exacerbations in the preceding year indicating high risk; and by the patient's history of hospitalization in the preceding year. The highest risk parameter should be recorded for the purposes of this assessment.

9781910797105,ch08,The dopamine hypothesis remains the major neurochemical hypothesis of schizophrenia.,"In the early 1960s, the Swedish pharmacologist Arvid Carlsson (Figure 8.2) posited the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, in which he stated that schizophrenia was caused by an excess of dopaminergic activity, either an excess of dopamine release and/or hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors. The hypothesis was built on three observations. First was the recognition of a schizophrenia-like psychosis in people who misused amphetamine, a drug known to increase the release of dopamine. Second was the emergence of adverse effects of the recently discovered antipsychotic chlorpromazine, which mimicked Parkinson's disease, itself thought to be due to faulty dopamine transmission. Third was the observation that all effective antipsychotic agents were dopamine receptor antagonists. In the following 15 years, while several experiments provided compelling, but circumstantial, evidence in further support of the importance of the dopamine D receptor in schizophrenia, there remained known shortcomings in the dopamine hypothesis and a lack of direct evidence. In addition, the prediction that untreated patients should have increased numbers of dopamine receptors received no firm support from postmortem assays nor, more critically, from studies using positron emission tomography (PET), which imaged the binding of radiolabeled antipsychotic drugs to receptors.",2422," In the early 1960s, the Swedish pharmacologist Arvid Carlsson posited the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia.

Postmortem studies have documented abnormal NMDA, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptor binding in the prefrontal and temporal cortex, and abnormal NMDA and AMPA messenger RNA receptor expression in the hippocampus. Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from clinical trials that have examined the efficacy of agents that modify the activity of the NMDA receptor. Some, but not all, of these studies have shown that glycine and D-cycloserine, which bind to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, may be effective treatments for negative symptoms. They have also shown that both positive and negative symptoms may be treated by D-serine, which also binds to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, and by sarcosine, which inhibits glycine reuptake.

The treatment approach for migraine is best conceptualized as longitudinal chronic disease management in three parts: preventive measures, abortive treatment and symptom management. This approach is based on understanding the phenomenological pattern of each individual's headache, as in Figure 12.1. First, preventive treatments aim to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of attacks and include daily use of medications such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, alpha -agonists, and beta-blockers (Table 12.4). Second, once prodromal or actual migraine symptoms occur, a stepped-care approach should be taken (Table 12.5). It is important to avoid frequent regular dosing (more than twice weekly) of short-acting analgesics or sedatives such as compounds containing butalbital (a short-acting barbiturate often compounded with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or paracetamol [acetaminophen]), to reduce the incidence of transform (rebound) daily headaches. Psychotherapies, such as support/directive and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), may help patients manage a complex interaction of factors that perpetuate headache.

A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time.,"Advances in genetics have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML. Although in-depth understanding of the relationship between a specific genetic mutation and a specific pathophysiological or clinical feature is clear in only a few cases, this is slowly changing. One such example is the association of the PML-RARA fusion gene with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of AML (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The PML-RARA fusion gene is typically detected as a chromosomal rearrangement: t(15;17)(q22;q21). Patients with APL have a high risk for fatal hemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the consequence of a halt in myeloid differentiation that is mediated by the PML-RARA fusion gene. The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development. In normal cells, RARA encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors; PML is important in controlling proliferation and apoptosis, among other processes. The PML-RARA fusion protein suppresses gene transcription and blocks differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage, resulting in the accumulation of malignant promyelocytes seen in APL. Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage. The complex role of the PML-RARA fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood. Treatment of APL is unique and ultimately capitalizes on these unique pathophysiological findings (though clinical advances preceded genetic understanding in this case; see pages 49-50 for the treatment of APL).",2450," The PML-RARA fusion gene is typically detected as a chromosomal rearrangement: t(15;17)(q22;q21) Patients with APL have a high risk for fatal hemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) The complex role of the PML-Rara fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood.

The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development. In normal cells, RARA encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors; PML is important in controlling proliferation and apoptosis, among other processes. The PML-RARA fusion protein suppresses gene transcription and blocks differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage, resulting in the accumulation of malignant promyelocytes seen in APL. Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage. The complex role of the PML-RARA fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood.

More than 600 cases of PK deficiency have been reported, mainly from Europe, the USA and Japan, but the disease occurs worldwide, and it is likely that many cases go unreported. This may be because affected individuals die before birth, or because cases are mild and do not require medical attention. Alternatively, some cases may not be properly recognized, or they may be misdiagnosed. Given that some cases may not present with any of the findings usually associated with the condition, there are likely to be more cases of PK deficiency than are published in the literature.

They are the mainstay of effective asthma treatment, improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths. Studies have consistently shown that these agents reduce pathological signs of airway inflammation, so that lung function and symptoms improve, bronchial hyperresponsiveness decreases, and the frequency and severity of exacerbations are reduced. Corticosteroids interrupt the signaling pathways for pro-inflammatory molecules by decreasing the expression of genes for a variety of inflammatory mediators and by increasing the expression of genes for anti-inflammatory mediators.",2531," Corticosteroids, such as beclometasone dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate and ciclesonide, are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents currently available for asthma management.",16.666666666666664,17.391304347826086,17.02127659574468,4.3478260869565215,4.545454545454546,4.444444444444444,16.666666666666664,17.391304347826086,17.02127659574468,59.03424024581909,8.820603787899017
9781908541420,ch_6,Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks.,"Relievers (sometimes referred to as rescue medication) are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks (see Table 4.2). They include SABAs, LABAs with a rapid onset of action, short-acting theophylline and short-acting anticholinergic agents. The most effective forms are those that are delivered by inhalation directly to the airways. Short-acting beta -agonists. Inhaled SABAs, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, are used to control bronchoconstriction, and are the treatment of choice for the management of acute exacerbations and the prophylaxis of exercise-induced asthma. Oral preparations are also available and may be suitable for patients who are unable to use inhaled medication. In general, oral administration is less desirable than inhaled administration because systemic side effects such as tachycardia are more pronounced when the drug is delivered orally. Concern has been expressed over the long-term safety of repeatedly inhaling short-acting beta -bronchodilators. Several points are worth making in relation to the use of these quick relievers. They are certainly the best drugs for relieving acute bronchospasm and associated symptoms, but their increased use by a patient is a sign of worsening asthma and the need for greater use of controller (preventer) drugs. The use of one canister of a metered-dose inhaler per month should certainly sound alarm bells. Regular use of SABAs is not recommended, as a refractory response may develop, and it has been suggested that asthma may worsen. In addition, it is now known that genetic beta -adrenoceptor polymorphisms influence the effectiveness of these drugs, particularly with regard to tachyphylaxis or the development of refractoriness; therefore SABAs should only be used for quick relief on an 'as-required' basis.",2531," Inhaled SABAs, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, are used to control bronchoconstriction.

While achieving control of asthma symptoms is likely to lead to prevention of exacerbations in most, for some patients asthma exacerbations are the predominant feature of their asthma. As asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening and are inevitably disruptive to patients and their carers, in these instances prevention of exacerbations should be the major focus of treatment. Factors indicating a high risk for future exacerbations include a past history of severe or life-threatening asthma attack, exacerbation occurring despite adequate preventative treatment, impaired interval lung function and cigarette smoke exposure.

9783318066685,ch4,"After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach.","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes death in infants. Loss of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle wasting, initially affecting arm, leg and respiratory muscles. The disease is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which is autosomal recessive and encodes survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (SMN1), a protein necessary for motor neuron survival. The SMN1 protein is important for the biogenesis and assembly of small nuclear ribonucleic particles (snRNPs), which are critical in messenger (m)RNA splicing (spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing). While SMN1 is ubiquitously expressed, its loss is particularly detrimental to motor neurons. Without functional motor neurons, the central nervous system (CNS) is unable to send signals to skeletal muscles, and babies born with this defect gradually become paralyzed. To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1. This vector is capable of transducing motor neurons and effectively transduces the spinal cord after systemic administration. Moreover, it is also able to cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce cells in the brains of rhesus macaques, even in animals up to 3 years old. Nonetheless, it is thought that the most effective reversal of disease can be achieved early in life. Remarkably, all 15 babies treated by this gene therapy in the initial clinical trial are alive at age 20 months or older (these patients were expected to die within the first 2 years of life). Most can sit up, and some are even able to walk.

9781908541680,ch_4,Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the comorbidity most closely linked with obesity. Weight loss prevents the disease in those at risk and improves glycemic control when it is present.,"The lag phase between the onset of uncomplicated obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m) and the development of diabetes can be 10-12 years. However, the underlying pathological changes are already developing when the patient is overweight, even though outward signs and symptoms may remain undetected, and therefore the possibility of disordered glucose metabolism must be considered and looked for. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease. Moreover, recent data have clearly shown that aggressive early management confers the best chance to prevent, or at the very least substantially delay, both progression of the disease and emergence of cardiovascular and other complications. Once complications are established very tight control is less beneficial.

9781908541680,ch_4,Lipid disorders and hypertension are exacerbated by obesity and add to cardiovascular risk.,"Mechanism of obesity-related hypertension. Increased renal sodium reabsorption and blood volume expansion are central features in the development of obesity-related hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia leads to renal salt retention. Overweight is also associated with increased sympathetic activity, an effect that may be mediated by leptin, a protein expressed in and secreted by adipocytes (see Chapter 2). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has also been causally implicated in obesity-related hypertension, partly because of activation by increased sympathetic activity, and perhaps also because angiotensinogen is expressed in and secreted by adipose tissue. Low levels of the adipocyte-derived cytokine adiponectin, high circulating levels of free fatty acids and increased vascular production of endothelin-1 have also been implicated in mediating the effect of obesity to increase blood pressure, although recent studies have suggested that BMI, in the absence of diabetes, does not affect plasma adiponectin levels.",2556," Increased renal sodium reabsorption and blood volume expansion are central features in the development of obesity-related hypertension.
