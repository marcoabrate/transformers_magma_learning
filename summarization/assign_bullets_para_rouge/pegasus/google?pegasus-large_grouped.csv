9781910797631,chp6,"Universal versus selected prevention approaches. Although the science of depression prevention is at an early stage, the developing evidence base indicates promising findings, and a systematic review has identified good evidence for prevention among at-risk individuals and those with early features. In general, it seems that although universally directed services are a vital part of delivering health and social care, there are limits to broad-based community education programs. The most efficient and effective approaches for depression prevention may be those that target populations at risk rather than broader approaches. Selective prevention approaches that enhance protective factors using particular psychotherapy approaches appear able to delay the onset of depression in a range of at-risk groups. Current evidence indicates that interventions based on cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are useful approaches. For instance, a Cochrane review () provides promising evidence for the effectiveness of individually delivered support for postnatal women. Intensive home visits by nurses and health visitors and telephone peer support were both found to reduce depression onset when targeted to those at risk. Preventing depression onset in patients with stroke has also been evaluated, and both antidepressant medication and problem-solving approaches have been found to be effective. Overall, findings from trials conducted in a range of settings indicate that preventive interventions may reduce the incidence of depressive disorders by around 20% compared with treatment-as-usual control groups. The extent of effect means that prevention should play a larger role in the further reduction of the disease burden of depressive disorders. Low participation rates in depression prevention programs have been noted as a problem, but it seems likely that the increased use of communications technologies such as mobile phones and the internet, together with appropriate marketing approaches, will enhance involvement. The attention given to improving recognition of depression in primary care explored in Chapter 4 is encouraging. However, a central problem with innovations to improve detection is that they have not necessarily led to more effective depression management. It appears that many people who are recognized as being depressed are not provided with appropriate treatment, and many of those prescribed antidepressants discontinue them too soon. These management problems relate to the availability, acceptability and effectiveness of current treatments for depression: although considerable progress has been made over recent decades, difficulties and limitations remain in all these areas. A central issue in relation to depression management is the heterogeneity of this condition. As discussed earlier, depression covers a spectrum of symptoms, and different approaches are appropriate for differing levels and types of presentation. As well as matching different approaches according to severity, a number of different treatments appear to be equally effective for managing depression. People receiving the same treatments show a range of differing responses, with 25-30% of people treated showing no improvement with initial treatment. The clinical benefits of treatment are likely to be incomplete for a substantial proportion of people, with many requiring changes and combinations of treatments. At present around one-third of people achieve only partial remission from symptoms despite treatment.

At present around one-third of people achieve only partial remission from symptoms despite treatment. Psychological approaches using the computer and internet. One of the main barriers to patients receiving appropriate psychological treatments, such as CBT or PST, is a shortage of clinicians who can deliver them. Additionally, there may be problems for individuals scheduling appointments with family, work or carer commitments. Internet-based CBT programs, such as MoodGym and the Sadness Program in Australia, make use of the same techniques as face-to-face therapy but these are delivered in a more accessible and cost-effective way via a website. Evaluations of a range of computer- and internet-based CBT programs indicate significant improvements in the symptoms of depression compared with control patients. There is some indication that improvements in symptoms are maintained over time (up to 12 months). The use of such innovations in delivery may be particularly useful in rural and remote settings where access to clinicians may be limited. Regimen changes. Increasing the dose may be beneficial, but there is limited evidence that exceeding the recommended dose has additional benefit. Alternatively, switching to another medication, either within class when side effects may be the problem, or to another class of antidepressants when the response is limited, can be considered, with choice guided by factors such as previous treatment history and the potential of the drug to cause side effects. Switching between antidepressants because of poor response to initial treatment is more likely to be needed for people with more chronic depression and more coexisting health problems. If there is poor response to these strategies, augmentation with another psychotropic drug such as lithium, a second-generation antipsychotic or another antidepressant may be considered. This is usually undertaken in consultation with a consultant psychiatrist or within a specialist mental health service.","The treatment rather than the prevention of depression has dominated agendas to date. However, better understanding of depression risk factors is enabling the emergence and evaluation of preventive approaches, and there are indications that incidence may be substantially reduced by these methods. For milder forms of depression, self-help, relaxation, sleep hygiene, exercise and problem-solving therapy are likely to be effective; for moderate to severe depression, antidepressants or a structured psychological treatment (cognitive-behavior therapy) is indicated; combined antidepressants and psychological therapy may be most appropriate for severe depression. There are a range of treatments that may be effective for depression, and matching management intensity to the level of depression severity - termed 'stepped care' - is a widely adopted framework for care. Depression is complex, and understanding and helping requires a sensitive weighing up of the many factors that are relevant to the individuals and families affected. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor antidepressants are the first-choice medication but prior treatment history, medical history and drug interactions are key considerations in treatment selection.","Although the science of depression prevention is at an early stage, the developing evidence base indicates promising findings, and a systematic review has identified good evidence for prevention among at-risk individuals and those with early features.

9781910797426,ch03,"Epidemiology and risk factors. Gallstones are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age; women are at higher risk than men. In the USA, 5-8% of men and 13-26% of women have gallstones. Native Americans have the highest prevalence in North America, with more than 70% of Pima Indian women having gallstones; African-Americans have the lowest prevalence. European studies have reported the prevalence of gallstones to be about 10% in men and 20% in women, figures that increase to 30% and 40% respectively in older patients. Other risk factors for gallstones are given in Table 3.1. There are relatively few contraindications to this procedure. They include severe coagulopathy, severe congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; patients with either of the last two conditions may not tolerate the pneumoperitoneum needed for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Previous upper abdominal surgery may make the procedure difficult. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed in patients with well-compensated liver cirrhosis, although there is an increased risk of bleeding in some patients. Conversion to an open operation is needed in about 5% of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies, usually because anatomic landmarks cannot be seen clearly enough. Symptoms and signs include pain or tenderness and guarding in the right upper quadrant, nausea and vomiting, fever, fast pulse (tachycardia) and a positive Murphy's sign (transient cessation of breathing due to pain during inspiration while the right upper quadrant is palpated, but not the left upper quadrant). Complications include empyema, perforation of the gallbladder, liver abscess and emphysematous cholecystitis. An inflamed and distended gallbladder may obstruct the main bile duct by pressure from a gallstone causing obstructive jaundice (Mirizzi's syndrome). Laboratory tests. Leukocytosis and mild elevation in serum bilirubin and transaminases may be present. Transabdominal ultrasonography is the most useful test for acute cholecystitis as it establishes the presence of gallstones (Figure 3.5). A thickened gallbladder wall (> 4 mm) and pericholecystic fluid are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.6). Sonographic Murphy's sign (tenderness over the gallbladder from the ultrasound transducer during imaging) is also diagnostic. Radionuclide scanning is a useful test if ultrasound is non-diagnostic or inconclusive but there is clinical suspicion of acute cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan uses a technetium-labeled analog of iminodiacetic acid. Non-visualization of the gallbladder with visualization of the tracer in the CBD and the small intestine is consistent with cystic duct obstruction. This test is about 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Computed tomography is useful for identifying local complications of acute cholecystitis (Figure 3.7). Medical treatment of acute cholecystitis involves. Epidemiology and risk factors. Acalculous cholecystitis is associated with a myriad of clinical conditions and frequently occurs in critically ill patients, with the incidence in this group ranging from 0.5 to 18%. There are many predisposing risk factors (Table 3.2). Symptoms and signs. The usual scenario consists of abdominal pain, fever and leukocytosis in a patient with one of the above predisposing conditions. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. Right upper quadrant tenderness and Murphy's sign may be present, and a palpable mass may be detected in a minority of patients. Jaundice is not uncommon. Etiology and pathogenesis. Chronic gallbladder inflammation is attributed as an etiologic factor in gallbladder cancer along with molecular alterations in p53 and K-ras. Inflammation may occur as a result of gallstones, gallbladder polyps, chronic Salmonella infection, congenital biliary cysts, abnormal pancreaticobiliary duct junction, carcinogen exposure and certain drugs. There are molecular differences between gallbladder cancers associated with gallstones and those with an abnormal pancreaticobiliary junction. Epidemiology and risk factors. Gallbladder carcinoma is the fifth most common gastrointestinal (GI) cancer in the USA and is the most common GI cancer in Native Americans. Incidence and mortality are very high in certain Latin American countries, especially Chile.","The prevalence of gallstones is greater in people over 40 years of age, and women are at higher risk than men. Patients with gallbladder polyps more than 1 cm in size should be considered for cholecystectomy owing to the increased risk of malignancy. Transabdominal ultrasound is the imaging test of choice, with an accuracy of over 95%, for the diagnosis of gallstones in either acute or chronic cholecystitis. A Tc-HIDA (hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid) scan is 95% accurate for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Acalculous cholecystitis may occur in critically ill patients; the diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion.

9781908541277,ch_12,"Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric condition in patients with epilepsy - up to 55% of patients in some studies - and has a greater negative impact on quality of life than seizure-specific variables such as seizure frequency and severity. Depression is under-recognized and, when diagnosed, often undertreated. Depression associated with epilepsy differs clinically from depressive disorders in non-epileptic patients. Accordingly, symptoms of depression in patients with epilepsy often fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for affective disorders set out in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV).

Clinicians often inadequately treat depression because they are concerned that antidepressant therapy will increase seizure frequency. The consequence of underdiagnosis and undertreatment can be fatal. The overall suicide rate in depressed patients with epilepsy is five times higher than that in the general population and as much as 25 times higher in patients with complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin.

Clinicians should encourage their patients to work whenever possible and to recommend they seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. In the USA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was amended in 2008 to further protect the rights of persons with epilepsy, protects a person from being denied employment because of a medical condition if that person can perform the essential duties of that job. In the UK, in line with several other European countries, a similar Disabilities Discrimination Act was introduced in 1995 to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in employment. Whether patients should disclose their epilepsy before being hired is best dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Driving is often viewed as essential to holding a job and living independently. However, as driving is a privilege, applicants must meet the requirements established by their state, province or country to qualify for a driver's license. With reference to epilepsy, these requirements usually specify a seizure-free interval necessary for driving, the obligations of the patient and the physician to notify the authorities of the patient's status, and allowances that are made under certain circumstances such as seizures that only occur during sleep or seizures that occur during a physician-prescribed AED taper. Clinicians should be thoroughly familiar with the applicable laws where they practice, and should clearly document their discussions with patients. Clinicians should also remember that side effects of AEDs, especially sedation, may interfere with a patient's ability to safely operate a vehicle, and should advise patients accordingly. Life insurance. Patients with epilepsy may be unable to find affordable life insurance, particularly if applying for an individual policy. Most insurance companies ascribe a globally higher risk of mortality to people with seizures, irrespective of the applicant's frequency or severity of seizures. Patients who obtain life insurance through their place of employment generally do not have a problem. Lifestyle considerations. Clinicians should counsel patients on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures and help maintain overall health without unduly limiting activities that bring enjoyment and fulfillment. Reducing or eliminating the consumption of alcohol, engaging in stress-reducing behaviors, eating regularly and getting adequate sleep may help to reduce seizure frequency. Regular aerobic exercise, especially conducted in such a way that having a seizure would not pose a safety risk, is important for general maintenance of health as well as bone health. Participation in organized sports is generally possible, though the possibility of concussion should be minimized and athletes should consider discussing their condition with team trainers and doctors in advance.","Depression and anxiety are common in patients with epilepsy, and have a significantly negative impact on quality of life. The potential benefit of treating depression and anxiety pharmacologically outweighs the risk of increased seizures. Psychosis is uncommon in patients with epilepsy, and generally occurs following a cluster of complex partial seizures. When psychotropic medications and antiepileptic drugs are coadministered, dosages may need to be adjusted because of potential pharmacokinetic interactions. Patients should be encouraged to work whenever possible, and to seek legal help if they encounter discrimination in the workplace. Legal restrictions on driving for people with epilepsy vary; clinicians should be aware of the relevant laws in their place of practice, and must clearly document their discussion with patients. Patients with epilepsy may have difficulty in finding affordable life insurance. Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications that reduce the risk of provoking seizures without unduly limiting activities.","Accordingly, symptoms of depression in patients with epilepsy often fail to meet the diagnostic criteria for affective disorders set out in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV).

9781910797907,chp6,"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequently used to support patients with PK deficiency, particularly during the first months of life. However, transfusion thresholds and guidelines used in other red cell disorders, such as thalassemia major or intermedia, do not necessarily apply to PK deficiency. When to transfuse. There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals., The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. As explained in Chapter 1, an increase in red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate results in enhanced oxygen off-loading into the tissues. Consequently, patients may tolerate moderately severe anemia with few symptoms. When patients have a transfusion, the goal nadir hemoglobin level should also be based on symptoms rather than on a level extrapolated from guidelines used in other anemias. Many patients with PK deficiency will never need a transfusion or will only require intermittent, or unplanned, transfusions during hemolytic crises due to infections or an aplastic crisis associated with parvovirus infection. Others may remain on regular transfusion therapy until splenectomy is considered. The benefits of splenectomy. Before splenectomy, the reticulocyte count may be inappropriately low or mildly to moderately increased (5-15%). After splenectomy, reticulocyte counts can be as high as 50-70% and, with the extended lifespan of PK-deficient reticulocytes in the absence of the spleen, hemoglobin levels increase by a median of 1.6 g/dL. Splenectomy partially ameliorates the anemia in most patients and is beneficial in decreasing the need for transfusions in 90% of patients. In patients who received regular transfusions before splenectomy, approximately 80% can discontinue transfusions altogether following surgery. However, in almost all patients, an incompletely compensated hemolytic process persists, in which mild anemia, reticulocytosis and indirect hyperbilirubinemia continue. Patient selection. Preoperative assessment of red cell survival, splenic sequestration and/or spleen size is of no value in selecting patients for splenectomy. In part, this reflects the importance of the liver as a site of RBCl destruction. Low pre-splenectomy hemoglobin levels are associated with a poorer response to splenectomy in terms of the post-splenectomy hemoglobin rise and/or transfusion burden. The burden of transfusions in PK deficiency varies between patients. The decision whether to have a splenectomy to improve the anemia of PK deficiency is complex and depends on both the physician's and the patient's perspective of the potential benefits and risks. Recent guidelines recommend splenectomy in patients who are reliant on regular transfusions or are severely anemic. Splenectomy should also be considered in patients who receive intermittent transfusions with every infectious illness or who have symptomatic anemia. Post-splenectomy sepsis. Splenectomy increases susceptibility to serious bacterial infections with encapsulated organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Capnocytophaga canimorsus. In the absence of a spleen, individuals are also at risk of severe babesiosis and malaria. With adequate vaccinations and prophylactic antibiotics, the absolute risk of a serious infection is very low. Nevertheless, because of these lifelong infectious risks, surgery should be avoided altogether or preferably delayed until at least 5 years of age. If splenectomy is needed at an earlier age, the benefits must be balanced against the risk of infection. Vaccination. Since the spleen is the primary site for the production of immunoglobulin M antibodies, which are required for opsonization of encapsulated organisms, vaccination prior to splenectomy is much preferred. Vaccination schedules are frequently updated based on new information and vaccine development. Therefore, physicians should refer to an updated website rather than to articles or books for a list and schedule of vaccinations before splenectomy. A useful website is www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/index.html. It is recommended that all vaccines are given at least 2 weeks before splenectomy. Once splenectomized, if an individual has a fever of 38.5°C (101.5°F) or higher, they should be seen urgently for a blood culture and complete blood count and given intravenous or intramuscular broad-spectrum antibiotics. Post-splenectomy thrombosis. Many studies demonstrate an overall increased risk of thrombosis after splenectomy, including in otherwise healthy individuals. After splenectomy, the overall risk of thrombosis in PK deficiency is approximately 10%, including portal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and central nervous system thrombosis. Although the etiology for the increased risk is not clear, some physicians recommend taking low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) after splenectomy, particularly in patients with marked thrombocytosis, to potentially decrease this risk.","The decision for transfusion therapy relates to the patient's tolerance of anemia rather than an arbitrary level of hemoglobin. Some patients with PK deficiency may tolerate a lower level of hemoglobin than those with other anemias due to increased red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. Splenectomy is beneficial in increasing the hemoglobin level and decreasing the need for transfusions in most patients with PK deficiency. The burden of transfusions in pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency is quite variable and depends on both patient and provider factors. Given the potential risks associated with splenectomy, physicians should participate in shared decision making with their patients to determine whether to pursue splenectomy and at what age. The risk of post-splenectomy thrombosis in PK deficiency is similar (approximately 10%) to other non-malignant hematologic conditions.","There is no set standard with regard to transfusions for patients with PK deficiency because the degree of anemia and associated symptoms differ so much between affected individuals., The decision to opt for transfusion therapy is therefore based on a patient's tolerance of anemia rather than on an arbitrary level of hemoglobin.

9781908541277,ch_8,"Dosage. CBZ should be introduced at low doses (100-200 mg daily) with 100-200 mg increments every 3-14 days, depending on the urgency of the situation. Slow introduction facilitates tolerance to its central nervous system (CNS) side effects and allows hepatic auto-induction of CBZ metabolism to take place. The dose can be increased over the first month or two to a maintenance amount that completely controls the seizure disorder. A balance must be achieved in the individual patient between speed of seizure control and acceptance of temporary CNS toxicity. The final dose will depend on the extent to which CBZ induces its own metabolism (Figure 5.1).

The advent of these newer agents has provided many more options in the management of refractory epilepsy, although whether overall outcomes have improved substantially is debatable.","This wider choice of AEDs permits pharmacological treatment to be better matched to the individual patient's circumstances. Sixteen new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been approved for the treatment of epilepsy since the late 1980s.

9781910797006,ch08,"Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly those that result in hospitalization, place a large burden on healthcare resources. It has been estimated that, in an average UK Health Authority with a population of 250 000, there will be 14 200 consultations with a primary care physician and 680 hospital admissions for exacerbations of COPD each year. In the UK, respiratory admissions account for 25% of all acute emergency admissions, and COPD accounts for more than half of these, representing more than 200 000 hospital admissions per year. Recent studies have suggested that up to 50% of patients do not report exacerbations, so the true frequency is much higher than the number of consultations with primary care physicians suggests. Thus, the healthcare burden imposed by exacerbations of COPD is enormous. Annual costs in the USA are estimated at nearly $29.5 billion and $20.4 billion in direct and indirect costs, respectively. The comparable annual figure in the EU is €80 billion in total costs. The main etiologic factors in exacerbations of COPD are thought to be bacterial and viral infections, and air pollutants. Other factors associated with exacerbations of COPD are social deprivation and changes in temperature. However, in around 30% of exacerbations of COPD, no obvious etiologic factor is found. Bacteria. Between 30% and 50% of patients with exacerbations of COPD have a positive sputum culture for bacteria. However, around 20-30% of clinically stable patients also have a positive bacterial culture from sputum. Bronchoscopic protected specimen brush biopsies show that bacteria are present in the lower airways in greater numbers during exacerbations than in the stable clinical state, suggesting infection. The main organisms present in sputum in exacerbations of COPD are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are less common during exacerbations of COPD, but occur with increasing frequency in patients with severe airflow limitation. In some studies, atypical bacterial pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae have been found during exacerbations of COPD. Changes in bacterial strain have also been associated with acute exacerbations. Management at home. Most exacerbations of COPD are treated in primary care; only a minority of patients are admitted to hospital. Bronchodilators. The dose and the frequency of use of bronchodilators are increased in home management of exacerbations of COPD. If not already used, therapy with multiple bronchodilator classes may be added if symptoms are not improving. In the most severe cases, high-dose nebulized bronchodilators can be given on a regular or as-required basis for several days. However, there is evidence that the use of multiple doses of bronchodilators by metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device has an effect similar to that of nebulized bronchodilators in exacerbations of COPD. When a nebulizer is used, it is probably safer to use air as the driving gas, rather than oxygen, and to continue oxygen therapy via nasal prongs. The long-term use of nebulized therapy after acute exacerbations of COPD is not routinely recommended. Bronchodilators.

The long-term use of nebulized therapy after acute exacerbations of COPD is not routinely recommended. Glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve lung function effectively in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD. Currently, systemic corticosteroid, 40 mg/day for 5 days, is recommended for all patients with an acute exacerbation in the absence of significant contraindications. Oral corticosteroids are preferable. Nebulized budesonide is an alternative to oral corticosteroid treatment in exacerbations without respiratory failure and is associated with a reduction in complications, such as hyperglycemia. Corticosteroids should be discontinued after the acute episode; clinical improvement with corticosteroids during the exacerbation does not indicate the need for long-term treatment with oral or inhaled corticosteroids.","Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and place a huge burden on healthcare resources. The main etiologic factors in acute exacerbations are bacterial infection, respiratory viruses and air pollution. Most exacerbations of COPD are managed at home, but those with suspected respiratory failure should be admitted to hospital. Treatment includes oxygen, increased use of bronchodilators, antibiotics and short-term oral glucocorticosteroids. Exacerbations can be prevented by inhaled corticosteroids and vaccination against influenza. Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure.","It has been estimated that, in an average UK Health Authority with a population of 250 000, there will be 14 200 consultations with a primary care physician and 680 hospital admissions for exacerbations of COPD each year.

MRI studies confirmed the previous findings of enlarged ventricles, with patients exhibiting about a one-third increase in ventricular volume compared with controls (Figure 6.1), and increased sulcal widening (Figure 6.2). MRI studies demonstrated for the first time the involvement of cortical and subcortical gray matter structures. Specifically, people with schizophrenia were shown to exhibit decreased volume of the neocortex, by about 5%, with specific gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. These brain regions are the neuroanatomic substrate for the complex cognitive behaviors that are disrupted in schizophrenia. In addition to volume reductions in these areas, several studies have found that people with schizophrenia have a reversal or loss of the normal asymmetry of these structures. Morphological findings.

These brain regions are the neuroanatomic substrate for the complex cognitive behaviors that are disrupted in schizophrenia. In addition to volume reductions in these areas, several studies have found that people with schizophrenia have a reversal or loss of the normal asymmetry of these structures. MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of limbic system structures such as the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampus (Figure 6.3). These structures are involved in the regulation of emotions and various forms of memory. The magnitude of these changes is relatively small (Table 6.1), but the observations have been shown to be highly reliable, especially for the hippocampus. MRI studies have also documented decreased volume of specific thalamic nuclei and total volume of the thalamus. Thalamic nuclei play a central role in gating the flow of information to the cerebral cortex and in regulating the activation of specific cortical brain areas in response to external or internal stimuli or signals. These MRI results are consistent with postmortem study reports documenting decreased volume of the medial dorsal and pulvinar thalamic nuclei. Progression of brain changes. A series of longitudinal studies involving multiple MRI has evaluated whether schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder, with fixed morphological abnormalities, or a neurodegenerative disorder, with progressive changes in brain structure. These studies, conducted in childhood-onset, first-episode and chronic patient populations, have consistently demonstrated 2-10% decreases in cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes and 5-10% increases in ventricular volume. The extent to which these results apply to a subgroup or to the total schizophrenia population is unknown. The possible progression of brain changes would be consistent with increased functional disability and cognitive decrements observed in a proportion of people with schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown consistently that superior and medial frontal structural changes occur in young people at clinical high risk if they make the transition to full psychosis compared with those who do not. Morphological changes associated with specific symptoms. Several studies have observed an association between decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) gray matter and hallucinations and delusions or positive formal thought disorder. Hallucinations and delusions are more frequently associated with decreased volume of the anterior STG, and positive formal thought disorder with decreased volume of the posterior STG. MRI has also been used to show that people with schizophrenia have a loss of the normal asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres, especially of the planum temporale, a region of the brain involved in audition and language. These observations have led to the development of etiologic hypotheses concerning abnormalities in the normal process of brain lateralization. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on the diffusion of water through different brain tissues and allows for the evaluation of white matter integrity. In addition, DTI may be used to identify and measure specific white matter fiber tracts (Figure 6.4). DTI studies have documented widespread reductions in fractional anisotropy (a measure of white matter integrity) in the white matter of people with schizophrenia, but the localization of the abnormalities has differed across studies. In addition, multiple fiber tracts have been shown to be characterized by reduced fractional anisotropy. Several studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia with persistent negative symptoms have decreased fractional anisotropy in fiber tracts associated with social cognition. In combination with functional imaging, genetic and postmortem studies, DTI studies support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is a dysconnection syndrome, characterized by abnormal connectivity among the different cortical and subcortical brain regions.","People with schizophrenia exhibit gray matter reductions in the prefrontal, superior temporal and inferior parietal heteromodal cortices. Men with schizophrenia have been found to have greater volume reductions in the temporal lobes than women. People with schizophrenia have decreased volume of subcortical structures, including the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampus and thalamus. A subgroup of patients may exhibit progressive changes in brain structure over the course of their illness. Hallucinations, delusions and positive formal thought disorder are associated with decreased volume of the superior temporal gyrus.

9783318068207,hh-5,"The recent improvements in terms of available technologies and bioinformatics tools have allowed a better understanding of the pathobiology of different tumor types and the identification of several genomic alterations that may be targetable.

Fusions and splice variants. RNA-based molecular approaches, such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), NGS and multiplex digital color-coded barcode technology, play a key role in identifying targetable gene fusions (Figure 3.3). These are chimeric genes generated from the fusion of two different genes belonging to the same or different chromosomes. pairs of probes (reporter probe and capture probe), designed to be adjacent to one another along the target sequence of a transcript, are hybridized with mRNAs. excess probes are removed and the hybridized complex is bound to the surface of the sample cartridge. the probe/target complexes are aligned on the cartridge by an electric current and immobilized for data collection. the sample cartridge is scanned by a digital analyzer, and each color code is counted and tabulated. The nCounter system has a number of limitations, however. In particular, results generated by reading the color-coded barcodes are not directly usable for clinical purposes. Thus, additional data processing is required. Furthermore, careful attention needs to be paid to the design of the probe to avoid false-positive results.","Comprehensive genomic profiles offer a complete evaluation of the genomic landscape of each tumor.

9781910797105,ch04,"The most straightforward studies in population genetics are family studies. Usually, a series of individuals with schizophrenia, known as probands or index cases, is selected and rates of schizophrenia are assessed in their biological families. These rates are compared with rates in the families of control probands, usually healthy volunteers. To express the results as rates, the number of affected relatives is divided by the total number and is age-corrected for relatives who are too young to have the disorder or are not yet through the age range at highest risk. Studies in twins involve probands with schizophrenia who are either identical (monozygotic: MZ) or non-identical (dizygotic: DZ). MZ twins share 100% of their genes and DZ twins share about 50%. Concordance rates in the two types of twins are compared by looking at the rate at which co-twins also have schizophrenia. The consensus from population-based studies is that concordance rates are about 45% for MZ co-twins and 15% for DZ co-twins. The fact that concordance is less than 100% in MZ twins suggests that non-genetic, environmental factors are also involved. However, the offspring of the unaffected MZ co-twins in discordant pairs are at increased risk of schizophrenia, suggesting that the co-twins still carry a genetic predisposition for the disease. Most of the genes found by genome-wide association studies to be implicated in schizophrenia do seem plausible in that they are known to exert effects on neuronal systems and particularly synaptic function. It appears too that different genes give different symptom profiles; for example, ZNF804A is associated with better cognition, NRG1 with preserved affect and the dysbindin gene (DTNBP1) with IQ. Examples are being uncovered of synergistic gene-gene interactions, and of how specific genes interact with specific environmental risk factors (Table 4.4). Studies looking at patterns of gene expression in the postmortem brain suggest changes in particular functional gene groups in schizophrenia, such as those related to oligodendrocyte and myelin development and synaptic transmission. It is only since 2008 that the significance of CNVs for neuropsychiatry has been realized. They are usually, but not always, sporadic (arising de novo) duplications or deletions of stretches of DNA several thousand to a million base pairs long. They exist in everyone, at all locations in the genome, and may or may not be passed on. Rates of CNVs have been shown to be higher in schizophrenia as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism (Table 4.5). It is thought that approximately 2% of people with schizophrenia have CNVs. Some CNVs for schizophrenia are associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders; for example, duplications at 15q13.3 are also the region for the commonest duplications in autism and Prader-Willi syndrome.

9781910797006,ch03,"The characteristic symptom of COPD is breathlessness on exertion, sometimes accompanied by wheeze and cough, which is often, but not invariably, productive. Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly` causes the patient to seek medical attention, and it is usually the most disabling. Patients often date the onset of their illness from an episode of worsening cough with sputum production, which leaves them with a degree of chronic breathlessness. However, close questioning will often reveal the presence of a 'smoker's cough' over a period of years, along with the production of small amounts (usually < 60 mL/day) of mucoid sputum, usually predominantly in the morning. Most patients (80%) with COPD will have a smoking history of at least 20 pack-years (1 pack-year is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes [1 pack] per day for 1 year or 10 a day for 2 years) before symptoms are recognized, commonly in the fifth decade. However, COPD may occur in the non-smoker and is more frequently missed in this setting. It is characteristic of patients with COPD to progress through the clinical stages of mild, moderate and severe disease. Symptoms and signs therefore vary in any individual depending on the stage of the disease. Considerable loss of lung function can occur before symptoms become apparent, and many patients may seek medical attention when the disease is at an advanced stage, since COPD is a slowly progressive disorder and patients gradually adapt their lives to their disability. Most smokers accept cough and shortness of breath, so they often dismiss these symptoms of progressive airflow limitation as a normal consequence of their smoking habit and the aging process. The characteristic symptom of COPD is breathlessness on exertion, sometimes accompanied by wheeze and cough, which is often, but not invariably, productive. Breathlessness is the symptom that commonly` causes the patient to seek medical attention, and it is usually the most disabling. Patients often date the onset of their illness from an episode of worsening cough with sputum production, which leaves them with a degree of chronic breathlessness. However, close questioning will often reveal the presence of a 'smoker's cough' over a period of years, along with the production of small amounts (usually < 60 mL/day) of mucoid sputum, usually predominantly in the morning. Breathlessness is the symptom that causes most disability and is associated with loss of lung function over time. In good health, the body meets the increased oxygen demand produced by exercise by using some of the inspiratory reserve volume of the lungs to increase tidal volume and by increasing respiratory rate (Figure 3.1). In COPD, because the expiratory airflow is reduced, the lungs empty slowly. As a result, the lungs become overinflated with air trapped in the alveoli, particularly when the respiratory rate increases. This hyperinflation compromises the use of the inspiratory reserve volume and breathlessness worsens. As the diaphragm flattens when the lungs are overinflated, the accessory muscles of respiration become increasingly important. The loss of alveolar/capillary surface in COPD, particularly in emphysema, increases the ventilation required to excrete the carbon dioxide that is generated during exercise, and this further increases the sensation of breathlessness. The perception of breathlessness varies greatly between individuals with the same degree of ventilatory capacity. Breathlessness can be assessed using the modified Borg Scale (Table 3.1), a visual analog scale, the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale (Table 3.2), or the Dyspnea-12 scale. Mood is an important determinant of the perception of breathlessness in patients with COPD. When the FEV has fallen to 30% or less of the predicted value (equivalent in an average man to an FEV of around 1 liter), breathlessness is usually present on minimal exertion. Severe breathlessness is often affected by changes in temperature and by exposure to dust and fumes. Position has a variable effect on breathlessness. Some patients have severe orthopnea, relieved by leaning forward, whereas others find the greatest ease when lying flat. Wheeze is common in COPD, but is not universally present and is a non-specific symptom. It is not easy to evaluate because of its intermittent nature and the difficulties patients experience in understanding this symptom. Wheeze is due to turbulent airflow through the larger airways as a result of various causes including bronchial smooth muscle contraction, structural airway narrowing and the presence of excess airway secretions. Wheeze does not usually wake patients with COPD at night as it does those with asthma. The absence of signs of wheeze on auscultation of the chest does not exclude a diagnosis of COPD. Many smokers accept the development of exertional dyspnea and cough with sputum production as an inevitable consequence of the smoking habit, and therefore often present to their doctor when the disease is at a fairly advanced stage. Relatively few patients are diagnosed early in the course of the disease. All smokers should quit. However, repeated spirometry over the course of several years will identify smokers with a rapid decline in FEV whose function may still be normal, who could be targeted for smoking cessation and early therapeutic intervention. Traditionally, COPD is regarded as a disease of the lungs characterized by progressive symptoms and a decline in lung function. Therapeutic strategies such as bronchodilators and inhaled glucocorticosteroids have therefore been used for relieving symptoms in association with improving airflow limitation. However, COPD is also associated with a number of systemic effects and common comorbidities (see Table 3.3), which may be present at any stage of the disease. Some of these comorbidities arise independent of COPD, whereas others appear to be causally related, either as a result of shared risk factors or the influence of COPD on the development of another condition. Systemic inflammation in COPD may be the link between COPD and some of its comorbidities. Many national and international guidelines for COPD have used a simple classification of disease severity based on spirometry. However, because FEV only partially captures the severity of COPD, recent recommendations suggest assessing additional measures. The most recent classification from the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) takes into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation (Figure 3.2). First, the patient's symptoms are assessed using the COPD assessment test (CAT) or the modified MRC score (mMRC) for dyspnea (see Table 3.2). The CAT is the preferred test as it provides a comprehensive assessment of symptoms (www.catestonline.org). A CAT score of 10 or more indicates a high level of symptoms. Exacerbation risk is then assessed in three ways: by the severity of airflow limitation as indicated by spirometry grade, with a GOLD classification of 3 or 4 indicating high risk (see Table 4.1); by the patient's history of exacerbations, with two or more exacerbations in the preceding year indicating high risk; and by the patient's history of hospitalization in the preceding year. The highest risk parameter should be recorded for the purposes of this assessment. Alternatively, the COPD Foundation Guide recommends assessing seven independent domains of severity (Table 3.4).","Usually (in 80% of patients) there is a significant smoking history of at least 20 pack-years. For those with lesser smoking histories or for younger individuals, consider an alternative diagnosis or a genetic predisposition (exempli gratia alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency). The most common symptom in COPD is breathlessness on exertion. Clinical indicators include signs of overinflation, prominent use of accessory muscles of respiration, weight loss, expiratory wheeze, cyanosis, peripheral edema and raised jugular venous pressure. These are usually apparent only in severe disease. Dyspnea may be discounted by patients until disease is severe, as breathlessness can be avoided by restricting activity. COPD occurs, though less commonly, in those who do not smoke. Physical signs often present only at an advanced stage of the disease. The systemic effects of COPD result in a number of comorbidities that impact on the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The full spectrum of COPD can now be better identified using new classifications of disease that take into account symptoms and exacerbation risk in addition to airflow limitation.","Considerable loss of lung function can occur before symptoms become apparent, and many patients may seek medical attention when the disease is at an advanced stage, since COPD is a slowly progressive disorder and patients gradually adapt their lives to their disability. Patients often date the onset of their illness from an episode of worsening cough with sputum production, which leaves them with a degree of chronic breathlessness. As a result, the lungs become overinflated with air trapped in the alveoli, particularly when the respiratory rate increases. Mood is an important determinant of the perception of breathlessness in patients with COPD. Wheeze does not usually wake patients with COPD at night as it does those with asthma. However, repeated spirometry over the course of several years will identify smokers with a rapid decline in FEV whose function may still be normal, who could be targeted for smoking cessation and early therapeutic intervention. However, COPD is also associated with a number of systemic effects and common comorbidities (see Table 3.3), which may be present at any stage of the disease. First, the patient's symptoms are assessed using the COPD assessment test (CAT) or the modified MRC score (mMRC) for dyspnea (see Table 3.2). Exacerbation risk is then assessed in three ways: by the severity of airflow limitation as indicated by spirometry grade, with a GOLD classification of 3 or 4 indicating high risk (see Table 4.1); by the patient's history of exacerbations, with two or more exacerbations in the preceding year indicating high risk; and by his history of hospitalization in the preceding year.",32.83582089552239,50.86705202312138,39.909297052154194,7.116104868913857,11.046511627906977,8.656036446469248,13.059701492537313,20.23121387283237,15.873015873015872,63.22063207626343,93.59946250915527
9781908541406,ch_6,"Defects in platelet storage organelles or granules. One form of platelet storage pool disease is due to the absence of dense bodies, which are organelles containing ADP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), calcium and serotonin. Patients exhibit excessive bruising and bleeding after surgery or trauma as the platelets may fail to exhibit a secondary wave of aggregation in response to a variety of aggregating agents. The absence of dense bodies in the platelets can be demonstrated by electron microscopy or by measuring the intraplatelet levels of ADP and ATP. In some patients, this form of storage pool disease is inherited together with tyrosinase-positive oculocutaneous albinism and ceroid pigment deposition in various organs, including the kidney. This constellation is termed the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and is due to mutations in HPS1-8, genes affecting organelle biosynthesis and protein trafficking. Another form of storage pool disease, the gray platelet syndrome, is characterized by a lack of platelet alpha-granules and absence of platelet fibrinogen, fibronectin and thrombospondin. Dysfunction of cytosolic enzymes and other platelet constituents. Cyclooxygenase defects result in impaired platelet aggregation and release of ADP from dense granules in response to ADP and collagen, and are associated with a mild bleeding tendency. As acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) inhibits cyclooxygenase and gives rise to similar clinical and laboratory features, cyclooxygenase deficiency is sometimes known as an 'aspirin-like defect'. A variety of other forms of inherited platelet dysfunction have been described; examples are platelet-type von Willebrand disease, collagen receptor deficiency and the Chediak-Higashi and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes.

Another form of storage pool disease, the gray platelet syndrome, is characterized by a lack of platelet alpha-granules and absence of platelet fibrinogen, fibronectin and thrombospondin. Management. Patients with inherited platelet function defects should avoid ASA (aspirin) and other drugs that alter platelet function. In addition, chronic blood loss may necessitate iron supplementation. Women usually require hormonal therapy to control menorrhagia. Patients should carry documentation describing the nature of their bleeding defect with them at all times. Some of the inherited platelet disorders, such as the gray platelet syndrome, may respond temporarily to treatment with desmopressin. If platelet transfusions are needed, single-donor platelets are usually preferred. Patients with Glanzmann syndrome often become refractory to platelets because they develop anti-alphaIIbbeta3 and also anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. Registries indicate that hemostasis has been secured in some of these patients with recombinant human factor (F)VIIa. The American Society of Hematology's 2011 evidence-based guidelines do not recommend a bone marrow examination in patients newly diagnosed with primary immune thrombocytopenia, provided the history and physical examination are unremarkable and the blood count shows only thrombocytopenia and/or findings of iron deficiency. However, all patients should be tested for hepatitis C and HIV. Treatment. If the platelet count is greater than 50 x 10 /L, no treatment is required and patients may simply be observed at regular intervals. In children, primary immune thrombocytopenia is usually an acute self-limiting condition and, provided there is no frank or persistent bleeding, drug therapy may not be necessary. In adults, however, the thrombocytopenia may be more prolonged and specific treatment may be required. Table 4.5 shows some of the agents used for the management of symptomatic primary immune thrombocytopenia. Steroids. If the platelet count is less than 30 x 10 /L or there is bleeding, prednisone (prednisolone), 1 mg/kg, is given. Patients with platelet counts of less than 20 x 10 /L are generally hospitalized; if there is considerable bleeding, methylprednisolone may be given intravenously. Once the platelet count has increased to over 30 x 10 /L, the dose of corticosteroid is tapered slowly to avoid a rapid relapse. The goal is to prevent recurrence of bleeding by maintaining the platelet count above 20 x 10 /L. If the dose of corticosteroid required to accomplish this is greater than 10-20 mg/day, other interventions, such as those listed below, may be required. Although a rise in the platelet count with oral steroids may not be observed for 5-7 days, bleeding often subsides within a day or two. Some physicians prescribe intravenous immunoglobulin, in addition to corticosteroids, to increase the platelet count more rapidly if there is significant or high potential for serious bleeding.","Inhibitors of platelet function, such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, aspirin), should be avoided in individuals with disorders of platelet function and those with thrombocytopenia. Platelet transfusion has limited indications and should be used sparingly, because it may transmit infection or sensitize the recipient to platelet antigens. Thrombocytopenia may occur with some inherited disorders of platelet function, such as the Bernard-Soulier, gray platelet and Wiskott-Aldrich syndromes. Gestational thrombocytopenia is common and requires no treatment, but it must be distinguished from primary immune thrombocytopenia. In immune thrombocytopenia, bleeding is uncommon if the platelet count exceeds 10 x 10 /L and aggressive interventions (exempli gratia high-dose corticosteroids, splenectomy) are not usually indicated.","One form of platelet storage pool disease is due to the absence of dense bodies, which are organelles containing ADP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), calcium and serotonin.

9781908541277,ch_6,"Epilepsy is not a single disease but an extensive collection of conditions with a wide range of underlying etiologies and pathologies, all sharing the common and fundamental characteristic of recurrent, usually unprovoked, seizures. Figure 3.1 shows some common etiologies in relation to age. A wide range of conditions can mimic epileptic seizures and must be considered in the differential diagnosis (Table 3.1). For example, syncopal attacks, sometimes with clonic movements and incontinence, are commonly misdiagnosed as epileptic seizures. Furthermore, non-epileptic psychogenic seizures (also called pseudoseizures) are estimated to occur in up to 45% of patients referred to specialist centers with apparently refractory epilepsy. This misidentification of non-epileptic conditions as epilepsy can lead to unnecessary treatments that are potentially harmful, and can delay the start of appropriate therapy. The temptation to attach a label of 'epilepsy' should be resisted if there is any doubt about the diagnosis despite a thorough evaluation. Both the physician and patient must simply await the passage of time before coming to a firm conclusion. Further challenges of diagnosis and management may arise in patients in whom non-epileptic events coexist with epileptic seizures or develop as a substitute for epileptic seizures once the epilepsy is controlled. Despite advances in investigational technologies, the diagnosis of epilepsy remains essentially clinical, and is based on a detailed description of the events experienced by the patient before, during and after a seizure. A witness's account of one or more of the episodes is an essential component of a confident diagnosis (Table 3.2).In addition to a full medical and social history, the patient should be asked about factors that may precipitate seizures by lowering the threshold for such an event (Table 3.3). Electroencephalography can support the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and help with the classification of partial-onset or generalized seizures. It is important to give the electroencephalographer detailed information concerning the patient's age, seizure behavior and response to AEDs. Routine EEGs are often insensitive - more than 50% of patients with epilepsy will have a normal trace. Activation techniques, including hyperventilation and photic stimulation (Figure 3.2),are helpful in uncovering abnormalities. Diagnostic yield can also be increased by repeat recordings. If the initial EEG is unremarkable and the diagnosis remains in doubt, a sleep-deprivation study is recommended. Structural imaging. Imaging studies of the brain to look for underlying structural abnormalities are essential for the appropriate diagnostic evaluation of most patients with epilepsy, particularly those presenting with partial-onset seizures. The imaging modality of choice is MRI. It has higher sensitivity and specificity than CT for identifying structural lesions such as malformations of cortical development (Figure 3.3a), hippocampal sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangioma (Figure 3.3b) and low-grade gliomas (Figure 3.3c). CT should be performed if MRI is unavailable and in patients for whom MRI is contraindicated (exempli gratia those with cardiac pacemakers, non-compatible aneurysm clips or severe claustrophobia).

Functional imaging can identify focal abnormalities in cerebral physiology even when structural imaging results are normal. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate increased blood flow in brain regions in association with seizure activity. Epileptogenic areas can be detected as hypometabolic regions interictally by positron emission tomography (Figure 3.4). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can measure changes in chemical compounds in the brain associated with neuronal loss in certain epileptogenic pathologies.

9781910797815,chp3,"The MPNs vary markedly in morphologic and clinical features (Table 3.1). Thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis are major diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV), respectively. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has a more variable presentation, which may include all the features of PV and ET; however, anemia is a common finding and work-up requires the differential diagnosis of anemia. Furthermore, PMF is generally associated with the most severe symptom burden among the MPNs, although patients with PV or ET often also have significant disease-related symptoms (see Table 3.1). The World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for MPNs (Tables 3.2 - 3.4) are based on peripheral blood counts, molecular abnormalities and alterations in bone marrow morphology, reflecting the central role of erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis in the pathophysiology of these conditions. The 2016 updated WHO criteria differ from the 2008 criteria in the following ways. Thrombocytosis is a major criterion for the diagnosis of ET (Table 3.2) but can also be present in other MPNs; the diagnostic approach to ET therefore generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. As shown in Figure 3.1, a patient with elevated platelet count (>= 450 x 10 /L) should undergo further blood testing, including a complete blood count, blood film/smear and determination of iron and C-reactive protein status, together with testing for MPN driver mutations and BCR-ABL1. The presence of a driver mutation might suggest a diagnosis of ET but bone marrow biopsy is required to preclude other MPNs such as PV, PMF or myelodysplastic syndrome. Thrombocytosis is a major criterion for the diagnosis of ET (Table 3.2) but can also be present in other MPNs; the diagnostic approach to ET therefore generally involves the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis. As shown in Figure 3.1, a patient with elevated platelet count (>= 450 x 10 /L) should undergo further blood testing, including a complete blood count, blood film/smear and determination of iron and C-reactive protein status, together with testing for MPN driver mutations and BCR-ABL1. The presence of a driver mutation might suggest a diagnosis of ET but bone marrow biopsy is required to preclude other MPNs such as PV, PMF or myelodysplastic syndrome. Diagnosis of polycythemia vera. In contrast to ET, PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, although some increase in hemoglobin levels may also be seen in JAK2 V617F ET and PMF. The WHO criteria for the diagnosis of PV are shown in Table 3.3 and an algorithm for the differential diagnosis in Figure 3.2.

As noted above, the presentation of PMF is more variable than that of ET or PV, and may include. symptomatic splenomegaly. constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and pruritus. thrombosis or bleeding. In addition to the risks of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to AML, the MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life. For example, an internet-based survey found that almost all of 1179 patients with myeloproliferative disorders reported some constitutional symptoms (Figure 3.4). The most common was fatigue, reported by 81% of patients, followed by pruritus (52%) and night sweats (49%). Furthermore, many patients reported decreased functioning, and 14% reported being disabled. With the exception of spleen pain, each of these symptoms was significantly more common in patients with PV or PMF than in those with ET. Constitutional symptoms in patients with MPNs have a number of causes, including. Importantly, novel therapies such as Janus kinase inhibitors and inhibitors of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) are effective in relieving the symptom burden in MPNs, in addition to reducing cytopenias and spleen size. Assessment of symptoms is therefore an essential aspect of treatment monitoring. Risk stratification. Patients with MPNs are at risk of vascular complications such as hemorrhage and venous or arterial thrombosis. Moreover, PV (and ET to a lesser extent) has a risk of progression to secondary myelofibrosis, while PMF may progress to an AML-like blast phase, which may be preceded by a myelodysplastic phase. The extent to which an individual patient is at risk of vascular complications and disease progression is determined by multiple clinical and molecular risk factors (Table 3.5). Since the level of risk influences treatment decisions, risk stratification is essential in the management of MPNs. ET is usually considered to have the best prognosis among the MPNs. Risk stratification focuses on the likelihood of thrombotic complications, and is based on the two main risk factors for thrombosis: age 60 years or older, and a previous thrombotic event. To date, two prognostic scoring systems have been developed for use in patients with ET.","The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are based on abnormalities of peripheral blood counts and alterations in bone marrow morphology.

In addition to the risk of thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia, MPNs impose a significant symptomatic burden that can markedly impair patients' quality of life. An individual patient's risk of vascular complications and disease progression depends on multiple clinical and molecular risk factors. Since the level of risk will influence treatment decisions, effective risk stratification is essential for effective management of MPNs.

Surgical advances have enabled 'distance from the carina' to be removed from the new TNM classification. However, the poor prognosis associated with pleural invasion has been confirmed, and therefore it remains a contraindication to surgery. Nodal status (N). A fundamental prerequisite in selecting patients for surgical treatment is reliable nodal staging (Table 3.2). The current N classification of nodal staging adequately predicts prognosis, so no change to the N descriptors has been recommended in the eighth edition. Division of the N1 stage into N1a (N1 at a single station) and N1b (N1 at multiple stations), and division of the N2 stage into N2a1 (N2 at a single station without N1 involvement; 'skip' metastasis), N2a2 (N2 at a single station with N1 involvement) and N2b (N2 at multiple stations) is descriptive only, as the survival curves for N1b and N2a2 overlap. Although N2a1 was associated with a better prognosis than N1b, the difference was not significant. Metastasis (M). When patients were assessed according to the number of metastases, there were no significant differences in prognosis in patients with M1a staging (metastases within the chest cavity); however, patients with M1b tumors (distant metastases outside the chest cavity) with a single metastasis in a single organ had a significantly better prognosis than those with multiple metastases in one or several organs. This will now be the definition of M1b and will serve as a first step in providing rational selection criteria for surgical treatment of oligometastatic disease in clinical trials. There will also be a new M1c classification (Table 3.3) - multiple metastases in a single organ or in multiple organs. Ground glass opacity (GGO) is a pulmonary shadow visualized using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), comprised of hazy increased attenuation with preservation of the bronchial and vascular margins. Adenocarcinoma is the most common cause of GGO, therefore careful evaluation for pulmonary malignancy must be considered when GGO is identified. Patients with multiple tumors and a prominent ground glass component on imaging or lepidic component on microscopy are being seen with increasing frequency. These tumors are associated with good survival after resection and have a lower propensity for nodal and extrathoracic spread than other types of NSCLC; however, they frequently relapse. Sublobar resection with the goal of sparing lung parenchyma is the gold standard for treatment of small GGO. The main difficulty is localizing the tumor within the lung during minimally invasive surgery. Different means of tracking the GGO and guiding the resection have been studied, including ink injection, coil insertion, and indocianide green injection.","Better subclassification of early-stage NSCLC according to the size of the tumor will allow trials to compare wedge resection and segmentectomy. Some locally advanced lung cancers benefit from multimodality therapy, which can include surgery. New M1c staging for multiple metastases in one or several organs and the use of the term M1b for oligometastatic disease has the potential to provide rational selection criteria for clinical treatment trials.

9781910797426,ch12,"Unusual tumors of the pancreas and ampulla of Vater. A variety of tumors arise in close proximity to or within the pancreas that require special consideration and need to be differentiated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Table 12.1). Ampullary, bile duct and duodenal tumors. Etiology and pathogenesis. Cancers of the ampulla of Vater, the intrapancreatic bile duct and duodenum are all adenocarcinomas and often present in a manner similar to pancreatic cancer. Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors. All of these tumors progress from a small benign adenoma through to invasive adenocarcinoma, although most are only detected at the cancerous stage. Ampullary tumors arise from the common channel of the ampulla of Vater as benign adenomas and progress as tubulovillous adenomas before becoming adenocarcinomas. Two pathological types of ampullary cancer have been described (intestinal versus pancreaticobiliary), with important consequences for patients' prognosis. Duodenal tumors also commence as adenomas before progressing to invasive adenocarcinoma.

The long-term survival of patients with these cancers is better than that for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Figure 12.1). Imaging and biopsy. Ampullary and duodenal tumors may be visualized by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Brush cytology of the bile duct may also be undertaken for bile duct strictures using ERCP. Invasive adenocarcinomas usually arise deep within an ampullary tumor. For this reason, endoscopic sphincterotomy through the ampullary tumor needs to be performed and biopsies taken from deep within the tumor. Management. Patients with pNETs need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes specialist endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, radiologists and pancreatic surgeons. Medical treatment. The syndromes associated with all of these tumors, except for insulinoma, can be managed medically during the wait for surgery or, if there is metastatic disease, with a long-acting somatostatin receptor antagonist (octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide slow release). Although antitumor efficacy of somatostatin analogs is rather weak, there is disease stabilization in more than 50% of patients. Surgical tumor debulking is commonly undertaken, since the symptoms may still be difficult to control with somatostatin receptor antagonists. Cystic pancreatic tumors. Cystic neoplasms need to be distinguished from pseudocysts secondary to acute or chronic pancreatitis. These tumors include serous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenomas, mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and other rare cystic lesions (cystic neuroendocrine tumors, etc.). Diagnosis is made by CT (Figure 12.4) or MRI with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography sequences (Figure 12.5), usually followed by EUS-guided FNA and analysis of the cystic fluid (Figure 12.6).","Solitary metastases to the pancreas may be worth resecting. Tumor types that occur in the ampullary and periampullary regions may have a much better prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with inherited neuroendocrine tumors require genetic counseling and long-term follow-up for pancreatic and other tumor types. Neuroendocrine tumors should usually be removed surgically. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Cystic pancreatic tumors need to be differentiated from pancreatic pseudocysts, but only a minority need resection at the time of diagnosis.","A variety of tumors arise in close proximity to or within the pancreas that require special consideration and need to be differentiated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (Table 12.1). Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors. Bile duct cancers are also called cholangiocarcinomas, although this term is usually reserved for more proximal bile duct tumors. For this reason, endoscopic sphincterotomy through the ampullary tumor needs to be performed and biopsies taken from deep within the tumor. The syndromes associated with all of these tumors, except for insulinoma, can be managed medically during the wait for surgery or, if there is metastatic disease, with a long-acting somatostatin receptor antagonist (octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide slow release).

9781908541024,ch_13,"Many intracranial tumors present with subacute cognitive decline over several weeks to months. In an elderly patient the differential diagnosis for this clinical presentation is lengthy, ranging from dementia and depression to cerebrovascular disease. Employing excellent neuroimaging early in the diagnostic evaluation usually allows diagnosis of an intracranial mass lesion. As each tumor requires a specific approach to management it is critical to obtain tissue for a pathological diagnosis to avoid administering incorrect and toxic therapies. Recent advances in the management of brain tumors raise a number of issues for older patients. First, older patients are often underrepresented in those clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of a new therapy and thus it is not known if the same benefit can be expected in the geriatric population. Further, the acute toxicity profile associated with a new therapy may be different in the elderly. Finally, the assessment of long-term toxicity associated with new therapies is often limited at the time of initial development and may present differently in older patients.

9781910797617,chp6,"The expanded genetic characterization of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at diagnosis is a critical advance in the last 5 years and is influencing both treatment and patient selection for standard therapy and clinical trials in AML. While the karyotype remains key in prognostication, molecular profiling represents a paradigm shift for both research and the clinical management of AML. Molecular testing is destined to become an essential part of the initial characterization of patients with AML. Drugs in late-stage development. As described in Chapter 3, four new treatments for AML were recently approved, three of which are molecularly targeted products, marking a turning point in the treatment of AML. Several targeted agents are currently in the late stages of clinical development, as described below, and many more approaches are being explored (see Table 6.1). Many of these products in development have been awarded breakthrough status by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recognizing the lack of effective treatments for patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and those with relapsed or refractory disease, for whom the prognosis is poor. FLT3 inhibitors. In addition to midostaurin, several other FLT3 inhibitors are currently in trials. Crenolanib inhibits FLT3 internal tandem repeat (FLT3 -ITD) and FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3 -TKD) mutations in the active conformation but has little activity against cKIT; this is expected to avoid the myelosuppression seen with other FLT3 inhibitors that have been shown to inhibit KIT. The addition of crenolanib to standard 3 + 7 induction therapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML resulted in 88% complete response rate (CR), with no unexpected toxicities. Quizartinib (AC220). A non-randomized Phase II study reported a remission rate of 44% and median overall survival (OS) of 23 weeks in patients with FLT3 -ITD-mutated AML that had relapsed or was refractory to second-line treatment or relapsed following HCT in a non-randomized Phase II study. Quizartinib is being investigated across multiple lines of treatment, including induction and consolidation chemotherapy, as a maintenance therapy for patients in first remission after chemotherapy, and for salvage therapy. Nevertheless, studies of cellular therapies, including CAR-T and natural killer (NK) cells, and antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 and other markers, are of interest. New approaches to treatment include antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and novel antibody-based approaches using bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) and dual-affinity re-targeting (DART) molecules, which bind to CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts, thereby directing activated immune cells to malignant cells. Studies with cellular therapies and other antibody-based therapies are of great interest and promise in AML, including with CAR-T or NK cells, and likewise with antibody products targeting CD123, CD33 or other markers of interest. Included among these are new ADCs and novel antibody-based approaches using BiTEs or DARTs designed to direct activated immune cells to malignant cells (id est dual affinity for CD3 on T-lymphocytes and CD33 on myeloid blasts). Recent experience with enasidenib, approved on the basis of data from patients specifically with IDH2 mutations, challenges the dogma that large randomized controlled trials showing survival benefit in a general AML population are required for approval. The approval of enasidenib was based on data from a single-arm phase 1/2 monotherapy trial involving only 199 patients; historical data were used for the control. This approval reflects the regulatory agencies' recognition of the challenges of evaluating new treatments in relatively rare subtypes of a disease; similar approvals have been seen across a range of oncology (hematologic and solid tumors) in recent years. Trials of new targeted agents are also likely to be in small, clearly identified patient populations. Beat AML is a new approach to clinical trials, begun in late 2016 and sponsored by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. The aim is to quickly and comprehensively genetically characterize older patients (> 60 years) with previously untreated AML and to treat with novel targeted therapy on the basis of the genetic result. Within a week of diagnosis, patients will be assigned to one of nine groups with targetable molecular aberrations (Table 6.2). Each group is treated with unique therapy designed for that molecular aberration. Patients who have more favorable clinical outcomes with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with core binding factor rearrangements or an NPM1 mutation without an FLT3 mutation) are assigned 3 + 7-based treatment in combination with an investigational agent. Patients with poor long-term outcomes and lower remission rates with conventional chemotherapy (such as those with a p53 mutation) receive less intensive therapy. Two examples of treatments in these poor-risk subsets are hypomethylating agent in combination with novel therapy, and monotherapy with an investigational agent followed by lower-intensity treatment (if no response is observed during the monotherapy window). Hopefully, such an approach will quickly identify promising agents and speed up drug approvals in AML. Subsequent iterations of the trial (exempli gratia 'version 2.0' and beyond) will include agents for other targets and possibly combinations of novel drugs.

Of critical importance to the Beat AML trial, as well as for trials of treatments, is the need to achieve disease control in order to facilitate the opportunity for alloHCT for eligible patients. Even in the era of molecular targeted treatment, alloHCT remains the best tool available for the prevention of relapse.","A wide range of targeted agencies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently in the late stages of development, including FLT3 inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, giltertinib, sorafenib), hypomethylating agents (guadecitabine, oral azacitidine), the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat, the blc-2 inhibitor venetoclax and the E-selectin inhibitor GM-1271.

9781908541994,ch02,"Increased sebum production. Acne is a hormonally mediated disease, with androgens contributing to an increase in sebum production from sebaceous glands. Increased sebum production, which presents as seborrhea, correlates well with acne severity. Recent evidence suggests that P. acnes may form a biofilm within follicles that may make them less susceptible to treatment with antibiotics and oxidizing agents. Inflammation. Inflammatory lesions are thought to develop from comedones following the influx of inflammatory cells and/or rupture of the follicular wall. Recent studies have demonstrated the involvement of inflammatory responses even in the very earliest phases of acne lesion development. Inflammatory mediators stimulate vasodilatation and neutrophil chemotaxis into the pores, which may result in papules and pustules. Papules and pustules may evolve into tender inflammatory nodules or 'cysts' as the extent of the inflammation increases. Inflammatory acne may produce scarring. Atrophic scars (Figures 2.2 and 2.3) are caused by a loss of tissue, while hypertrophic or fibrotic scars (Figure 2.4) are due to an increase in tissue. Myths still remain about factors that might influence the disease and the appropriate facts should be shared with the patient. For example, acne is frequently worse before the menstrual period. Stress may worsen acne; in turn, acne certainly and frequently causes more stress. The role of diet in acne is controversial. Factors that have been implicated include 'glycemic load', the intake of dairy products, skim milk, chocolate and whey, obesity, reduced intake of fish, lack of omega-3 fatty acids and others. Epidemiological studies suggest a possible link with intake of skim milk, while clinical trials in very small numbers of patients suggest that a diet with a low glycemic index may be beneficial in patients with acne, as summarized in recent systematic reviews on this topic.","Acne is a hormonally mediated disease.

9781910797471,ch05,"A 67-year-old man with diabetes mellitus, hypertension and renal impairment is referred to the cardiology outpatient department because of fatigue. He is overweight and relatively inactive, but still able to visit his country property and went hunting as recently as last year. He has experienced shortness of breath when climbing two flights of stairs at home and has difficulty in walking uphill to his house. He has no history of ischemic heart disease or other cardiac symptoms. His blood pressure is 164/96 mmHg and he has an irregular pulse of 102 beats per minute. He has no jugular venous distension or edema, and his chest is clear to auscultation; the apex beat is impalpable but there is a blowing pansystolic murmur at the apex. The chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and the ECG shows atrial fibrillation with left bundle branch block. The onset of HF symptoms (Table 5.2) may be acute (typically with pulmonary edema, even with cardiogenic shock) or subacute. Both right and left HF may occur in the context of low output (fatigue, syncope and hypotension), and both right- and left-sided HF usually occur together. Assessment of functional class (see Table 2.1), based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic HF because it is linked to outcome - the annualized mortality in NYHA class IV HF is about 50%, which is four to five times that of class II and twice that of class III. The initial clinical picture of acute HF reflects the varying degree of impairment of cardiac output and elevation in left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure or pulmonary artery wedge pressure (obtained at left and right heart catheterization, respectively). Patients with acute HF can present with one of several distinct hemodynamic profiles, based on the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold) (Figure 5.3). More specific for acute HF is Gheorgiade's classification in which the therapeutic target - cardiac output, blood pressure or intravascular volume - dictates the intervention. Arrhythmias may play a part in both acute and chronic HF. Atrial fibrillation is an important precipitant of acute deterioration and is itself engendered by persistent elevation of filling pressure leading to left atrial enlargement. Atrial arrhythmias contribute to reduced functional capacity, as atrial systole makes an important contribution to stroke volume, especially in the context of LV filling problems and particularly with exercise. Although some patients die from progressive HF, ventricular arrhythmias are an important cause of death in patients with HF. The risk of fatal arrhythmias is greatest in the presence of low ejection fraction, but because of the higher number of patients with less severe reduction of ejection fraction, this group has the highest absolute number of sudden deaths.

Once coronary disease has been identified, the next question is whether this is an 'innocent bystander'. A variety of tests have been reported for the detection of viable myocardium, ranging from the simple (single-photon-emission CT, dobutamine echo) to the complex (MRI, positron emission tomography). Although the STICH trial found no relationship between the results of viability imaging and outcome, it is important to consider not only the presence of dysfunctional but viable tissue, but also its extent, id est the total burden of compromised myocardium, including ischemia. Functional testing involves exercise testing using either a treadmill or ergometer, with or without analysis of expired gases to obtain peak oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide generation. Functional testing is of value for objective quantification of exercise capacity at any stage, but especially in patients who are being evaluated for advanced therapies, including devices and transplantation.","Investigations in patients with HF include blood tests, ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography and other imaging techniques. Assessment of functional class, based on exercise capacity, is important in chronic heart failure (HF) as it is linked to outcome. The hemodynamic profile of acute HF varies according to the degree of pulmonary congestion (wet versus dry) and the state of tissue perfusion (warm versus cold).

9781910797105,ch08,"Neurochemical abnormalities, including changes to the activity of neurotransmitters, are the link between underlying causal factors, either genetic or environmental, and the signs and symptoms of the illness. Over the last 50 years, multiple neurotransmitter systems have been hypothesized to be involved in the neurochemistry of schizophrenia. These hypotheses have fallen in and out of vogue as our knowledge of the brain and our methods for investigating brain neurobiology have become more sophisticated. The major neurochemical pathophysiological hypotheses continue to involve the traditional neurotransmitters, although this situation is changing as novel molecular biological techniques are applied to the study of schizophrenia. In the early 1960s, the Swedish pharmacologist Arvid Carlsson (Figure 8.2) posited the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, in which he stated that schizophrenia was caused by an excess of dopaminergic activity, either an excess of dopamine release and/or hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors. The hypothesis was built on three observations. First was the recognition of a schizophrenia-like psychosis in people who misused amphetamine, a drug known to increase the release of dopamine. Second was the emergence of adverse effects of the recently discovered antipsychotic chlorpromazine, which mimicked Parkinson's disease, itself thought to be due to faulty dopamine transmission. Third was the observation that all effective antipsychotic agents were dopamine receptor antagonists. In the following 15 years, while several experiments provided compelling, but circumstantial, evidence in further support of the importance of the dopamine D receptor in schizophrenia, there remained known shortcomings in the dopamine hypothesis and a lack of direct evidence. In addition, the prediction that untreated patients should have increased numbers of dopamine receptors received no firm support from postmortem assays nor, more critically, from studies using positron emission tomography (PET), which imaged the binding of radiolabeled antipsychotic drugs to receptors. Four developments have helped to revive the dopamine hypothesis. First, the hypothesis was reformulated to predict the existence of both hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic activity in people with schizophrenia. The reformulation states that positive symptoms are due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, whereas negative symptoms are due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway (see Figure 8.1). Four developments have helped to revive the dopamine hypothesis. First, the hypothesis was reformulated to predict the existence of both hyperdopaminergic and hypodopaminergic activity in people with schizophrenia. The reformulation states that positive symptoms are due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, whereas negative symptoms are due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway (see Figure 8.1). Evidence to support a glutamate hypothesis is growing. Postmortem studies have documented abnormal NMDA, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate receptor binding in the prefrontal and temporal cortex, and abnormal NMDA and AMPA messenger RNA receptor expression in the hippocampus. Perhaps the most compelling evidence comes from clinical trials that have examined the efficacy of agents that modify the activity of the NMDA receptor. Some, but not all, of these studies have shown that glycine and D-cycloserine, which bind to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, may be effective treatments for negative symptoms. They have also shown that both positive and negative symptoms may be treated by D-serine, which also binds to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor, and by sarcosine, which inhibits glycine reuptake. Glycine transporter type 1 inhibitors, such as bitopertin, prevent reuptake of synaptic glycine and so enhance NMDA receptor function, but have not been shown to be effective for negative symptoms or cognitive impairments.",Disturbances in the cholinergic and GABAergic systems have been hypothesized to underlie cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. The dopamine hypothesis remains the major neurochemical hypothesis of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms are hypothesized to be due to increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Negative symptoms are hypothesized to be due to decreased activity of the mesocortical dopamine pathway. Altered glutamate activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of negative and positive symptoms and cognitive impairments.,"The major neurochemical pathophysiological hypotheses continue to involve the traditional neurotransmitters, although this situation is changing as novel molecular biological techniques are applied to the study of schizophrenia.

9781912776207,ch4,"Accurate diagnosis and subtyping of PTCL is challenging but crucial, because it determines both prognosis and choice of therapy. The neoplastic nature of a given T-cell population is informed by its morphology, aberrant T-cell phenotype and clonality based on T-cell receptor (TCR) genotype (id est alphabeta versus gammaδ; see page 11). Accumulating evidence indicates that TCR genotype and the cell of origin influence tumor biology and clinical behavior, and are becoming increasingly clinically relevant as targeted therapeutic options emerge. Distinction between the PTCL subtypes requires consideration of the clinical picture, morphology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cytogenetics and molecular biology. Skin rash may be present, particularly in patients with PTCL-NOS or AITL. Patients with AITL may also present with hypotension, fevers, rash and vasculitis-like symptoms, due to tumor-related cytokine release. The initial immunohistochemistry panel should include: CD20, CD10, CD3, CD30, CD4, CD8, CD7, CD2, CD56, CD21, CD23, BCL6, Ki-67, ALK, TCRB and TCRg. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoding region (EBER) in situ hybridization (ISH) should be considered in cases suspected to be nasal ENKTCL. Molecular analysis should include TCR gene rearrangements, and fluorescence ISH to detect genetic alterations. DUSP22 and TP63 rearrangement studies should be considered in patients with ALK − ALCL, as this may affect prognosis. The Ann Arbor staging system used to stage lymphomas (Table 4.4)is analogous to the tumor, nodes, metastases (TNM) system used for solid tumors. The clinical stage depends on where malignant tissue is identified and the presence of systemic B symptoms. PTCL is usually aggressive, and outcomes are generally poor compared with aggressive B-cell lymphomas. For example, the International T-cell Lymphoma study reported overall survival (OS) and failure-free survival of 10% at 10-15 years in patients with PTCL-NOS. Chemokine expression and proliferative signature have been shown to have prognostic significance (Table 4.5). The International Prognostic Index (IPI) was developed in 1993 to identify factors that predict the prognosis of patients with aggressive NHL, as Ann Arbor stage alone did not adequately predict survival outcomes. The IPI has been shown to predict survival in patients with ALCL, AITL and PTCL-NOS, but not for other PTCL entities, and is the most commonly used prognostic index for T-cell lymphoma.","Detailed immunophenotypic analysis is necessary to accurately diagnose PTCL subtypes. PET scanning can be helpful to diagnose extranodal disease. Epstein-Barr virus and CD30 are expressed in several subtypes of PTCL. Many patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas present with systemic symptoms, and extranodal involvement is common. The International Prognostic Index and the PTCL-specific index are useful prognostic tools.","Accumulating evidence indicates that TCR genotype and the cell of origin influence tumor biology and clinical behavior, and are becoming increasingly clinically relevant as targeted therapeutic options emerge.

9781910797495,chp12,"Headache is a common complaint in the general population and one of the most common reasons people seek care from primary care providers. Acute headache. The immediate, important first step in assessing a new headache is determining whether the headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical event requiring emergency evaluation and management. All the possibilities highlighted in Table 12.1 must be entertained and discarded before considering the headache to be caused by a chronic headache condition. Brain imaging, including neurovascular studies, may be needed as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure measurement and analysis and further evaluation by a neurologist. For most chronic headaches, diagnostic tests are unnecessary except when a 'red flag' on history or physical examination indicates concern for an intracerebral mass and the need for imaging, or history and physical examination indicate a need for spinal evaluation and related imaging. In occipital neuralgia, sometimes neural blockade of the occipital nerves can help with diagnosis. Administration of indometacin (indomethacin) results in complete relief of chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) and this effect continues with long-term treatment. Cluster headache diagnosis may be aided by the autonomic features and at least partial response to inhaled oxygen. Migraine. The treatment approach for migraine is best conceptualized as longitudinal chronic disease management in three parts: preventive measures, abortive treatment and symptom management. This approach is based on understanding the phenomenological pattern of each individual's headache, as in Figure 12.1. First, preventive treatments aim to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of attacks and include daily use of medications such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, alpha -agonists, and beta-blockers (Table 12.4). Second, once prodromal or actual migraine symptoms occur, a stepped-care approach should be taken (Table 12.5). It is important to avoid frequent regular dosing (more than twice weekly) of short-acting analgesics or sedatives such as compounds containing butalbital (a short-acting barbiturate often compounded with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or paracetamol [acetaminophen]), to reduce the incidence of transform (rebound) daily headaches. Psychotherapies, such as support/directive and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), may help patients manage a complex interaction of factors that perpetuate headache. Botulinum toxin injections have been reported to be successful in some case series, but the clinical trials are equivocal; a trial should be reserved for treatment-resistant patients. For intractable migraine and occipital neuralgia, non-invasive methods of vagal neurostimulation and transcranial magnetic neurostimulation may serve as useful adjuncts to more conventional therapies. Trials of more invasive forms of neuromodulation in the form of temporary insertion of suboccipital electrodes result in about 50% of these patients proceeding to permanent implantation of electrodes with a pulse generator.","In patients without history of chronic headaches, determine whether an acute new headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition. In chronic headache:- use a headache diary to differentiate headache type and establish pattern of triggers to enable self-management strategies- institute preventive measures such as trigger avoidance, stress control and medication- institute abortive regimen appropriate for headache type- migraine: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), stress control, triptans- tension/myofascial: NSAIDs, stress control, icing, stretching- avoid regular frequent analgesic use to reduce incidence of transform (rebound) headache physical dependency.","The immediate, important first step in assessing a new headache is determining whether the headache is a serious, potentially life-threatening medical event requiring emergency evaluation and management.

9781912776726,ch2,"The signs and symptoms of glioblastoma result from direct compression and infiltration of surrounding brain tissue and secondarily from the effects of raised intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the tumor and edema. There is no fixed pattern of symptom progression; specific signs and symptoms will vary from person to person depending on the area of the brain that is affected (see Typical locations, Table 1.1). Neurological deficit. Patients commonly experience focal neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, sensory loss or visual field defects, reflecting the location of the tumor. Patients with frontal tumors often present with cognitive deficits, a change in personality or a mood disorder and are often mistakenly diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Five percent of patients present with aphasia due to a tumor in the speech-dominant hemisphere, which may be mistaken for confusion or delirium. Patients with larger tumors may also experience incontinence and difficulties with gait due to mass effect. A systematic review identified symptom prevalence in patients at different stages of their glioma treatment. Glioblastoma is grade IV disease and so is not formally staged. The most common symptoms are shown in Table 2.1; other symptoms included alopecia, anorexia, anxiety/depression, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, dyspepsia, gait disturbance, nausea/vomiting, pain, right-left confusion, sensory deficits, skin problems, urinary incontinence and visual defects. Eight of the ten most prevalent symptoms shown in Table 2.1 (excluding confusion and dysphagia) are included in at least two of the three assessment tools for patient-reported outcome measures: the brain cancer-specific European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BN20), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br), and the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory for Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT) module. These instruments are mostly used in clinical trials or research studies as a means of monitoring disease trajectory and the effect of treatments on quality of life and symptoms (Figure 2.1). They are important, as good symptom management has been shown to improve survival in other diseases such as lung cancer; however, symptoms are predominantly caused by the tumor, and to a lesser degree by the treatment. Note: these may occur at different phases in the disease trajectory (see Figure 2.1). Adapted from data in IJzerman-Korevaar et al. 2018. Note: these may occur at different phases in the disease trajectory (see Figure 2.1). Adapted from data in IJzerman-Korevaar et al. 2018. Confusion (40.3%), dysphagia (41.9%) and dyspnea (17.7%) are more prevalent at the end of life than during diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. A higher prevalence of confusion is seen at the end of life in patients with primary brain tumors than in patients with brain metastases or a general palliative care population. Aside from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life in cancer, such as anorexia and weight loss, tend to occur less often in patients with glioma than in other patients receiving palliative care. A study that compared 65 patients with glioblastoma at postsurgical baseline versus 130 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, reported that patients with glioblastoma frequently experience fatigue, suggesting that factors other than those related to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, such as depression and tumor localization, have a significant impact. Thus, patients require tailored symptom care at different times during the course of their disease. Note: these may occur at different phases in the disease trajectory (see Figure 2.1).

Headache and dizziness are more common in the early diagnostic phase, and nausea/vomiting, visual deficits and anorexia are more prevalent during treatment. Confusion, dysphagia, dyspnea, aphasia, drowsiness and fatigue are more prevalent at the end of life. The most prevalent symptoms of glioblastoma are neurological in nature. Apart from fatigue, the symptoms most commonly associated with end of life (exempli gratia anorexia, weight loss) in patients receiving palliative care for other forms of cancer are less common in patients with glioblastoma. The trajectory of the disease varies widely from patient to patient depending on the location of the tumor and other patient- and treatment-related factors.

In general, incidence was similar in men and women in the systematic review, although the incidence of ET was numerically higher in women (Table 2.1).

By contrast, real-world data from the UK population-based Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN) show that age-standardized incidence is similar for ET, PV and MPN, unclassifiable, whereas myelofibrosis is approximately twice as common in men as in women. Most of the available epidemiology data are from Europe and North America; the incidence of the MPNs is similar in these two regions, as shown in Table 2.2. In general, patients with ET or PV have a near-normal life expectancy with current treatment strategies, whereas PMF is associated with reduced survival. The UK HMRN has reported 3-year relative survival rates of more than 90% in patients with the chronic MPNs (ET, PV, MPN, unclassifiable) compared with fewer than 70% in those with myelofibrosis (Figure 2.1). However, the emergence of new and improved treatments in recent years has markedly improved survival rates. For example, the introduction of phlebotomy as a routine treatment for PV increased median survival from less than 2 years to approximately 14 years. Genetic predisposition. In addition to the presence of the driver mutations described in Chapter 1, age is a predominant risk factor for the MPNs. In the UK HMRN study, the median age at diagnosis in people with chronic MPNs was 70-74 years (Table 2.4). PV tended to be diagnosed at an earlier age in men than in women. An estimated 7-8% of individuals with apparently sporadic MPN have a family history with at least two cases of MPN, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Such familial cases are presumed to be due to acquisition of the somatic driver mutation through a genetic predisposition. To date, familial MPN has been identified in only a small number of families; however, identification of such cases may facilitate early diagnosis and appropriate intervention.

Other risk factors for the MPNs have been proposed (Table 2.5), although in many cases the supporting evidence is limited. Two major long-term epidemiology studies have reported strong evidence that increased body mass index and smoking have significant associations with some or all of the MPNs.","The incidence of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) is approximately 2.6 per 100 000.

9781910797617,chp1,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy that affects the blood and bone marrow. The build up of abnormal white blood cells interferes with the production of red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells, and indirectly leads to leukemic complications of infection, fatigue and hemorrhage. Complications also arise directly from the proliferation and accumulation of immature leukemia cells, which can affect blood flow or infiltrate other organs. The pathogenesis is described in more detail on page 9. Incidence data specific for AML worldwide are limited, as AML is usually included within the broader category of leukemia in epidemiology registries such as GLOBOCAN. The incidence of AML in the USA is 4.2 per 100 000 per year, with an estimated 21 380 new cases in 2017. AML accounts for about 1.3% of all new cancer cases and 31% of all new leukemia cases. In the UK in 2014, there were 3072 new cases of AML (fewer than 1% of all new cancer cases); there the incidence has risen by 28% since the early 1990s.

This is attributed to a marked increase in intrinsic chemoresistance with age and a greater number of comorbidities that compromise tolerance to chemotherapy. Some older patients do not receive treatment for AML because of these concerns, although data from the Swedish Acute Leukemia Registry demonstrate that this population benefits from treatment instead of purely palliative care., Figure 1.2 shows overall survival estimates by age group for patients in the Swedish registry. Advances in genetics have dramatically improved our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML. Although in-depth understanding of the relationship between a specific genetic mutation and a specific pathophysiological or clinical feature is clear in only a few cases, this is slowly changing. One such example is the association of the PML-RARA fusion gene with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is a subtype of AML (see Tables 2.2 and 2.3). The PML-RARA fusion gene is typically detected as a chromosomal rearrangement: t(15;17)(q22;q21). Patients with APL have a high risk for fatal hemorrhage due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the consequence of a halt in myeloid differentiation that is mediated by the PML-RARA fusion gene. The PML-RARA fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein that disrupts various cellular processes, including nuclear body formation and apoptosis, adversely affecting normal myeloid development. In normal cells, RARA encodes a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family of transcription factors; PML is important in controlling proliferation and apoptosis, among other processes. The PML-RARA fusion protein suppresses gene transcription and blocks differentiation beyond the promyelocyte stage, resulting in the accumulation of malignant promyelocytes seen in APL. Degranulation of promyelocytes contributes to the development of DIC in patients with APL, putting them at risk for hemorrhage. The complex role of the PML-RARA fusion protein in modulating cellular functions is largely, and remarkably, understood. Treatment of APL is unique and ultimately capitalizes on these unique pathophysiological findings (though clinical advances preceded genetic understanding in this case; see pages 49-50 for the treatment of APL).

Treatment of APL is unique and ultimately capitalizes on these unique pathophysiological findings (though clinical advances preceded genetic understanding in this case; see pages 49-50 for the treatment of APL). Most cases of AML are idiopathic, arising in previously healthy individuals with no (or unknown) genetic predisposition. Advancing age is the main risk factor for AML, as noted above and described by TCGA, but a number of other risk factors contribute to the development of AML in some patients. These include familial risk, environmental exposure to chemicals, drugs or ionizing radiation, and antecedent hematologic disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Familial risk. Although most cases of AML are not familial, it is now clear that myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition (exempli gratia an inherited risk) are more frequent than has been recognized previously. Myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition - that is, AML and related disorders that arise in the setting of an inherited genetic mutation which puts the patient at increased risk for developing the disease - are an important component of the forthcoming revision to the World Health Organization classification of AML (see Table 2.3). Germline mutations associated with an increased risk of developing a myeloid neoplasm occur in the CEBPA, DDX41, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6 and GATA2 genes, among others.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relatively rare cancer. It is due to proliferation of immature myeloid cells, which interfere with the production of normal red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Patients typically require transfusion support and are at risk for potentially fatal infection. AML is uniformly fatal without treatment. AML is the most common acute leukemia in older adults, with median age at diagnosis of 67-69 years. Long-term survival of patients with AML is poor: about a quarter of patients survive 5 years but only 10% of older patients. Our understanding of the genetic basis for AML is improving. A small number of mutations are seen in the typical AML patient; the mutation profile of an individual patient may change over time. Inherited risk is uncommon but is likely to be more frequent than is currently understood. Most cases of AML are idiopathic; however, prior exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors and alkylating agents increases the risk of AML.","In the UK in 2014, there were 3072 new cases of AML (fewer than 1% of all new cancer cases); there the incidence has risen by 28% since the early 1990s.

9781908541963,chapter3,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality throughout the world. In the USA, approximately 2 million people suffer from an alcohol-induced liver disorder. In the UK in 2012, ALD accounted for 63% (4425) of all alcohol-related deaths, an 18% increase on 2002. Medical costs associated with caring for these patients are enormous. Alcohol-related liver injury presents a spectrum of disease, including asymptomatic hepatic steatosis (fatty liver), steatosis accompanied by inflammation (steatohepatitis or alcoholic hepatitis), cirrhosis with liver failure, variceal bleeding, ascites and even the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Intervention for patients presenting with the early stages of liver injury helps to prevent further permanent liver injury. Interrupting alcoholism is the key, but this is not an easy task and frustrates many primary care providers, families and patients. Liver function tests. Examination of laboratory results is helpful in diagnosing ALD. The aminotransferases are elevated and have a characteristic pattern in patients with ALD: the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is almost always higher than the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and the greater the ratio the more likely that the liver disease is due to alcohol. Alkaline phosphatase and serum bilirubin levels may be increased, the prothrombin time (PT) prolonged and the albumin level depressed. The last two are good markers of the severity of ALD. However, it should also be noted that liver function tests may be entirely normal in the presence of cirrhosis, particularly if the patient has achieved sobriety. Nutrition. Alcoholics are usually malnourished, and improving nutrition is associated with improved outcomes. This is particularly important for patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Anorexia may prevent adequate nutrition and feeding via an enteral tube is sometimes required. Most alcoholics need protein. Unfortunately, however, a few patients with advanced liver disease develop hepatic encephalopathy when given large amounts of protein. Consultation with dietitians may be beneficial. Corticosteroids. Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammatory condition. Thus, corticosteroids are a logical treatment for ALD. However, despite many studies that have investigated the role of corticosteroids in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis, there is no clear consensus on their efficacy. Most hepatologists believe that patients with the most severe forms of alcoholic hepatitis - id est those with a Maddrey's discriminant function (DF) score greater than 32 - will benefit from a course of corticosteroids. The DF score is calculated with the simple formula.","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a common cause of end-stage liver disease. Early intervention prevents permanent injury, but interrupting alcoholism can be difficult. Patients with ALD typically have mild to moderate elevations in aminotransferases, with AST > ALT. Patients with ALD are often malnourished; improving nutrition is an important treatment goal.

9781908541796,chapter1,"Lymphoma is a malignancy of lymphocytes and their progenitors. The term lymphoma encompasses a broad range of lymphoid malignancies, which is reflected in the complexity of the classification systems (see Appendix, page 131). Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is clinically useful, it is now recognized that many of the broader categories, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, include several distinct entities, each of which may have its own unique epidemiological and etiologic profile. Consequently, it is difficult to present an all-encompassing overview of the epidemiology of lymphoma. Incidence and relevant factors.

This makes lymphoma the sixth or seventh most common cancer worldwide. Relatively uncommon risk factors with high relative risk. Immuno-deficiency states are the most obvious examples of a relatively uncommon risk factor that carries a high relative risk. It has been suggested that the rising incidence of lymphoma during the 1980s and 1990s reflected an increasing incidence of immunodeficiency, most obviously due to the emergence of HIV and AIDS. Indeed, HIV/AIDS has been shown to be a major risk factor for the development of lymphoma, but it accounts for less than 50% of the increase in incidence seen in the West. Furthermore, since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of AIDS-associated lymphoma has declined. Common risk factors with low relative risk. Many environmental factors have been implicated in the development of lymphoma (see below). Most of these have been identified using case-control retrospective analyses, which have disadvantages, such as recall and selection bias, that can reduce the validity of the results. Further large prospective cohort studies are needed, some of which are ongoing. However, it must be remembered that a relatively innocuous environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk of developing lymphoma can contribute substantially to a rising incidence if a sufficiently large number of people are exposed. Nevertheless, it is not possible to test for every environmental exposure that carries only a marginally raised relative risk. Inflammatory conditions. Certain inflammatory conditions predispose to the development of NHL and particularly extranodal marginal zone/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas, which are associated with organ-specific autoimmune conditions. For example, Sjögren syndrome (an autoimmune condition affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands) is associated with a 15-fold increased risk of developing salivary or lacrimal MALT lymphomas, and Hashimoto disease (an autoimmune condition affecting the thyroid gland) predisposes to thyroid MALT lymphoma. Pesticide/herbicide exposure has been implicated in the etiology of NHL in numerous studies. Agents include organophosphates, phenoxyacetic acid herbicides and triazine herbicides. However, the results are inconsistent with wide variations in the estimates of risk. Presumably this is because most investigations have been case-control studies in which the estimation of risk is fraught with difficulty. Some studies have also demonstrated an association between specific pesticides and herbicides and NHL subtypes but, again, the results are inconsistent.","The epidemiology of lymphoma is difficult to study owing to the existence of so many different subtypes of the disease, each with its own epidemiology and associated causative factors. An understanding of the epidemiology has, in some instances, led to an understanding of causative factors such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma increased dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s but has plateaued in recent years. Large cohort studies are required to verify many of the potential causative factors. Various other subtypes of lymphoma have been linked with infection, particularly immunosuppression-related lymphomas caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas caused by various bacterial infections.","Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system is clinically useful, it is now recognized that many of the broader categories, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, include several distinct entities, each of which may have its own unique epidemiological and etiologic profile.

9781908541963,chapter5,"Autoimmune liver diseases. Three liver diseases are categorized as autoimmune in etiology. autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which targets the hepatocyte. primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), which affects the microscopic bile ducts. primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which can involve any elements of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary system. AIH and PBC are predominantly autoimmune diseases, but the categorization is less clear-cut with PSC. The classic immunologic profiles associated with these conditions are shown in Table 5.1. Some diagnostic confusion can occur because of the existence of 'overlap syndromes' or histological progression from apparent AIH to either PBC or PSC. AIH and PBC are predominantly autoimmune diseases, but the categorization is less clear-cut with PSC. The classic immunologic profiles associated with these conditions are shown in Table 5.1. Some diagnostic confusion can occur because of the existence of 'overlap syndromes' or histological progression from apparent AIH to either PBC or PSC. Autoimmune hepatitis. AIH is a chronic inflammatory liver disease of at least 6 months' duration. The target cell for the immunologic response is the hepatocyte, and the dominant effector cells are lymphocytes and plasma cells. Two types of AIH are defined by classic autoantibody profiles. These antibodies are associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, with a dominant elevation in the immunoglobulin (Ig) G fraction in untreated disease. Histological verification and staging of the disease is mandatory. The classic finding on liver histology is portal inflammation, with plasma cells and lymphocytes spilling over into the lobule in a pattern called interface hepatitis (Figure 5.1). Fibrosis or cirrhosis may be established by the time of presentation or may develop during follow-up despite apparently adequate therapy. Clinical features. There is a strong gender association, with 70% of cases occurring in women. The age at presentation has a bimodal distribution, with peaks during the second decade and the fourth and fifth decades. AIH can present as an acute hepatitis-like illness, with jaundice and a laboratory profile showing hyperbilirubinemia and a marked elevation in serum aminotransferases (transaminases). A liver biopsy will show the characteristic features, with or without fibrosis or cirrhosis. Alternatively, patients may present with established cirrhosis in the absence of any previous episode of jaundice or other symptoms alerting to the presence of chronic hepatitis. These patients may present with liver failure or complications of portal hypertension. As with all causes of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, but this risk is at the lower end of the spectrum in this condition. PBC is a progressive disease with an asymptomatic phase that may last for 15-20 years. The asymptomatic phase is being increasingly recognized, however, with the detection of increased alkaline phosphatase levels on routine blood tests. The diagnosis is effectively established by the detection of positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), usually of the M2 subtype. The IgM fraction of the serum gammaglobulins is normally raised. The combination of elevated alkaline phosphatase, positive AMA and elevated IgM is now considered diagnostic of PBC; histological verification is no longer necessary. However, a liver biopsy may be of value in staging the severity of the disease. Liver transplantation is still the only effective treatment for advanced PBC. The indications for transplantation are liver failure, defined by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) as a disease severity score ranging from 4 to 40, typically above 20; severe and intractable pruritus; and hepatocellular carcinoma The results of liver transplantation for PBC are excellent. There is evidence that PBC recurs in the transplanted liver, but this phenomenon appears to be of little clinical relevance in the first 10-15 years after transplantation.","Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is potentially treatable if diagnosed before the development of cirrhosis. Autoimmune liver disease can target the hepatocyte or any element of the bile duct system. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis and is unpredictable; late disease can be managed effectively with liver transplantation unless complicated by cholangiocarcinoma. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive disease, with a presymptomatic period of up to 20 years.

Patient registries have now been developed for PK deficiency, which are helping to characterize the range of symptoms and complications arising from this disorder. As discussed in Chapter 1, mutations in the PKLR gene on chromosome 1 are responsible for PK deficiency. More than 300 different mutations have been reported; most are very rare, occurring only once. Currently, about 25% of patients diagnosed with PK deficiency appear to have a previously unrecorded mutation. Although many of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are rare, a few are recorded more frequently (Table 2.1). The variability in how PK deficiency manifests is thought to reflect the heterogeneity of these causative mutations, as well as the fact that most individuals with PK deficiency will be compound heterozygotes (id est they will have a different mutation in each copy of the PKLR gene). Approximately 70% of the mutations associated with PK deficiency are missense (M) mutations (id est a single nucleotide change resulting in the production of a different amino acid), while the others are more disruptive non-missense (NM) mutations - either nonsense or insertional mutations, deletions (such as the deletion of exon 11 found in the Romany population), or splicing abnormalities (see pages 43 -). While almost all cases of PK deficiency are inherited and result from mutations in the PKLR gene, an acquired form of the deficiency can very rarely occur secondarily to other blood diseases, such as acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and refractory sideroblastic anemia.

GDM is defined as glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Previously there were no uniformly accepted international standards for the diagnosis of GDM. New evidence has emerged to change practice. The large multinational Hyperglycemia and Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study has demonstrated a linear relationship between maternal hyperglycemia and birth weight, with no apparent threshold effect between maternal glycemia and pregnancy outcome. The Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study in Pregnant Women (ACHOIS) has established that treatment of GDM with insulin improves pregnancy outcomes (such as birth weight, macrosomia and shoulder dystocia). The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) has attempted to achieve an international consensus on screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes. It recommends a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for all women who are not known to be diabetic at 24-28 weeks. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed when one or more threshold values are exceeded (fasting >= 5.1 mmol/L [92 mg/dL), 1-hour >= 10.0 mmol/L [180 mg/dL], 2-hour >= 8.5 mmol/L [153 mg/dL]). Other guidelines (for example, those from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [SIGN]) advocate a more selective approach to screening on the basis of risk factors (for example, obesity, a first-degree relative with diabetes, ethnicity, advanced maternal age, previous GDM and a previous macrosomic baby).","Diabetic pregnancy is associated with fetal morbidity. GDM is becoming increasingly common, particularly in certain ethnic groups. Treatment of GDM is associated with improved fetal outcome. Miscarriage rates are high in diabetic pregnancy. The congenital malformation rate is 5.1-9.8%. Strict glycemic control improves the outcome of diabetic pregnancy. Both growth restriction and growth acceleration may complicate diabetic pregnancy. Fetal macrosomia increases the likelihood of birth injury.

9781912776153,chp3,"Syncope is a significant healthcare problem, resulting in the need for clinical evaluation, whether acutely in the emergency room or later in the physician's office. On the one hand, syncope can be benign, such as vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope, but on the other, it can be serious with a potentially fatal outcome, such as ventricular arrhythmias or heart block. In all of these situations, syncope is usually of considerable concern to the patient and may result in sequelae such as injury, restriction of driving, or even death. What is syncope?. Cerebral blood flow depends on maintenance of blood pressure, which in turn is directly related to both cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance such that a drop in either may be associated with a fall or presyncope. Syncope is defined as a total loss of consciousness (sometimes also referred to as transient loss of consciousness), and presyncope is defined as a sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness but do not actually do so).

Patients often use the term 'dizzy spell', which covers a multitude of etiologies, including vertigo and postural symptoms; a detailed history of what the patient actually feels is mandatory. Although many patients are briefly disorientated on regaining consciousness, recovery is rapid and complete within a short period (usually minutes). It is unusual to have a prolonged period of unconsciousness (more than 5 minutes) with a cardiac cause, although witness description is notoriously unreliable. Patients are usually lucid quickly after an episode. Tonic-clonic seizure, although uncommon, can occur because of cerebral anoxia and does not exclude a cardiac cause. Urinary incontinence is rare. The desire to sleep afterwards is also uncommon. Syncope is much more common than epilepsy. Recurrent presyncope (the sensation patients describe when they feel they are about to lose consciousness) is common and may culminate in syncope over time. Presyncope occurs commonly in situations where the native cardiac pacemaker is impaired but not for long enough to produce syncope (exempli gratia sick sinus syndrome or carotid sinus hypersensitivity). Self-injury is variable. In some cases, symptoms may occur over many years before a diagnosis is made. In many cases, specific precipitating factors are uncommon. Presyncope needs to be differentiated from dizziness, which can include vertigo. Syncope in patients with known structural heart disease, particularly impaired left ventricular (LV) function, carries a significantly worse prognosis with an increased risk of sudden death. Syncope may be due to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or intermittent advanced heart block. These patients require urgent cardiological investigation. The differential diagnoses for the causes of falls and blackouts are shown in Table 3.3. Patients with cardiac syncope often do not remember the loss of consciousness and therefore only consider that they have had a fall.

9781908541468,ch_14,"Renal replacement therapy and transplantation. Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). conservative care and symptom control. dialysis (either peritoneal or hemodialysis). kidney transplant (from a living or cadaveric donor). In general, all patients should be offered all suitable choices, and be fully counseled as to the advantages and disadvantages of each. In reality, however, not all options are available in all centers, and patient-related factors can be limiting. Dialysis may not improve quality of life in patients with extensive comorbidities. Indeed, there is some evidence that very elderly patients, with only limited comorbid illnesses, may not even have the length of their lives prolonged by dialysis. In these circumstances, many patients opt for symptom control without dialysis, using erythropoietin, vitamin D analogs, dietary control, antipruritics and antiemetics as necessary. Such patients often have significantly better quality of life, fewer hospital admissions (exempli gratia from dialysis-related complications), and are more likely to die finally at home rather than in hospital than patients receiving dialysis. Patients need excellent vascular access, and access problems are a major cause of morbidity (Table 12.1). Access is obtained through either a fistula created between a peripheral artery and vein (usually radial or brachial), or a permanent plastic catheter inserted into an internal jugular or subclavian vein (Figure 12.2). Hemodialysis can be carried out in a main hospital center, a satellite unit (often staffed only by nurses) or in the patient's home. Home hemodialysis offers patients the most autonomy, but requires a suitable house with a water supply, space (for the machine and supplies), a reasonably technically competent patient and usually a trained helper who will be present during each dialysis session. Patients dialysing at home often have the best quality of life. Dialysis is usually performed three times each week for about 4 hours. Some patients opt for daily hemodialysis (usually 6 days/week), which provides the best control of fluid balance and biochemistry, but is intensive. Patients can dialyse overnight while they sleep either at home or in dialysis centers. It is difficult to determine the optimum amount of dialysis a patient requires, and various methods are in use.

Patients can dialyse overnight while they sleep either at home or in dialysis centers. It is difficult to determine the optimum amount of dialysis a patient requires, and various methods are in use. When to start dialysis. The question of when to start dialysis remains controversial. In general, patients should begin dialysis when estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is in the range of 8-10 mL/minute/1.73m. There is no good evidence that starting dialysis earlier is of any benefit to patients. If dialysis is delayed for too long, however, patients can become very malnourished. Nevertheless, there are excellent data suggesting that earlier referral for nephrological care before renal replacement therapy is required can significantly delay the need for dialysis, and reduce early morbidity and mortality. Common complications. Routine postoperative problems, such as deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and pneumonia, can occur. Specific problems include opportunistic infections (viral, fungal, bacterial), malignancies (especially skin cancers), drug toxicity, recurrence of the original disease in the transplant, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia and graft failure (Table 12.6). Patients should be followed up for life and undergo annual screening for cancers, drug toxicity and cardiovascular disease in addition to routine clinic visits. Most patients with a transplant will die from cardiovascular disease, which should, therefore, be aggressively managed. Fertility is usually restored in women after a kidney transplant, but transplant recipients have a high risk of hypertension during pregnancy, and an increased risk of miscarriage in the first trimester and premature delivery. Some immunosuppressants (exempli gratia mycophenolate mofetil) also pose a risk to the fetus.","Not all patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) need or want dialysis, and some may be managed conservatively. Peritoneal dialysis is an excellent modality for many patients, especially early in ESKD. Hemodialysis requires excellent vascular access; problems with access cause significant morbidity. Transplantation offers the best long-term outcomes, but at the expense of long-term side effects from immunosuppression, including cancers and cardiovascular disease. Most patients will require several modalities of renal replacement therapy in their lifetime. Most women on dialysis are infertile. Fertility is restored after transplantation, but pregnant transplant recipients have an increased risk of hypertension, miscarriage in the first trimester and premature delivery.","Three choices for renal replacement therapy are available for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Hayne and colleagues have summarized the current status of several relevant trials with BCG. Several relevant biomarkers for risk stratification and prediction of response to treatment of bladder cancer are being explored (exempli gratia FGFR, VEGFR, HER2, circulating tumor DNA) and some (exempli gratia PD-L1) are beginning to be used in clinical practice in the hope that this might increase the probability that patients receiving treatments aimed at such targets will respond to them; however, uptake of such assays remains limited on a global scale and it is not yet clear whether their use improves outcomes. Improvements in the specificity and sensitivity of assays are required before these approaches are used in routine practice. Better technology in this arena, including tests that are less invasive than cystoscopy or biopsy and therefore more acceptable to patients, will lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment and reduction of costs. Future developments are likely to involve refinements based on rational assessment of the tumor biology based on genomic, proteomic or immunologic profiling. However, incorporation of these assays into clinical practice requires care, particularly if the tissue was not obtained recently (exempli gratia past cystectomy) or is not representative of the cancer (exempli gratia small endoscopic biopsy of a bladder tumor in a patient with widespread metastatic disease). We will do well to learn from experience with the PD-L1 assays and the effects that blind faith in an unproven biomarker can have on clinical trial outcomes and drug development, as seen in the IMvigor 211 trial of atezolizumab (see page 77). Most of the progress in bladder cancer management in the last 20 years has been in supportive care. This relates to improvement in quality of life through better control of symptoms, reduction in treatment-related toxicity, improved management of comorbidities and involvement of other disciplines such as exercise physiology, where improvements in cancer-specific outcomes can also be shown. There is a risk that quality of life is sacrificed by favoring treatments that have good efficacy but might be toxic. Whilst this is understandable, our patients often tell us that quality of life is more important than extending survival. It is important to recognize this, and to remember when considering the choice of treatment in the setting of incurable cancer, that improvement, or at least maintenance, of quality of life and functioning is a paramount objective. It is heartening to see this growing emphasis on patient-reported outcomes. A further benefit from this approach is the focus on reducing and managing the toxicities of treatment, with consequent improvements in response (and potentially cure) rates as well.","Earlier diagnosis will shift the pattern of disease towards more favorable stage and grade cancers. Outcomes in advanced disease are likely to improve through the uptake of new therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as better application of existing evidence and treatments. Improved biological characterization of tumors may point towards more appropriate and patient-specific treatments, including those aimed at specific molecular targets. Public health preventative measures are likely to have the greatest influence on bladder cancer outcomes globally. Multidisciplinary management and extended supportive and palliative care measures will increasingly be adopted and improve cancer outcomes and quality of life.","Most non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is low or intermediate risk (low-grade Ta), can be managed endoscopically and requires only limited further assessment or treatment.

9781910797211,ch04,"Levodopa is a precursor of dopamine and restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells. It has improved the quality of patients' lives substantially, and appears to have led to a reduction in mortality. Levodopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylation in the brain (Figure 4.1), but this can also occur outside the blood-brain barrier, leading to side effects such as nausea and postural hypotension. The addition of a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, such as carbidopa or benserazide, inhibits dopa decarboxylase in the rest of the body and reduces side effects. The bioavailability of levodopa has been enhanced further by the emergence of drugs such as tolcapone and entacapone, which inhibit catechol- O -methyl transferase (COMT), the enzyme principally responsible for the breakdown of dopamine. However, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. A postmortem study of 5 patients with essential tremor, who were mistakenly given sustained levodopa therapy, found no evidence of damage to nigral cells. In addition, patients who receive long-term levodopa for restless legs syndrome show no evidence of damage to the substantia nigra at autopsy. These findings should reassure patients receiving long-term levodopa. Levodopa dyskinesia. Chronic therapy with levodopa, however, results in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias due to Parkinson's disease progression coupled with the short half-life of levodopa. The ELLDOPA study (see below) in patients with early Parkinson's disease suggests that a higher dosage of levodopa leads to a higher frequency of dyskinesia. The development of dyskinesias has been shown to adversely affect patients' and carers' quality of life, and to at least double the cost of care. In order to prevent/delay dyskinesia, several trials have examined initiating treatment with a dopamine agonist such as ropinirole, pramipexole, cabergoline or pergolide. Many trials have compared these dopamine agonists with levodopa in previously untreated patients over a 4-5 year period. CDS may prevent or reverse motor complications because it does not prime the basal ganglia for involuntary movements as much as agents that produce pulsatile stimulation. CDS may also improve some aspects of sleep in patients with Parkinson's disease. However, Nutt reinforced the idea that CDS remains a theoretical concept, and the effect of CDS on dyskinesias, to date, has never been tested in a robust randomized clinical trial. The STRIDE-PD study (see pages 66 -) with the drugs given orally every 3.5 hours probably failed to provide CDS. In practice, dopamine agonists are also useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa, as well as the many theoretical advantages listed in Table 4.4. Ropinirole and pramipexole are well-established non-ergot dopamine agonists in widespread clinical use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. Both are effective in early and late disease as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy. In addition, pramipexole has been investigated for its anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects in Parkinson's disease. A direct beneficial effect of pramipexole on depressive symptoms, accounting for 80% of total treatment effect, was found in a 12-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of the drug in 287 mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease patients with depressive symptoms. Impulse-control disorders. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition) defines impulse control disorders (ICDs) as the failure to resist an impulse, drive or temptation to perform an act that is harmful to the person or to others. These are increasingly reported in Parkinson's disease and include a range of compulsive disorders (Table 4.5). Typically, the syndrome is characterized by a combination of impulsivity, compulsivity and preoccupation with a behavior or mood state. Unrecognized, ICDs can have serious consequences, such as breakdowns in interpersonal relationships and financial distress. The lifetime prevalence of ICDs, as reported by patients attending specialized clinics, is between 3 and 8%, although the DOMINION study reported a higher rate of 13.7% with ICDs, including problem/pathological gambling (5%), compulsive sexual behavior (3.5%), compulsive buying (5.7%) and binge-eating disorder (4.3%). Current guidelines. Different international guidelines (NICE, AAN, EFNS/MDS-ES) all agree that there is no single universal first choice of drug for people with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the early stages of the condition. Individual choice of drug will be influenced, for example, by the degree of motor disability (if severe, the first choice is likely to be levodopa), occupational needs, the risk of motor complications (more common in younger patients, which would be delayed by agonists), neuropsychiatric complications (more common in older and cognitively impaired patients, so agonists should be avoided), patient/clinician preferences and adherence issues. For these reasons, many younger patients will choose a levodopa-sparing strategy, while older patients may prefer levodopa therapy (see below). Guidelines for the management of Parkinson's disease published in the UK by NICE in June 2006 offer evidence-based advice drawn up by a multidisciplinary panel. Key recommendations are that patients and their carers should be involved in deciding their treatment and care, and that the choice of treatment should suit the patient's needs and preferences. This guideline is currently being updated. The following key points were identified as priorities for implementation. Dopamine agonist versus levodopa. In younger patients, the issues of neuroprotection and dyskinesias should be considered. The results of four controlled dopamine-agonist monotherapy trials have been published and suggest that initiation of treatment with an agonist is beneficial in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. However, the results of the PD Med study, a multicenter real-life pragmatic study, reporting on quality of life-related outcomes in both young and old patients with Parkinson's disease, is likely to generate considerable controversy regarding the use of dopamine agonists and the choice of initial therapy. In total, 1620 patients with early Parkinson's disease were recruited and given one of three initial treatment regimens. Dopamine agonist versus levodopa. In younger patients, the issues of neuroprotection and dyskinesias should be considered. The results of four controlled dopamine-agonist monotherapy trials have been published and suggest that initiation of treatment with an agonist is beneficial in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. However, the results of the PD Med study, a multicenter real-life pragmatic study, reporting on quality of life-related outcomes in both young and old patients with Parkinson's disease, is likely to generate considerable controversy regarding the use of dopamine agonists and the choice of initial therapy. In total, 1620 patients with early Parkinson's disease were recruited and given one of three initial treatment regimens. The study started in 2000 with a median follow-up of 3 years and maximum of 7 years. During this time the dopamine agonists varied, including ergot agonists that are no longer in widespread use. The randomization to levodopa or alternative regimens was at the discretion of the clinician and a large part of the study was conducted in centers for the care of the elderly. The findings suggest relatively small but persistent benefits of starting therapy with levodopa rather than the listed alternatives. Interestingly, initial treatment with a MAOB inhibitor appeared to be at least as effective as treatment with a dopamine agonist. Patients assigned to the levodopa arm scored, on average, 1.8 points (95% CI 0.5-3.0) higher on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) mobility subscale than those assigned to levodopa-sparing therapies; however, the effects on non-motor aspects of the scale are unclear. A cost-utility analysis of the study will be reported separately. If levodopa is used and the dose is titrated to the response, most patients initially need 50-100 mg three times daily to produce a consistent effect without fluctuations. Within 2-3 years, most will need a more frequent dosage to avoid fluctuations; smaller, more frequent doses (every 2-3 hours) often lead to an overall increase in dose. COMT inhibitors or dopamine agonists can, however, be introduced instead of increasing the frequency of levodopa. Monitoring. Scales for monitoring Parkinson's disease, and thus the response to treatment, include.","Levodopa restores the dopamine lost due to degeneration of striatonigral cells; patients with typical Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa almost immediately. Fear over the toxicity of levodopa has resulted in levodopa phobia in some patients; however, there is no robust evidence to suggest that levodopa is toxic to the human nigrostriatal pathway and these fears have mostly been discredited. Dopamine agonists are useful for smoothing the 'on/off' fluctuations secondary to levodopa therapy; some, such as rotigotine, may offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation in practice and specifically offer night-time and early morning benefit. Impuse control disorders have emerged as a major complication of mostly dopamine agonist treatment, and monitoring is a must. Treatment decisions should be based on the degree of disability, occupational needs, age, patient/clinician preference and adherence issues; neuroprotection remains a theoretical argument, while dyskinesias and wearing off are an important consideration in younger patients. The findings of the PDLIFE study suggest that early initiation of treatment may be beneficial in terms of health-related quality of life. The treatment of non-motor symptoms is important at all stages of Parkinson's disease. The results of the PANDA study may help people with Parkinson's-associated pain. Trial data indicate that treatment of Parkinson's disease could be initiated with levodopa, oral dopamine agonists or a monoamine oxidase B (MAOB) inhibitor. The PD MED study seems to suggest that initial therapy with levodopa offers a small but persistent benefit compared with the alternatives, and initial MAOB inhibitor treatment is at least as effective as a dopamine agonist.","Levodopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylation in the brain (Figure 4.1), but this can also occur outside the blood-brain barrier, leading to side effects such as nausea and postural hypotension. Chronic therapy with levodopa, however, results in motor fluctuations and dyskinesias due to Parkinson's disease progression coupled with the short half-life of levodopa. Ropinirole and pramipexole are well-established non-ergot dopamine agonists in widespread clinical use in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. The lifetime prevalence of ICDs, as reported by patients attending specialized clinics, is between 3 and 8%, although the DOMINION study reported a higher rate of 13.7% with ICDs, including problem/pathological gambling (5%), compulsive sexual behavior (3.5%), compulsive buying (5.7%) and binge-eating disorder (4.3%). Different international guidelines (NICE, AAN, EFNS/MDS-ES) all agree that there is no single universal first choice of drug for people with Parkinson's disease, particularly in the early stages of the condition. Individual choice of drug will be influenced, for example, by the degree of motor disability (if severe, the first choice is likely to be levodopa), occupational needs, the risk of motor complications (more common in younger patients, which would be delayed by agonists), neuropsychiatric complications (more common than older and cognitively impaired patients, so agonists should be avoided), patient/clinician preferences and adherence issues. The results of four controlled dopamine-agonist monotherapy trials have been published and suggest that initiation of treatment with an agonist is beneficial in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The results of four controlled dopamine-agonist monotherapy trials have been published and suggest that initiation of treatment with an agonist is beneficial in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. If levodopa is used and the dose is titrated to the response, most patients initially need 50-100 mg three times daily to produce a consistent effect without fluctuations.",40.75235109717868,49.808429118773944,44.827586206896555,13.522012578616351,16.538461538461537,14.878892733564014,19.122257053291534,23.371647509578544,21.03448275862069,78.43655347824097,96.57648801803589
9781908541727,ch03,"Blurred vision. The most common causes of blurred vision are refractive error (in the young) and cataract (in the elderly). However, blurred vision can also be the presenting symptom of potentially blinding intraocular disease such as retinal detachment, or potentially fatal extraocular disease such as vasculitis, brain tumor or stroke. It is essential to be able to clinically triage your patients with blurred vision into the majority for whom routine written referral to an ophthalmologist is appropriate and the minority who require urgent referral (to be seen the same day). Delay in referral of urgent cases, of even a few days, can cost the patient their sight. Patients with none of the features requiring urgent referral may be referred routinely, but should be advised to contact you if there are any major changes in their symptoms while they are waiting to be seen by the ophthalmologist. Causes of acute visual loss. Patients suspected of having any of the diseases outlined in this section should be referred urgently, as immediate ophthalmic medical or surgical treatment may be able to recover or stabilize sight. Retinal detachment. The retina lines the inner aspect of the back wall of the eye and consists of specialist cells called rods and cones (photoreceptors). These cells convert the focused light falling upon the retina to electrical energy to send to the brain to give us vision. The retina also contains the retinal pigment epithelium, which lies beneath the photoreceptors and helps them function, and the neural connections above the photoreceptors which form the optic nerve. Chronic glaucoma causes slow, painless loss of vision, which is usually not noticed by the patient because peripheral vision is lost first. Central vision loss signifies severe disease and can occur if the condition is not detected early by routine population screening. Chronic glaucoma is common, and risk increases with age. People with a family history of glaucoma are at increased risk and may develop the disease at a younger age. Regular examination by an optometrist every 2 years is recommended from the age of 40 to look for signs of glaucoma. If there is a strong family history of glaucoma, annual examination from an earlier age may be required. The examination should include an eye pressure test, optic disc examination and automated visual fields. The eyes of a patient with chronic glaucoma appear entirely normal on examination, apart from raised intraocular pressure (in most but not all patients) and characteristic 'cupping' of one or both optic discs (Figure 3.7). Do not confuse this condition with acute glaucoma, which is much rarer and presents with a painful red eye and blurred vision (see Chapter 2). Diabetic maculopathy. All of your practice's diabetic patients should be enrolled for regular (usually annual) diabetic retinopathy screening. The right time to treat diabetic maculopathy (or proliferative retinopathy) is in its early stages, before it becomes symptomatic. Laser treatments, slow-release steroid injections and anti-VEGF injections are used for this condition. Patients who have advanced diabetic maculopathy that has not been detected by screening complain of blurred vision and metamorphopsia. Early diabetic maculopathy is very difficult to see with the direct ophthalmoscope, particularly without the aid of dilating drops. Advanced cases may show microaneurysms (small red dots) and hard exudates (yellow lipid deposits from leaky microaneurysms) at or near the macula (Figure 3.8). 'Dry' age-related macular degeneration ('dry' AMD). In the elderly, age-related changes in the macula often cause gradual, usually mild-to-moderate, loss of vision, although in some cases it can also cause severe visual loss. In the early stages of macular degeneration patients are aware that they need more light to read and it takes longer to adjust from light to dark environments and vice versa. Patients complain of increasing difficulty reading and blurred central vision with preserved peripheral vision. The macula is very difficult to examine with the direct ophthalmoscope, especially if dilating drops are not used, but drusen (small yellow spots from the waste products of cell metabolism) or areas of pigment atrophy and/or black pigment clumps may be seen (Figure 3.9). Superimposed on this gradual decline of vision, a minority of patients also experience a sudden loss of central vision with distortion due to the development of 'wet' AMD.","Most patients with blurred vision have benign, slowly progressive conditions and can be referred routinely to an ophthalmologist. However, blurred vision may also be the first symptom of potentially sight- or life-threatening disease, and patients suspected of having a serious cause of blurred vision must be referred urgently. All people over 40 should be encouraged to have regular eye checks by their optometrist to look for early signs of glaucoma and other eye disease. Chronic glaucoma is usually asymptomatic until it is very advanced. Please check that all your practice's diabetic patients are enrolled for regular eye screening to detect diabetic eye disease. Diabetic retinopathy is best treated at an asymptomatic stage to prevent visual loss. Always consider temporal arteritis if a patient over 50 complains of sudden loss of vision or transient blurring of vision.","It is essential to be able to clinically triage your patients with blurred vision into the majority for whom routine written referral to an ophthalmologist is appropriate and the minority who require urgent referral (to be seen the same day).

9781908541024,ch_12,"The vast majority of primary brain tumors occur sporadically, but a small number appear to be familial. The etiology of sporadic brain tumors is unknown, but environmental factors are suspected. Most patients with a family history of primary brain tumors have a hereditary disease that is known to be associated with such tumors, such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, familial polyposis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome. However, some patients do not have any underlying or obvious hereditary disorder that would predispose them to primary brain tumors, but nevertheless give a striking history of these tumors in first-degree relatives. Usually, the tumors are found to be high-grade gliomas. Although it is feasible that germline abnormalities could lead to the development of primary brain tumors in these families, there are a number of unusual demographic features suggesting an environmental rather than genetic explanation for brain tumor clustering. Most cases of confirmed familial cancers are multigenerational, and affected individuals are younger than average for the tumor. However, brain tumor families who do not have one of the recognized hereditary diseases usually involve parent-child and sibling-sibling cases; it is rare for more than two generations to be involved. In addition, the demographics suggest environmental rather than genetic causes in the parent-child and sibling-sibling clusters. These observations suggest that familial exposure to an environmental toxin or ionizing radiation may account for the clustering of primary brain tumors in these families. It is important for clinicians to enquire about any family history of brain tumors, and to be aware of the major syndromes with neoplastic manifestations in the nervous system, so that these diagnoses are not missed. Recognizing a familial brain tumor syndrome is valuable for appropriate patient surveillance for another occult brain tumor or associated disease, for screening family members, and for genetic counseling. Most patients presenting with primary brain tumors will, however, be sporadic cases and the etiology will remain unknown.

Several types of lesion, often cystic in nature, may be mistaken for a primary intracranial tumor and must therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of suggestive MRI abnormalities (Table 11.1). Dermoid and epidermoid cysts account for about 1% of intracranial tumors and are most often found at the base of the brain, fourth ventricle or spine. They are midline tumors that arise from fetal neural and ectodermal tissues. There may be direct communication with the skin via a midline dermal tract. Rathke cleft cysts are usually small asymptomatic abnormalities found on MRI. They can arise in either the sellar or suprasellar region, with 70% of these cysts bridging these two compartments. The lack of calcification may help to distinguish these cysts from craniopharyngiomas. Rarely, Rathke cleft cysts cause pituitary dysfunction, headache or visual disturbance; in these cases, surgical resection is appropriate. Recurrence is rare. Arachnoid cysts are congenital malformations that are typically found in a superficial location, but may be intraventricular (Figure 11.7). They are usually asymptomatic, but occasionally have sufficient mass effect to cause headaches or seizures. Symptomatic lesions should be surgically drained. Neurenteric cysts are congenital epithelial cysts that occur in the spinal canal or posterior fossa. Most are asymptomatic; those causing compression or obstructing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be resected or diverted.

9781908541420,ch_6,"Inhaled corticosteroids, such as beclometasone (beclomethasone) dipropionate, budesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone, fluticasone furoate and ciclesonide, are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents currently available for asthma management. They are the mainstay of effective asthma treatment, improving symptoms and preventing exacerbations, and their use is associated with protection from asthma deaths. Studies have consistently shown that these agents reduce pathological signs of airway inflammation, so that lung function and symptoms improve, bronchial hyperresponsiveness decreases, and the frequency and severity of exacerbations are reduced. Corticosteroids interrupt the signaling pathways for pro-inflammatory molecules by decreasing the expression of genes for a variety of inflammatory mediators and by increasing the expression of genes for anti-inflammatory mediators. Relievers (sometimes referred to as rescue medication) are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks (see Table 4.2). They include SABAs, LABAs with a rapid onset of action, short-acting theophylline and short-acting anticholinergic agents. The most effective forms are those that are delivered by inhalation directly to the airways. Short-acting beta -agonists. Inhaled SABAs, such as salbutamol and terbutaline, are used to control bronchoconstriction, and are the treatment of choice for the management of acute exacerbations and the prophylaxis of exercise-induced asthma. Oral preparations are also available and may be suitable for patients who are unable to use inhaled medication. In general, oral administration is less desirable than inhaled administration because systemic side effects such as tachycardia are more pronounced when the drug is delivered orally. Concern has been expressed over the long-term safety of repeatedly inhaling short-acting beta -bronchodilators. Several points are worth making in relation to the use of these quick relievers. They are certainly the best drugs for relieving acute bronchospasm and associated symptoms, but their increased use by a patient is a sign of worsening asthma and the need for greater use of controller (preventer) drugs. The use of one canister of a metered-dose inhaler per month should certainly sound alarm bells. Regular use of SABAs is not recommended, as a refractory response may develop, and it has been suggested that asthma may worsen. In addition, it is now known that genetic beta -adrenoceptor polymorphisms influence the effectiveness of these drugs, particularly with regard to tachyphylaxis or the development of refractoriness; therefore SABAs should only be used for quick relief on an 'as-required' basis. The second aim of asthma control is prevention of exacerbations. While achieving control of asthma symptoms is likely to lead to prevention of exacerbations in most, for some patients asthma exacerbations are the predominant feature of their asthma. As asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening and are inevitably disruptive to patients and their carers, in these instances prevention of exacerbations should be the major focus of treatment. Factors indicating a high risk for future exacerbations include a past history of severe or life-threatening asthma attack, exacerbation occurring despite adequate preventative treatment, impaired interval lung function and cigarette smoke exposure. Current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma treatment, depending on disease control (Table 4.5), in both adults and children (Figure 4.6). All patients should aim to have well-controlled asthma, and treatment should be stepped up or down, as appropriate, every 1-3 months to achieve and maintain asthma control. Recommended management strategies suggest five treatment steps. Patients should be started on therapy appropriate to the initial level of symptoms: step 2 is appropriate for most patients who are receiving no, or only as-needed, bronchodilator treatment for asthma, and step 3 is appropriate for those with more uncontrolled symptoms and reduced lung function at the start of treatment. Depending on symptom severity and the presence of exacerbations, treatment should be continued at a given level for 1-3 months before considering escalation or reduction. Generally, after 3 months of well-controlled asthma a step down to a lower level of treatment should be considered. Step 5. The highest level of treatment, step 5, involves the addition of oral corticosteroid treatment and/or anti-IgE therapy for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of high-dose controller inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs. Such unresponsive asthma symptoms should prompt a consideration of the diagnosis of asthma and the exclusion of other factors that may be worsening asthma. It is also appropriate to seek specialist referral at this stage. Oral corticosteroids should be used at the lowest dose and for the minimum time required to gain asthma symptom control. Immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, tacrolimus and azathioprine are occasionally used as oral corticosteroid-sparing agents. Written treatment plan. All patients with asthma should have a written plan that describes their current step of asthma treatment and advises on treatment adjustments to accommodate worsening asthma (see Chapter 6). For many patients, such a plan will also involve instructions to take oral corticosteroids or seek medical advice for prescription of oral corticosteroid treatment.","Controllers (exempli gratia inhaled corticosteroids) are the mainstay of asthma therapy. Increased use of relievers (short-acting beta -agonists) indicates inadequate disease control. Drugs used in the management of asthma can be classified as controllers (preventers) or relievers: controllers are taken daily on a long-term basis to control persistent asthma; relievers are used to rapidly reverse the bronchoconstriction and associated symptoms during acute attacks. Asthma therapy should be tailored to disease severity; current management guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to treatment. If recommended treatment fails, adherence and diagnosis should be re-examined before treatment is escalated. Any exacerbation should prompt a review of maintenance medications.

9781908541680,ch_8,"Behavioral therapy - the collective name for the various methods and strategies used to bring about changes in lifestyle - is universally credited as being one of the three main pillars of weight management, alongside dietary modification and increased physical activity (Chapters 5 and). Bringing about a change in behavior is an important part of clinical care; the ability to foster such change in patients is fundamental to the skill base of any health professional. Changing patients' habits and attitudes using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is key to long-term obesity management. Goal setting: the agreement of realistic weight-loss targets, at a realistic rate of improvement. Self-monitoring: increasing self-awareness of eating patterns and physical activity behavior, which is an essential precursor for change. Stimulus control: avoiding situations that lead to harmful behavior, and promoting situations that influence healthy activity. A food and activity diary should clarify eating patterns and behaviors, particularly events that trigger eating, with a view to changing those patterns once they have been identified, for instance by planning ahead. Once the pattern of eating has been established, the diary can be used as part of the treatment plan, by recording progress towards dietary goals. Long-term weight management has been shown to improve when food records are used. Binge eating disorder (BED) is specifically recognized in its own right in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the broadly accepted manual for mental illness classification, published by the American Psychiatric Association. Patients with BED display the features of bulimia nervosa but without the purging, abnormal exercise regimens or other compensatory behavior to induce weight loss (see also Fast Facts: Eating Disorders). The condition was largely ignored when it was first recognized in 1959 but has recently gained greater prominence.","Behavioral therapy, alongside diet and lifestyle advice, is one of the three key components of obesity management. Techniques include goal setting, self-monitoring and stimulus control. A person's degree of motivation and expectations should be assessed.

This may transiently reduce PSA, but the PSA will usually start to rise again relatively soon. Withdrawal of the antiandrogen at this time produces a favorable PSA response in approximately 40% of men for 4-6 months. This phenomenon has been ascribed to a mutation affecting androgen receptors in malignant tissue which means that the antiandrogen acts as an agonist (stimulatory) rather than an antagonist (blocker), so when the antiandrogen is withdrawn the stimulation is reduced; a similar phenomenon occurs in breast cancer treated with antiestrogens. As long as the patient is asymptomatic, the addition and withdrawal of different antiandrogens can be continued for 2-3 cycles, as previous antiandrogen administration does not appear to diminish the response to different antiandrogens.

Cabazitaxel. This taxane chemotherapy was developed to overcome the resistance that can develop as a result of docetaxel treatment. In the TROPIC study, men with CRPC that had progressed after docetaxel treatment were randomized to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone. Those who received cabazitaxel demonstrated a 30% improvement in survival compared with those receiving mitoxantrone (15.1 versus 12.7 months; Figure 8.6 and see Table 8.1). Side effects were similar to those seen with docetaxel. Mitoxantrone and prednisone was the first chemotherapy combination to be tested in a randomized trial in advanced prostate cancer. The combination was very well tolerated and more than doubled the time of palliation response compared with prednisone alone. It also improved the quality of life of men with CRPC. It has now been replaced by docetaxel as first-line chemotherapy and by cabazitaxel as second-line chemotherapy, which have better efficacy; however, the combination still has a place in second-line therapy when resistance to docetaxel has developed and cabazitaxel is not an option. Abiraterone. In a study in men with metastatic CRPC for whom docetaxel chemotherapy had failed, abiraterone plus prednisone resulted in a 35% improvement in survival compared with prednisone alone (see Table 8.1). Mineralocorticoid-related adverse events, including fluid retention, hypertension and hypokalemia, were more frequent in the abiraterone group, highlighting the continuing dependency of CRPC on androgen-receptor signaling even after it has become castrate resistant (see Table 8.1). Palliative radiotherapy. Hormone-naïve disease is initially managed with ADT. However, some men do not get full resolution of pain, or may have painful bone metastases in the setting of CRPC. Focal external-beam radiotherapy is a well-established treatment, providing rapid improvement in pain in up to 80% of men. Treatment can be given as either a single fraction or as multiple fractions over 2-3 weeks. This type of irradiation is associated with very few side effects. Bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption and demineralization, providing symptomatic benefit in some patients. A study involving over 600 men with CRPC demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of patients with bone-related events among those receiving zoledronic acid (zoledronate), given as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks, compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid also significantly delayed the onset of first skeletal-related event (see Table 8.1); however, the number needed to treat (NNT) to save one death is 10. Side effects with bisphosphonates include renal deterioration and, rarely, osteonecrosis of the jaw. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand); it inhibits osteoclast function and bone turnover. A randomized trial involving 1904 men with CRPC supported denosumab as the optimal medication to reduce bone-related events in men with CRPC (see Table 8.1).","After an initial response to androgen ablation, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value starts to rise as a result of androgen-insensitive cell clones. As an initial step, withdraw any antiandrogen, then consider trying another antiandrogen. The mainstay of management for metastatic CRPC is docetaxel chemotherapy. The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone is now also licensed for use before chemotherapy, and trials of other antiandrogens prior to chemotherapy are under way. Immunotherapy for CRPC may be best implemented before significant symptoms appear. When docetaxel chemotherapy has failed, second-line therapies such as cabazitaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone (a selective inhibitor of androgen biosynthesis), enzalutamide (an androgen-receptor-signaling inhibitor) and radium-223 (targeted alpha therapy) have been shown to improve survival and quality of life. External-beam radiotherapy may provide useful control of pain from bone metastases. The monoclonal antibody denosumab and the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid have been reported to significantly delay bone-related events in men with metastatic prostate cancer.","Withdrawal of the antiandrogen at this time produces a favorable PSA response in approximately 40% of men for 4-6 months.

9781910797815,chp7,"Pacritinib is an inhibitor of both JAK2 and FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), an enzyme that is important in the development of the hematopoietic and immune systems. The efficacy of this agent in patients with myelofibrosis has been evaluated in two randomized Phase III trials: PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2. PERSIST-1 excluded patients who had previously received JAK2 inhibitors whereas such patients were eligible to enter PERSIST-2. In PERSIST-1, the primary endpoint was at least 35% reduction in spleen volume, and a secondary endpoint was at least 50% reduction in total symptom scores; these were co-primary endpoints in PERSIST-2. Both trials showed pacritinib to be superior to best available therapy in terms of spleen and symptom responses. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhea and vomiting) and hematologic (anemia and thrombocytopenia). Many therapies targeting diverse molecular targets are currently being investigated in myelofibrosis (Table 7.1). PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The JAK2/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is an indirect activator of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B)/mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) pathway, inhibitors of which have been shown to dose-dependently inhibit the proliferation of cell lines with JAK2 V617F mutations, and to reduce clonogenic activity in hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with MPNs. Everolimus, which inhibits the mTOR kinase TORC1, has been shown to inhibit proliferation in JAK2 V617F-mutated cell lines when administered alone or in combination with JAK2 inhibitors, and produced a response rate of 23% in a Phase I/II study in patients with myelofibrosis. The PI3K inhibitor buparlisib (BKM120) was not effective in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with myelofibrosis. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as decitabine and azacitidine may be effective in patients with MPN with signs of leukemic transformation (see Chapter 9). - These agents have also been evaluated in combination with ruxolitinib in the treatment of myelofibrosis but to date there is no clear evidence that combination therapy improves efficacy. Hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Hedgehog is a signaling pathway required for cell differentiation. Abnormalities in hedgehog pathway signaling have been described in animal models of myelofibrosis but most trials with inhibitors of this pathway in patients with MPN have not shown any benefit. However, some efficacy was seen with glasdegib in a recent Phase Ib/II trial involving 21 patients with myelofibrosis previously treated with JAK inhibitors: five patients had reductions in spleen volume and one showed improvement in anemia and became transfusion-independent. BET inhibitors. Bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitors bind to the bromodomain of the BET proteins, BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT, blocking their interaction with acetylated histones and transcription factors. These proteins are examples of 'epigenetic readers' and have been implicated in various hematologic malignancies, prompting trials of BET inhibitors. Early studies also suggest that use of a BET inhibitor in combination with a targeted therapy may prevent resistance. However, the BET proteins have distinct transcriptional pathways, and selectivity may be a challenge in clinical development.","The Janus kinase 2 inhibitor pacritinib was superior to best available therapy in patients with myelofibrosis in terms of spleen and symptom responses. A variety of new therapies directed against diverse molecular targets are currently being evaluated. Other potential therapeutic targets include signaling pathways, histone deacetylase, telomerase, DNA methyltransferase and blockade of erythropoietin inhibitors. The use of ruxolitinib in combination with new therapies may offer a further potential approach to treatment.","PERSIST-1 excluded patients who had previously received JAK2 inhibitors whereas such patients were eligible to enter PERSIST-2.

9783318066685,ch4,"4 Gene therapies with proven clinical efficacy. Several gene therapy drugs are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to be marketed as medicines (Table 4.1). Others have shown strong efficacy in early clinical studies and are therefore being evaluated in Phase III trials. Examples of gene therapies with track records of clinical efficacy are described in the following sections and summarized in Table 4.2. Hereditary blindness. Prior to gene therapy, no treatment was available for certain forms of hereditary blindness. However, the ability of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to transduce retinal cells on subretinal administration has enabled the development of therapies for such diseases. This effort ultimately led to the first gene therapy drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of a genetic disease in late 2017. Leber congenital amaurosis. In Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2), mutations in the RPE65 gene prevent the expression of retinal pigment epithelium 65 kDa protein (RPE65), thereby impairing the process of visual photo-transduction and severely limiting vision. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. Affected infants typically already have decreased visual responsiveness at birth. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disease that causes death in infants. Loss of motor neurons leads to progressive muscle wasting, initially affecting arm, leg and respiratory muscles. The disease is caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene, which is autosomal recessive and encodes survival of motor neuron 1, telomeric (SMN1), a protein necessary for motor neuron survival. The SMN1 protein is important for the biogenesis and assembly of small nuclear ribonucleic particles (snRNPs), which are critical in messenger (m)RNA splicing (spliceosome assembly and pre-mRNA splicing). While SMN1 is ubiquitously expressed, its loss is particularly detrimental to motor neurons. Without functional motor neurons, the central nervous system (CNS) is unable to send signals to skeletal muscles, and babies born with this defect gradually become paralyzed. To correct this devastating defect, a gene therapy was developed based on systemic delivery of high doses of AAV9 expressing functional SMN1. This vector is capable of transducing motor neurons and effectively transduces the spinal cord after systemic administration. Moreover, it is also able to cross the blood-brain barrier and transduce cells in the brains of rhesus macaques, even in animals up to 3 years old. Nonetheless, it is thought that the most effective reversal of disease can be achieved early in life. Remarkably, all 15 babies treated by this gene therapy in the initial clinical trial are alive at age 20 months or older (these patients were expected to die within the first 2 years of life). Most can sit up, and some are even able to walk. The FDA has approved the systemic AAV gene therapy for SMN1-deficient children up to the age of 2 years. After preclinical efficacy and long-term follow-up studies in hemophilic mice and dogs and in non-human primates, followed by a series of early Phase I/II clinical trials and further preclinical development, there are now several AAV vectors in advanced clinical development for hemophilia. They all utilize hepatocyte-specific promoters but differ in capsid and also utilize different methods for vector production (such as transient transfection of human cells or baculovirus infection of insect cells). For FIX production, efficacy has been further improved by incorporation of a naturally occurring variant (FIX-Padua) that has an approximately eightfold higher enzymatic activity. Such vectors raised coagulation activity in patients with severe disease to around 30-50% of usual levels, close to the lower limit of the normal range. Thus, patients typically no longer require factor infusions, and dramatic reductions in annual bleeding rates (mostly none) are reported. These therapeutic benefits have persisted for at least 3 years, with more follow-up data pending. Notably, patients treated in an earlier trial with an AAV vector expressing FIX without the Padua mutation reached levels above 5% of normal that were sustained for at least 8 years. Two products expressing FIX-Padua have been developed. These are now being evaluated in Phase III clinical trials. Differences include capsids, vector genomes/expression cassette design, manufacturing systems and reported vector doses. CAR-T therapy for lymphoma and leukemia. Adoptive lymphocyte therapy using gene-modified autologous T cells is one of the technologies revolutionizing cancer therapy. T cells are harvested from the patient's blood and transduced with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) by ex vivo gene transfer using retroviral or lentiviral vectors (Figure 4.3). Early success has been shown with blood cancers. In pioneering work, CAR-T cells directed against the CD19 antigen were able to effectively kill lymphoma cells from patients refractory to conventional chemotherapy. CAR-T cells targeting CD19 are now approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of several types of blood cancer. These include: relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children and young adults; and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in adults.

These include: relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in children and young adults; and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in adults. CARs have a modular design and comprise an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv, the extracellular binding domain that targets the intact tumor surface antigen), a hinge region, a transmembrane domain and intracellular signaling domains. Expression of the CAR re-directs the T cells to the tumor antigen and provides the signals required for T-cell activation on binding to the antigen. Importantly, targeting of the intact antigen via scFv binding is neither MHC restricted nor dependent on co-receptors or epitope processing. CARs are broadly classified by the number of co-stimulatory domains that have been incorporated into the intracellular portion of the molecule. First-generation CARs contained only CD3zed chain, while second- or third-generation CARs have CD3zed plus one or more co-stimulatory domains, respectively (Figure 4.4). Current commercial designs are based on second-generation CARs. Future (fourth) generation CARs are being developed with inducible signaling.","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapies for Leber congenital amaurosis and spinal muscular atrophy are now approved medicines in the USA and rely on in vivo injection to, respectively, the subretinal space and systemic circulation. After initial setbacks, hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy, primarily based on lentiviral vectors, is being successfully developed for primary immune deficiencies and some lysosomal storage disorders. Globin disorders are a major next target for this approach. Multiple gene therapies for hemophilia, based on hepatic AAV gene transfer, have elevated coagulation factor activities in patients to the normal or near normal range. These are now being evaluated in Phase III trials. Gene therapy, using gene-modified cells or in vivo gene transfer, has now been successful for diverse diseases and modes of gene transfer. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies for blood cancers, targeting the CD19 antigen, are in use to treat relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in adults and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and young adults.","Several gene therapy drugs are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to be marketed as medicines (Table 4.1).

9781908541680,ch_4,"Definition of the metabolic syndrome is of value because it ensures that any patient with a single cardiovascular risk factor, including obesity, is screened for the others, as their presence is statistically highly likely and coexistent cardiometabolic risks multiply the overall risk. It also ensures that a patient with multiple risk factors, even those considered borderline, is managed as a high-risk individual. The aim of management is to tackle the syndrome as a whole, and obesity in particular. Management of single or even multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, for example hypertension or hyperlipidemia alone, or even the combination of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension, is insufficient; the fundamental issues of excess and pathologically distributed body fat, exercise deficiency and a nutritionally poor diet require attention.

Is weight loss always beneficial? Obesity, particularly when severe, is associated with an increase in mortality. The Framingham Heart Study estimated a reduced life expectancy of 5.8 and 7.1 years in 40-year-old obese men and women (non-smokers), respectively. The lowest mortalities occur in people who are normal weight or overweight and remain weight stable. For people who are overweight, gaining more weight increases mortality. Weight loss in cohort studies, particularly in older populations, has been associated with an increase in all-cause mortality but these data may be confounded by individuals with unintentional weight loss caused by an underlying disease process. Conversely, in controlled clinical trials, 5% weight loss as part of a healthy lifestyle intervention in people over the age of 65 has been associated with a reduction in mortality. It appears, therefore, that weight loss in and of itself may not necessarily confer benefit independent of an underlying condition, or adopting healthy eating behaviors and regular physical activity. The lag phase between the onset of uncomplicated obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m) and the development of diabetes can be 10-12 years. However, the underlying pathological changes are already developing when the patient is overweight, even though outward signs and symptoms may remain undetected, and therefore the possibility of disordered glucose metabolism must be considered and looked for. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease. Moreover, recent data have clearly shown that aggressive early management confers the best chance to prevent, or at the very least substantially delay, both progression of the disease and emergence of cardiovascular and other complications. Once complications are established very tight control is less beneficial. Also see Fast Facts: Diabetes Mellitus. Mechanism of obesity-related hypertension. Increased renal sodium reabsorption and blood volume expansion are central features in the development of obesity-related hypertension. Hyperinsulinemia leads to renal salt retention. Overweight is also associated with increased sympathetic activity, an effect that may be mediated by leptin, a protein expressed in and secreted by adipocytes (see Chapter 2). The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has also been causally implicated in obesity-related hypertension, partly because of activation by increased sympathetic activity, and perhaps also because angiotensinogen is expressed in and secreted by adipose tissue. Low levels of the adipocyte-derived cytokine adiponectin, high circulating levels of free fatty acids and increased vascular production of endothelin-1 have also been implicated in mediating the effect of obesity to increase blood pressure, although recent studies have suggested that BMI, in the absence of diabetes, does not affect plasma adiponectin levels.","Obesity significantly affects cardiometabolic status and risk. The metabolic syndrome defines the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors under the umbrella of obesity. Weight loss rapidly and effectively reduces cardiovascular risk and the burden of atrial fibrillation, and improves cardiac function. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the comorbidity most closely linked with obesity. Weight loss prevents the disease in those at risk and improves glycemic control when it is present. Lipid disorders and hypertension are exacerbated by obesity and add to cardiovascular risk.","Management of single or even multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, for example hypertension or hyperlipidemia alone, or even the combination of hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension, is insufficient; the fundamental issues of excess and pathologically distributed body fat, exercise deficiency and a nutritionally poor diet require attention.
