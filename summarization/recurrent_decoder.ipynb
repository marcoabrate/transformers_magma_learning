      "the breast . Since over 90% of breast cancers are first detected by the woman herself, the rationale for regular self-examination is to increase the\n",
      "likelihood of detecting a tumor as early as possible . Screening by regular mammography can reduce the risk of mortality from breast cancer by 20-30%\n",
      "in certain groups . Significant benefits are, however, seen only in women over the age of 50 years . In trials in Sweden, for example, mortality\n",

      "investigations are undertaken . For every breast cancer detected, a substantial number of women will undergo biopsies or surgery for benign breast\n",
      "disease, with attendant morbidity . Although the total dose of radiation received during mammography is low (< 1.5 mGy), it has been suggested that\n",
      "repeated exposure could increase the risk of breast cancer . This risk is, however, low . It has been estimated that screening 2 million women over 50\n",

      "breast cancer in women over 60 years of age is approximately 2000 cases/million . Small breast cancers detected by mammography may be biologically\n",
      "different from those detected clinically . Approximately 20% of cancers detected by mammography are carcinomas in situ, of which some would never\n",
      "progress to invasive disease if left undetected, and the optimal treatment for such tumors is unknown . If these cancers are treated in the same way\n",
      "as invasive cancers, some women may undergo unnecessarily extensive surgery . Conversely, in other women, delaying treatment of asymptomatic disease\n",
      "may ultimately compromise the chance of cure . Furthermore, there is good evidence that screening leads to overdiagnosis . Many invasive cancers\n",
      "detected by screening would never have progressed to clinical disease .  For every 2000 women screened for 10 years, 43 (vs 33 if not screened)\n",
      "cancers would be diagnosed . This means that 10 additional cancers will be diagnosed, resulting in about 3 fewer deaths (10 deaths instead of 13) from\n",
      "breast cancer . Even though some calculations suggest that this number could be 1 rather than 3, many women may choose to take this risk of\n",
      "overdiagnosis for the benefit of reduction in mortality, particularly if the treatments are made less intrusive . For example, the UK Marmot committee\n",
      "has recommended a single dose of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) concurrent with lumpectomy, which has been found to be as effective for\n",
      "cancer control as several weeks of whole breast radiotherapy, while reducing deaths from other causes such as cardiovascular and other cancers . The\n",

      "radical surgery or, at the very least, a lifetime of uncertainty and anxiety for the patient . In 2001, the Canadian Medical Association went one step\n",
      "further when it published new guidelines following a systematic review of the literature . As a public health measure, self-examination was relegated\n",

      "the disappointing results with early diagnostic attempts, including both imaging and self-examination, probably reflect our incomplete understanding\n",

      "on very limited data . Not only does physical exercise appear to be beneficial for depression, it also has the important additional advantage of\n",
      "delivering health gains in other areas . Although encouragement of any increase in physical activity is likely to be useful for people with\n",
      "depression, current evidence indicates that a regular program of activity is necessary for maintenance of effects . The most recent () NICE guidance\n",
      "notes that a typical intervention is likely to involve supervised exercise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, undertaken two to three times each week for 10-14\n",
      "weeks . Given the lack of evidence of superiority of particular kinds of physical activity or modes of delivery, it seems reasonable to encourage\n",

      "and resources to improve their functioning . The treatment usually consists of six sessions, the first of which lasts 1 hour, with subsequent half-\n",
      "hour sessions . It is based on establishing a link between current problems and psychological functioning; success in solving and establishing control\n",
      "over these problems is associated with improvement in depressive symptoms .  Important strengths of this approach are its brevity, accessibility and\n",
      "feasibility for delivery by a range of professionals and paraprofessionals within primary care . Several studies have supported the effectiveness of\n",
      "PST in primary care, but the extent and robustness of the evidence are limited . A recent trial of PST delivered by community mental health nurses\n",
      "compared with usual physician-led primary care found no significant differences in effectiveness . A systematic review of psychosocial interventions\n",
      "delivered in primary care by primary care physicians indicated that this approach was the most promising . Relaxation training . A variety of\n",
      "techniques are available for inducing relaxation, including progressive muscle relaxation, relaxation imagery, autogenic training and methods adapted\n",
      "from yoga and meditation . These approaches are generally well received by clients, with low drop-out rates evident in studies . One 2008 systematic\n",
      "review (which included 11 trials in the meta-analysis) indicated that relaxation training was more effective at reducing self-rated depressive\n",
      "symptoms than waiting-list, no-treatment or minimal-treatment controls, although outcome measurement by clinician-rated depressive symptoms provided\n",
      "inconclusive differences . Relaxation is less effective than established psychotherapies such as CBT but, because it requires only brief training, it\n",

      "depression, occurring in around three-quarters of episodes; it is also a common prodromal feature of depression, preceding depressive episodes in\n",
      "about 40% of cases . It causes subjective distress and can aggravate other symptoms of depression . Assisting people with the sleep difficulties that\n",
      "form a part of the spectrum of depressive features is an important part of initial intervention . 'Sleep hygiene' relates to the promotion of sleep\n",
      "that is appropriately timed and effective . Good sleep hygiene involves adhering to all elements of sleep hygiene guidance (Table 6.3), with\n",
      "particular emphasis on the importance of getting up at the same time each day . Psychological approaches using the computer and internet . One of the\n",
      "main barriers to patients receiving appropriate psychological treatments, such as CBT or PST, is a shortage of clinicians who can deliver them .\n",
      "Additionally, there may be problems for individuals scheduling appointments with family, work or carer commitments . Internet-based CBT programs, such\n",
      "as MoodGym and the Sadness Program in Australia, make use of the same techniques as face-to-face therapy but these are delivered in a more accessible\n",
      "and cost-effective way via a website . Evaluations of a range of computer- and internet-based CBT programs indicate significant improvements in the\n",
      "symptoms of depression compared with control patients . There is some indication that improvements in symptoms are maintained over time (up to 12\n",
      "months) . The use of such innovations in delivery may be particularly useful in rural and remote settings where access to clinicians may be limited .\n",
      "Moderate and moderate to severe major depression . The main options for the treatment of moderate and severe depression involve pharmacological and\n",
      "psychological interventions . Treatment choice depends on judgments of severity, previous response to interventions and the person's preferences .\n",
      "Both pharmacological and psychological interventions increase response and remission to a similar extent compared with controls, and trials indicate\n",
      "an improvement for around two-thirds of those in any actively treated group . Lower rates of drop out from treatment are usually seen for\n",
      "psychological interventions . Pharmacological treatments . In the early 1950s the first antidepressant drugs were developed: the monoamine oxidase\n",
      "inhibitors (MAOIs) and, later, the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) . These drugs act by enhancement of neurotransmission of serotonin and\n",
      "norepinephrine (noradrenaline), as well as other neurotransmitters . Problematically, TCAs have marked anticholinergic and antihistamine effects, and\n",
      "are toxic in overdose, while MAOIs have interactions with foods containing tyramine (red wines, cheese, liver, yeast extract) that cause a potentially\n",
      "fatal hypertensive reaction . For this reason MAOIs are not commonly used, and are rarely prescribed in primary care; TCAs are more frequently used in\n",
      "primary and secondary care but, because of their interactions and side effects, they are contraindicated in a number of physical illnesses, in\n",
      "particular cardiac disease .  They are not recommended as a first-line treatment because of their side effects, interaction, and toxicity:\n",
      "importantly, TCAs should be avoided where there appears to be a risk of suicide because (except for lofepramine) they are associated with greatest\n",
      "risk in overdose . In the late 1980s, more selective drugs were developed with a primary focus of activity on the serotonergic system, giving rise to\n",
      "the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) . Drugs targeting the noradrenergic systems were also developed and antidepressants that combine\n",
      "action on both systems, the serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake inhibitors, are now available and may be more effective for more severe episodes of\n",
      "depression . New antidepressants are being researched and developed that better enhance neurotransmission and influence allied mechanisms; one example\n",
      "is agomelatine, which exploits the synergy between melatonergic agonism (MT1 and MT2 receptors) and serotonergic 5HT2c antagonism; the latter enhances\n",
      "the release of dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex . In addition, stimulation of MT1 and MT2 receptors causes resynchronization of\n",
      "circadian rhythms . Circadian rhythms ensure that we have the most energy and cognitive capacity during the daylight hours when we are at work, and\n",
      "low energy at night time when we sleep . Circadian rhythms are controlled by the circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and modulated\n",
      "by the hormone melatonin, which is only released during the dark . The circadian clock keeps us in tune with the external environment and the seasonal\n",
      "changes in the length of day (photoperiod), with daylight suppressing melatonin production . It is recognized that circadian rhythms become\n",
      "desynchronized in some forms of depression; for example, the common symptom of waking early in the morning and the changing mood throughout the day\n",
      "are most likely the result of the desynchronization of these daily rhythms . The synergistic action of agomelatine results in release of dopamine and\n",
      "norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex without increasing serotonin levels, providing the antidepressant efficacy without causing common serotonin-\n",
      "related side effects (sexual dysfunction, emotional blunting and a discontinuation syndrome) . Agomelatine can be used as a first-line treatment,\n",
      "especially when the depression is accompanied by sleep problems or poor hedonic drives . It can also be used for patients who have experienced\n",
      "emotional blunting or sexual dysfunction while on an SSRI or SNRI . Are antidepressants effective? Some recent reviews have questioned the extent of\n",
      "benefit of antidepressants, and there seems little doubt that, as in many other areas of medical treatment, publication bias (wherein studies with\n",
      "positive findings are most likely to be published) has led to an inflated view of antidepressant effectiveness . It also appears that pharmaceutical\n",
      "industry sponsorship of studies is linked to biases in the reporting of findings . Furthermore, in recent years, the difference in effect between\n",
      "antidepressant drugs and placebos in RCTs has been becoming smaller . This has led some clinicians to question the effectiveness of antidepressants .\n",
      "However, the diminishing drug-placebo difference is more likely to be related to clinical trial methodology, with selection of participants with\n",
      "milder episodes of depression that would be likely to have a high placebo response . Despite these important limitations, the majority of well-\n",
      "conducted meta-analyses provide evidence of the effectiveness of antidepressants for moderate and severe major depression, as well as for persistent\n",
      "subthreshold or mild depression . It seems, in general, that the more severe the symptoms, the greater the benefit of antidepressant treatment: this\n",
      "accords with general clinical experience, although there is conflicting research evidence about a relationship between medication response and symptom\n",
      "severity in moderate to severe depression . A very large number of studies have shown that, around 20% of people with depression of at least moderate\n",
      "severity, will improve without any treatment and 30% will respond to placebo treatment, while up to 50% will respond to antidepressant treatment .\n",
      "Choosing an antidepressant . In the USA, more than 40 antidepressant medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration are noted in current\n",
      "National Institute of Mental Health literature, while 29 are listed in the current British National Formulary . This diversity of treatment is not\n",
      "necessarily associated with increased effectiveness: there are relatively modest differences between the individual drugs or classes of drug . The\n",
      "main advantage from developments in antidepressants is in terms of tolerability and adverse effects, and notably the risk of harm in overdose .  The\n",
      "SSRIs are far safer in overdose than TCAs, and are generally better tolerated than antidepressants from other classes, although they do have\n",
      "significant side effects . Systematic reviews conducted for recent clinical guidelines indicate that, for people with depression, including those with\n",
      "comorbid physical illness, SSRIs are an appropriate first-line treatment . Among this class of drugs, the NICE guideline for depression and chronic\n",
      "physical illnesses () notes that sertraline and citalopram appear to have the lowest interaction potential and may be protective against cardiac\n",
      "events, with evidence of benefits in reducing the risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality among people both with and without pre-existing ischemic\n",
      "heart disease . Another systematic review that compared the relative effects of 12 antidepressants (SSRIs and newer third-generation antidepressants)\n",
      "found sertraline and escitalopram (the S -stereoisomer of citalopram) to have the most favorable balance between efficacy and acceptability . The\n",
      "balance between efficacy and tolerability is an important consideration in deciding which antidepressant to use (Figure 6.2) . Monitoring use of\n",
      "antidepressants . For people whose symptoms respond poorly to antidepressants, reviewing side effects, treatment preferences and adherence is\n",
      "warranted . Many people discontinue their antidepressant treatment before the recommended adequate treatment period (6 months continuation after\n",
      "symptom remission): findings from the USA indicate that 42% of patients stop taking antidepressants within the first month of prescribing, and 72%\n",
      "within the first 3 months . Patient education . Communication between clinician and patient about how antidepressants work (psychoeducation),\n",
      "especially that they need to be taken daily (and not just when feeling depressed) for at least 2 weeks before a response will be seen, and discussing\n",
      "treatment concerns (such as worries that antidepressants may be addictive), risk and experience of side effects, and likelihood of relapse, are\n",
      "helpful in facilitating treatment adherence . Regimen changes . Increasing the dose may be beneficial, but there is limited evidence that exceeding\n",

      "symptoms can occur in the process of a clinical consultation, questionnaires have been developed to reliably measure asthma control, such as the\n",

      "asthma symptoms is likely to lead to prevention of exacerbations in most, for some patients asthma exacerbations are the predominant feature of their\n",
      "asthma . As asthma exacerbations can be life-threatening and are inevitably disruptive to patients and their carers, in these instances prevention of\n",
      "exacerbations should be the major focus of treatment . Factors indicating a high risk for future exacerbations include a past history of severe or\n",
      "life-threatening asthma attack, exacerbation occurring despite adequate preventative treatment, impaired interval lung function and cigarette smoke\n",

      "escalation or reduction . Generally, after 3 months of well-controlled asthma a step down to a lower level of treatment should be considered . Step 1\n",
      "is indicated for asthma with infrequent symptoms (less than twice a week) and normal interval lung function . For these patients, an inhaled as-needed\n",
      "SABA may be appropriate therapy without a regular controller treatment . Such patients can still experience exacerbations and the intensity of\n",
      "treatment for exacerbations should depend on the severity of the exacerbation (see Chapter 5) . Step 2 is usually indicated for initial treatment in\n",

      "acting beta -agonist for symptom relief as needed . The dose of inhaled corticosteroid at this level would range from 200 to 500 µg daily of\n",
      "beclometasone or equivalent medication in adults, and 100 to 200 µg daily in children . While the best available evidence supports inhaled\n",
      "corticosteroids for asthma treatment at this level for prevention of exacerbations and symptom control, leukotriene modifiers are an alternative at\n",
      "this treatment step . Leukotriene modifier medication is particularly favored in children for whom the dose of inhaled corticosteroid needs to be\n",
      "minimized, although existing evidence suggests that leukotriene modifier medication is less effective in preventing exacerbations than low-dose\n",
      "inhaled corticosteroid medication . Patients who still have symptoms of uncontrolled asthma despite using a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid, or those\n",
      "with more severe symptoms without treatment, should progress to step 3 . This involves the addition of a LABA to regularly administered low-dose\n",
      "inhaled corticosteroid therapy and as-needed short-acting reliever therapy .  The available evidence suggests that use of a LABA at this level\n",
      "provides symptom control superior to that from increasing doses of inhaled corticosteroids . An alternative method of delivering therapy at this or\n",

      "maintenance as well as reliever treatment . At this treatment step, other options are the addition of a theophylline to low-dose inhaled\n",
      "corticosteroid medication or the addition of a leukotriene modifier, but both these treatment strategies appear to be less effective than the\n",
      "combination of a LABA with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid . Patients with more severe asthma and persistent symptoms despite step 3 treatment should\n",

      "usually a sufficient indication for starting empirical antibiotic treatment . If an exacerbation does not respond to such treatment, sputum should be\n",
      "cultured and bacterial sensitivities identified . Several conditions may mimic COPD exacerbations including congestive cardiac failure, pneumothorax,\n",

      "Ventilation/perfusion scanning is of no value in patients with COPD . The first actions when treating patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of\n",

      "exacerbations of COPD . Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs) are preferred as initial bronchodilators in acute exacerbations . Although they are usually\n",
      "given in nebulized form, there is evidence that administration of beta-agonists via metered-dose inhaler and spacer device is equally efficacious .\n",
      "Nebulizers should be powered by compressed air rather than oxygen if the PaCO is raised, to prevent worsening hypercapnia and acidosis . Oxygen\n",
