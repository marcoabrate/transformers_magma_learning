The peg may also separate from the axis completely and\n","migrate cranially towards the foramen magnum, causing basilar invagination and compression of the cervical cord and medulla . More commonly, synovitis\n","of the apophyseal joints at lower cervical levels leads to subluxation and spinal cord compression . The resultant myelopathy is characterized by\n","upper-limb symptoms and signs in a radicular distribution, alongside 'long tract' pyramidal and sensory features affecting the lower limbs . In some\n","cases, cervical spine disease is relatively asymptomatic until the sudden appearance of neurological deficits . A high index of suspicion is therefore\n","necessary, and surveillance radiology should be considered in patients with evidence of cervical spine RA, with a view to stabilization surgery for\n","progressive subluxation at any level . The cervical spine is also vulnerable in RA patients undergoing laryngeal intubation as part of a general\n","anesthetic, or requiring upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and a full assessment is mandatory in such cases . Entrapment neuropathies are also common\n","causes of pain, neurological symptoms and muscle wasting in RA .

Similarly, synovitis at the elbow can cause entrapment of the ulnar nerve or the\n","posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve, the latter causing wrist drop . Again, these features can severely compromise already-reduced hand\n","function .
