      "diagnosis still remains equivocal .  Metastatic spread . If the tumor is large and there is extensive lymph-node involvement, preoperative staging is\n",
      "required . This typically involves chest and abdominal CT, and a bone scan, though a chest radiograph and ultrasound of the abdomen are also\n",
      "considered adequate . MRI and positron emission tomography (PET) are sometimes used for staging indeterminate lesions . It should be emphasized that\n",
      "routine staging for metastatic spread in early breast cancer, especially when detected by screening or when a node-negative T1 tumor is present, is\n",
      "not advisable as the yield is less than 4% . The investigations can result in equivocal results that are clinically irrelevant, but can delay the\n",
      "definitive treatment and provoke considerable anxiety . The aim of screening is to reduce mortality by detecting tumors before they have spread beyond\n",
      "the breast . Since over 90% of breast cancers are first detected by the woman herself, the rationale for regular self-examination is to increase the\n",
      "likelihood of detecting a tumor as early as possible . Screening by regular mammography can reduce the risk of mortality from breast cancer by 20-30%\n",
      "in certain groups . Significant benefits are, however, seen only in women over the age of 50 years . In trials in Sweden, for example, mortality\n",
      "during 12 years of follow-up was reduced by 29% in women over 50 years of age, but by only 13% in younger women . Furthermore, the reduction in\n",
      "younger women was not statistically significant, and was delayed by at least 8 years . There is, therefore, no evidence to support regular screening\n",
      "in women under 50 years of age . This is an ongoing controversy . The current medical consensus suggests that the relative risk reduction achieved by\n",

      "risk of dying from breast cancer is about 3% in the general population . It is worth noting that consumer advocacy groups also hold this viewpoint .\n",

      "NBCC believes that women are capable of educating themselves so that they can make their own individual decisions about screening . Screening programs\n",
      "for breast cancer are associated with a number of problems . Only about 70-80% of women accept mammography . It is much lower in some areas . Of all\n",
      "the cancers diagnosed, over 50% are diagnosed between screening mammograms . It is possible that a woman who is reassured by a negative result might\n",
      "ignore changes in her breasts between mammograms . Since 20-30% of breast cancers are not detected by mammography, some tumors could, therefore, be\n",
      "missed . False-positive results are obtained in about 1% of mammograms . Such results could generate unnecessary anxiety, particularly if further\n",
      "investigations are undertaken . For every breast cancer detected, a substantial number of women will undergo biopsies or surgery for benign breast\n",
      "disease, with attendant morbidity . Although the total dose of radiation received during mammography is low (< 1.5 mGy), it has been suggested that\n",
      "repeated exposure could increase the risk of breast cancer . This risk is, however, low . It has been estimated that screening 2 million women over 50\n",
      "years of age by a single mammogram would result in one extra case of breast cancer each year after 10 years; by contrast, the normal incidence of\n",
      "breast cancer in women over 60 years of age is approximately 2000 cases/million . Small breast cancers detected by mammography may be biologically\n",
      "different from those detected clinically . Approximately 20% of cancers detected by mammography are carcinomas in situ, of which some would never\n",
      "progress to invasive disease if left undetected, and the optimal treatment for such tumors is unknown . If these cancers are treated in the same way\n",
      "as invasive cancers, some women may undergo unnecessarily extensive surgery . Conversely, in other women, delaying treatment of asymptomatic disease\n",
      "may ultimately compromise the chance of cure . Furthermore, there is good evidence that screening leads to overdiagnosis . Many invasive cancers\n",
      "detected by screening would never have progressed to clinical disease .  For every 2000 women screened for 10 years, 43 (vs 33 if not screened)\n",
      "cancers would be diagnosed . This means that 10 additional cancers will be diagnosed, resulting in about 3 fewer deaths (10 deaths instead of 13) from\n",
      "breast cancer . Even though some calculations suggest that this number could be 1 rather than 3, many women may choose to take this risk of\n",
      "overdiagnosis for the benefit of reduction in mortality, particularly if the treatments are made less intrusive . For example, the UK Marmot committee\n",
      "has recommended a single dose of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (TARGIT) concurrent with lumpectomy, which has been found to be as effective for\n",
      "cancer control as several weeks of whole breast radiotherapy, while reducing deaths from other causes such as cardiovascular and other cancers . The\n",

      "randomized controlled trials performed in St Petersburg and China found no difference in breast cancer mortality rates between women trained in breast\n",
      "self-examination and a control group . In these trials, compliance with the instructions was very high and could not be the reason for the absence of\n",
      "benefit . An adverse effect of self-examination training was the disproportionate number of women presenting with lumpy breasts who were then\n",
      "subjected to futile biopsies . The self-examination approach also has a potential problem in that random biopsies among premenopausal women may\n",
      "disclose ductal carcinoma in situ or lobular carcinoma in situ, the natural history of which is unknown . Such findings may result in inappropriate\n",
      "radical surgery or, at the very least, a lifetime of uncertainty and anxiety for the patient . In 2001, the Canadian Medical Association went one step\n",
      "further when it published new guidelines following a systematic review of the literature . As a public health measure, self-examination was relegated\n",
      "from category C (of no proven value) to category D (of proven harm)! This report, as expected, provoked storms of protest on both sides of the\n",
      "Atlantic . The controversy has deep roots . Part of the difficulty lies in the intuitive notion that detecting a tumor 'earlier' (id est when it is\n",
      "smaller) is necessarily better, but it is becoming apparent that not all breast cancers are the same, even if they appear so morphologically . Thus,\n",
      "the disappointing results with early diagnostic attempts, including both imaging and self-examination, probably reflect our incomplete understanding\n",
      "of breast cancer as a process . In the UK, emphasis was cleverly switched to 'breast awareness' rather than regular self-examination . Women are\n",

      "Pathology and biology . The histological types of primary carcinoma that occur in the bladder are shown in Table 2.1 . Urothelial cancer (UC; Figure\n",
      "2.1) is derived from the transitional epithelium . It accounts for almost 90% of the bladder cancers that occur in industrialized countries such as\n",
      "the USA and the UK, and most discussion of bladder cancer relates to this type . Such tumors may be papillary (confined to the urothelium or lamina\n",
      "propria) (70-75%) or solid and invasive (20-25%) . Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is an additional and important type seen in about 10% of cases (sometimes\n",
      "as secondary CIS associated with papillary UC) . CIS is a flat, intraepithelial, high-grade carcinoma, often with increased numbers of mitotic\n",
      "structures . In approximately half of all cases, CIS occurs as one or more de novo lesions (primary CIS), while in the remainder it occurs in\n",
      "association with either papillary or solid tumors (secondary CIS) . Coexistent CIS and papillary non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer confers a worse\n",
      "prognosis than papillary disease alone . UC can coexist with elements of squamous and glandular differentiation . The classification of the tumor\n",
      "depends on the dominant histological type . An important development has been the identification of a common stem cell of origin in xenograft and cell\n",
      "culture studies . This stem cell type has features of UC as well as showing squamous and glandular differentiation within individual tumor cells .\n",
      "This may explain why metastases with variant histology (exempli gratia as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) are seen in patients with pure UC\n",
      "primary tumors . Squamous cell carcinoma has a nodular, infiltrative growth pattern and is usually invasive . It accounts for 5-10% of bladder cancers\n",
      "in the USA and UK . Historically, squamous cell carcinoma accounted for up to 70% of bladder cancers in areas where schistosomiasis is endemic, such\n",
      "as Egypt (see page 12), whereas contemporary data suggest that UC is now the predominant histology in Egypt as the prevalence of schistosomiasis has\n",
      "decreased . Squamous cell carcinoma is also associated with chronic infection or inflammation, such as that due to indwelling suprapubic catheters .\n",
      "Adenocarcinoma is rare, accounting for about 2% of bladder cancers . Approximately 30-35% of adenocarcinomas are derived from the urachus and\n",
      "classically appear as a solid, invasive-appearing tumor in the dome of the bladder . (The urachus is the remnant of the embryonic cavity, the\n",
      "allantois; it usually forms a fibrous cord connecting the bladder to the umbilicus . The remainder of adenocarcinomas are associated with bladder\n",
      "exstrophy or are non-urachal in origin . Adenocarcinomas are usually solitary, high grade and ulcerative . They can be difficult to distinguish\n",
      "histologically from adenocarcinomas of the colon or rectum, and clinical determination of the source is often difficult . Any bladder adenocarcinoma\n",
      "may be mucin-producing . Many patients with adenocarcinoma have poor prognosis because the tumor is already at an advanced stage at diagnosis .\n",
      "Urachal adenocarcinomas present as invasive tumors often visible on the dome of the bladder and tend to be asymptomatic until late in the disease\n",
      "course, since they arise in a minimally functional part of the bladder . Surgical therapy is closed partial cystectomy . Micropapillary cancer (Figure\n",
      "2.2) is a particularly aggressive form of high-grade UC and is associated with a high risk of early muscle invasion and metastasis . Lymphovascular\n",
      "invasion is seen in more than 50% of cases . Amplification of human Her2 and/or increased HER2 protein expression has been reported with this variant\n",
      "and the proportion of the tumor that is micropapillary may correlate with outcome .  Small-cell neuroendocrine bladder cancer is similar to the more\n",
      "common small-cell cancer of the lung . This histological pattern is associated with rapid growth and early metastasis, and may occur as a pure variant\n",
      "or mixed with typical UC . These tumors typically stain positive for chromogranin A (which can also be measured in the peripheral blood) and\n",
      "synaptophysin (Figure 2.3) . The cells have a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and grow in sheets or nests of cells . This variant should be\n",
      "distinguished from undifferentiated UC, which is the least differentiated of the UCs . Sarcomatoid bladder cancer is a rare variant, accounting for\n",
      "0.3% of cases . It contains morphologic features of epithelial elements expressing cytokeratin (which may be urothelial, squamous, neuroendocrine or\n",
      "adenocarcinoma) and malignant mesenchymal 'sarcoma' elements (leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma) . It may be associated\n",
      "with past exposure to cyclophosphamide or radiation . Lymphoepithelial-like bladder cancer accounts for 0.4-1.3% of bladder cancers . Morphologically,\n",
      "it resembles nasopharyngeal lymphoepithelioma, with syncytial sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells with minimal cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, many\n",
      "mitoses and the presence of lymphocytes and reactive cells, including histiocytes, eosinophils and plasma cells . It does not stain for Epstein-Barr\n",
      "virus markers, distinguishing it from certain lymphomas . Immunohistochemical diagnosis includes identification of both lymphocyte and epithelial cell\n",
      "markers . Plasmacytoid urothelial cancer, as the name suggests, resembles lymphoma or plasmacytoma . About 3% of bladder cancers contain this variant\n",
      ". Immunohistochemistry demonstrates expression of epithelial markers such as cytokeratins or epithelial membrane antigen, and plasma cell markers such\n",
      "as CD138 . Expression of GATA3 can be useful to distinguish these lesions from plasmacytomas, particularly in the metastatic setting when the\n",
      "epithelial component might be missed . Nested variant urothelial cancer is also rare, accounting for 0.3% of invasive cancers . It can be aggressive\n",
      "despite a relatively innocuous cellular morphology . Cells are usually only mildly atypical, although the deep interface with the stroma may show\n",
      "irregularity and infiltration, with more atypical cellular features at greater depth and evidence of retraction artifact . Nested variant is not\n",
      "associated with overlying CIS, and cannot be classified as high grade . 'Field changes' of a probable premalignant nature are often found in\n",
      "association with bladder cancer, and range from atypia to mild or severe dysplasia . The term refers to the concept that the entire tissue is abnormal\n",
      "at some genetic level, even if there is no macroscopic evidence of disease . The recognition of such changes is important in determining the risk of\n",
      "recurrence and progression . Normal transitional epithelium has a superficial layer of large, flat umbrella cells, beneath which are 3-7 layers of\n",
      "regular cells (Figure 2.1a) . These lie above a basement membrane that separates the mucosa from the underlying lamina propria . The World Health\n",
      "Organization (WHO) has recently reclassified urothelial neoplasms and recognizes hyperplasia as well as four types of atypia . These include dysplasia\n",
      "(low-grade intraurothelial neoplasia) and CIS (high-grade intraurothelial neoplasia, formerly classified as severe dysplasia) . Atypia indicates the\n",
      "presence of an increased number of cell layers, with loss of polarity of a still-intact umbrella layer . Dysplasia refers to an increase in the size\n",

      "Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project recently reported comprehensive integrated genomic analysis of 412 muscle-invasive cancers . These cancers were\n",
      "characterized by a high somatic mutation rate, similar to that in lung cancer and melanoma, with 58 significantly mutated genes . The high mutation\n",
      "load was associated with APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like) mutagenesis, and survival probability was\n",
      "associated with overall mutation burden and neoantigen load . Analysis of mRNA expression clustering identified five luminal and basal subtypes,\n",
      "similar to those seen in breast cancer, that stratify outcomes, suggesting different strategies for the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, immunotherapy\n",
      "and targeted therapies . Several groups have described similar stratification using expression-based subtyping, as summarized in a recent review .\n",
      "Molecular profiling is likely to provide useful information about the biology of bladder cancer, including clues to treatment selection and sequencing\n",
      ". For example, responses to atezolizumab are most common in TCGA cluster II cancers; potential driver mutations in FGFR3 are most common in TCGA\n",
      "cluster I; microsatellite instability, DNA repair defects and altered expression of specific genes such as APLNR loss may be important for response to\n",
      "immunotherapy . However, this information has yet to lead to changes in clinical practice . Patterns of recurrence and spread . Most Ta and T1 tumors\n",
      "can be completely resected cystoscopically and treated successfully without cystectomy . In approximately 40% of patients with such tumors there is no\n",
      "recurrence after resection of the primary tumor; however, this subgroup of patients cannot be initially distinguished with certainty from those whose\n",
      "tumors will recur (stratification criteria are shown in Table 5.2) . Among patients who do experience recurrence, 20-30% of tumors (usually high\n",
      "grade) may progress to a higher stage . Thus, vigilant surveillance is necessary, as is judicious use of intravesical agents (see page 45) to decrease\n",
      "the likelihood of recurrence and progression in high-risk patients (exempli gratia those with large or multiple tumors, high-grade tumors, or Ta or T1\n",
      "tumors with associated CIS) .  Most recurrences occur in the bladder, although 4-10% of patients develop a tumor in the upper urinary tract (ureter\n",
      "and renal pelvis) and a similar number may develop a tumor in the prostatic urethra, which is lined by urothelium similar to that of the bladder .\n",
      "Conversely, 40% of patients who have an initial UC of the renal pelvis will subsequently develop a UC in the bladder . CIS has a high rate of\n",

      "95%, whereas reported 5-year survival may be as low as 50% for patients with high-grade T1 cancers or CIS without adjuvant therapy . Intravesical\n",
